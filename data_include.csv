Determinants of oral health-related quality of life of the institutionalized elderly,"Andreas ZENTHÖFER, Peter RAMMELSBERG, Tomas CABRERA, Johannes SCHRÖDER and Alexander Jochen HASSEL","Background: Diminished oral health of the institutionalized elderly has frequently been reported. This is not only of significance with regard to nutrition and general health, but it can also affect oral health related quality of life. This paper evaluates the effects of oral and general conditions on oral health-related quality of life for the institutionalized elderly, as measured by the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). Materials and Methods: Ninety-four residents of four long-term care homes in southern Germany agreed to participate in this study, and interviews were conducted using the GOHAI questionnaire. The Revised Oral Health Assessment Guide was applied to allocate participants into two groups: satisfactory oral health and poor oral health. To evaluate the effects of age, gender, number of chronic diseases, frequently taken drugs, carelevel, Mini-Mental State Examination score, periodontitis (for participants with their own teeth), pressures caused by prostheses, and type of denture worn, a linear regression model with the total GOHAI score was calculated with these determinants. Results: The mean 1SD GOHAI score was 53.316.2 in the satisfactory oral health group and 48.717.3 in the poor oral health group. Statistical analysis showed that the GOHAI scores were significantly different in satisfactory oral health and poor oral health groups (P=0.030) and were affected by care level (P=0.008) and type of dentures worn (P=0.006). Conclusions:Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that oral health-related quality of life of the institutionalized elderly is low and is positively associated with better oral health. Keywords: elderly, GOHAI, long-term care,OHRQL, oral health","INTRODUCTION In nearly all countries, the proportion of the elderly population is increasing rapidly. In Europe the number of people 60 years or older increases by 2 million every year.These demographic changes will also result in a larger number of residents in long-term care homes. Diminished oral health of this specific community has frequently been reported.2–4Thisis of significance with regard to chewing function and, therefore, nutrition and general health. It has been stated that oral health is closely associated with a variety of systemic diseases.5–7The World Health Organization, however, defines health not only as absence of disease but also as a condition of absolute physical, mental, and social well-being.This Implies that health is a combination of objective features – that is, of the diseases as well as the person’subjective self-perception. In this context, health-related quality of life is important. It can be affected by pain, functional impairment, and social and psychological limitations, among other factors.Oral Health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) must be regarded as part of general health-related quality of life, and it depends to a substantial extent on patients’ experiences, expectations, and sociocultural sphere.10,11 Furthermore, a connection betweendepression and somatization on OHRQoL has beenreported.12,13 Instruments suitable for reliable measurement of HRQoL have been developed and tested. The most widely used questionnaires are the Oral Health Impact Profile and its derivatives, as well as the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI).14,15 For older communities, the compact GOHAI questionnaire seems more practical because of the compromised ability of the elderly to concentrate and their reduced physical endurance.16 It has been demonstrated that theGOHAI is better at detecting small changes in oral health.16,17 Also, in contrast to Oral Health Impact Profile, the GOHAI was specifically developed for use with the elderly.15The GOHAI is available and has been validated in German and in many other languages.18A few studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of oral conditions on OHRQoL. Research Has revealed a variety of somewhat controversial relationships.10,16,19–21Some authors have depictedassociations between denture status and OHRQoL;for example, lower OHRQoL was found in participants with removable and non fitting dentures.20,22–24 Moreover, it has been pointed out that some aspects of oral health, such as prevalence of caries and decayed teeth, are linked to diminished HRQoL.24 In contrast,other authors have suggested discrepancies between objective oral health measures and OHRQL.10,21 However, less evidence is available for the determinants of OHRQL in the institutionalized very old who are at risk of cognitive impairments. Furthermore, the literature lacks information on the associations between more global instruments for the assessment of oral health and OHRQoL.The Revised Oral Assessment Guide (ROAG) provides a good overview of the oral health conditions and has been validated for use by non-dentists like physicians and caregivers.25,26 It would be of interest to explore whether the results of ROAG correlate withthe OHRQoL. This might enable non-dentists, who often have more frequent contact with the elderly, to detect substantial oral health problems, which in turnaffect OHRQoL. The objective of this study was,therefore, to evaluate the association between oralhealth conditions and OHRQoL (as measured by the BOHAI) for an institutionalized elderly population.METHODS Study population This study was approved by the local review board of the University of Heidelberg (number S-002/2012). All Residents of four long-term care homes belonging to one care organization in southern Germany were asked to participate in this investigation; they received oral and written information. Inclusion criteria required participants to sign a consent document and to plan to remain in their institution. No additional exclusion criteria were stated to enable a wider spectrum of participants to be evaluated. Ninety-four residents gave informed consent and were included in the study.Assessment tools Medical records of the participants were studied to determine age, gender, number of chronic diseases,frequently taken drugs, and level of required care.Germany has mandatory long-term care insurance for people in need of long-term care. Within the system, there are care levels (Pflegestufen), ranging from 0 to 3, that reflect the amount of care needed.For example, at care level 1, a person must need carefor at least 90 min per day to receive money from the care insurance.27 Dental examinations were performed by one dentist(T. C.) from the Department of Prosthodontics, University of Heidelberg. The type of dentures worn, pressures caused by prostheses, and the Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Needs (CPITN) were determined for every participant.28 There were four categories for denture type: (i) edentulous with no teeth replaced; (ii) complete removable dentures (all teeth replaced); (iii) partial removable dentures (some teeth present; missing teeth replaced by removable dentures); and (iv) own teeth only and/or fixed partial dentures (crowns and fixed bridges only; no removable prostheses). Pressures caused by removable dentures were assessed dichotomously as present or not present. The CPITN was only applicable for dentate participants. The CPITN examination included sound-ing of the gingival sulcus of each tooth with a World Health Organization probe. On the basis of the CPITN,dental arches were divided into sextants. Depending On periodontal status, each sextant was given a code that ranged from 0 (healthy conditions) to 4 (severe periodontitis), with 1 representing mild gingivitis, severe gingivitis, and 3 moderate periodontitis.28 Revised Oral Assessment Guide The ROAD was used by one dentist (T. C.) to evaluate the global oral health conditions. The ROAD includes 12 aspects of oral health, including amount of saliva,mucosa and gingival conditions, and speech. Each Item is assessed as healthy (0 points), slightly altered(1 point), or treatment needed (2 points). The sum of all the items could therefore range from 0 to 24, where's score of 24 represents the worst oral health conditions.25,26 For analytical purposes the median ROA value of the study population was used as the cut-off value to allocate participants to two groups: satisfactory oral health (SOH) and poor oral health (POH).Total ROAG score was not evaluated as a continuous variable because the impact of the different items is not equal for the participants. For example, a participant suffering from dysphagia is likely more impaired than a participant with asymptomatic caries, but both conditions would be scored the same. Because the ROAG score is a global indicator of oral health, the assignment of participants into the corresponding groups according to whether they scored above or below the median is suitable for creating a general impression of oral health conditions.Assessment of dementia For the evaluation of participants’ dementia, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was performed.The MMSE has proved valid in screening for dementia.29 Using the MMSE, participants were asked to solve 30 tasks within the dimensions orientation, registration, attention, calculation, recall, and language.Correctly executed exercises are rated with 1 point,while failed exercises score 0. Therefore, participants can score from 0 to 30. According to a review by Velayudhan et al.,30 MMSE scores less than 24 are indicative of dementia. This scoring is considered the gold standard for dementia screening.30 Measures of oral health-related quality of life HRQoL was assessed by means of the GOHAI. This Instrument comprises 12 items that cover the dimensions pain and/or discomfort, and psychosocial and physical function. Each item is evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1(always) to 5 (never). The Sum of all items can vary between 12 and 60; highscores are indicative of few problems.15,18 When the interviews were conducted, a trained dentist (T. C.)slowly read the questions to the participants in the presence of a caregiver. If necessary, the dentist repeated the question. The participants also received the questionnaire so they could also read it themselves if they wished. Responses were recorded on case record forms. The detailed items of GOHAI are presented in Figure 1.Data processing Incoming case record forms were monitored by two members of the University of Heidelberg (A. J. H and. Z.), who also checked responses for plausibility and legibility. Data were entered in two independent databases to compare entries for agreement. If deviations were observed, the original case record forms were examined and data were corrected in the main database.Statistical design Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). For simultaneous analysis of the demographic determinants (age,gender, care level, MMSE) and the dental determinants (denture status, CPITN, pressures caused by prostheses, SOH/POH) a linear regression model was applied, with the total GOHAI score as dependent variable. The corrected R2 was observed. The fit of the model was tested by analysis of the residuals for normal distribution with Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (P>0.15). The regression model was compiled twice:once with all participants (n=94) without the variable CPITN (which is only available for participants with their own teeth) and once with only the participants with their own teeth including the variable CPITN (n=57).The level of local statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.RESULTS Records were available for 94 participants (64.9%women). The mean 1SD age of the participants was 82.919.6 years (range: 54–107 years). The study population suffered from a mean 1SD of 6.613.7 systemic diseases and took a mean 1SD of 7.213.8 drugs. Nearly three-quarters of participants (74.5%)suffered from dementia. The participants’ mean 1SD number of missing teeth was 20.318.9, and 39.4% of participants were edentulous. For detailed participants’ characteristics, see Table 1. Mean1SD GOHAI among the participants was 50.517.2. Participants Fitted with fixed partial dentures had a mean1SDGOHAI score of 53.415.9, and those with removable partial prosthesis had a mean score of 53.815.4. For Participants who wore complete dentures or no dentures, even if they were edentulous, scores were 49.417.1 and 44.818.3, respectively.A median ROAG score of 6 was obtained for the study population. Participants with a ROAG score<6 were assigned to the SOH group; those with a score≥6 were assigned to the POH group. Mean1SDGOHAI scores were 53.316.2 for the SOH group and 48.717.3 for the POH group. Detailed results are listed in Table 2.The regression model for all participants (n=94)revealed that the GOHAI scores were significantly different for the SOH and POH groups, with impaired HRQoL in the POH group. A statistically significanteffect on OHRQoL was also found with regard to carelevels, with HRQoL impairment increasing along with care level. Having no teeth replaced when being edentulous was associated with lower HRQoL compared to all other groups. All other variables, including a positive screening for risk of dementia, did not show significant association with the GOHAI score. The Model explains about 26% of the variance of the dependent variable (Table 3).The second model for dentate participants only (n=57) showed again that care level, type of dentures,and SOH and POH status had a significant associa-tion with OHRQoL in same direction. Furthermore,pressure caused by removable prostheses and the number of drugs taken reached significance indentate participants (Table 4).DISCUSSION This study found evidence that HRQoL is linked to oral health conditions. The ROAG, which can help detect shortcomings in oral health and provide an overview of oral health, was significantly associated with GOHAI scores. This finding emphasizes the correlation between oral health status and HRQoL in general. It should be mentioned that the GOHAIn depicts dysfunction, pain, and psychosocial effects linked to oral disease.15 Also, with regard to detailed aspects of oral health, the type of dentures worn hada substantial effect on OHRQoL. The worst OF HRQoL was observed among edentulous subjects who had no replacement teeth, and the best OHRQoL was observed in subjects with fixed partial dentures,which are similar to a natural dentition. This finding is in accordance with other studies with different populations.20,22,23 Generally, the GOHAI scores found in this study were lower than those reported by other authors,which indicates the participants in this study had worse HRQoL than those in other studies.17,24th Might be related to the special multimorbid long-term care study population. There was no significant association between the prevalence of periodontitis as a measure of oral health and OHRQoL, but another study found that periodontitis affected HRQoL,albeit in a substantially younger community.31 Explanation might be that asymptomatic oral diseases are subordinated in the context of the participants’multimorbidity.10 This finding, however, indicates that there might be discrepancies between objectively measured and self-perceived oral health, as suggested by other authors.10,21It should also be borne in mind that in this study approximately 95% of the participants suffered from periodontitis, and 5% of participants had isolated gingivitis. As a consequence, the unbalanced periodontitis/gingivitis ratio may lead to a statistical bias. However, periodontitis isa common oral disease in old age, and the high prevalence of periodontal diseases is in line with literature.32A further remarkable finding is that the MMSE outcome was not significantly associated with partici-pants’ OHRQoL. This is interesting because objective moral shortcomings as measured by the ROAG score in this study were significantly correlated with the MMSE score (Pearson correlation:r=−0.229;P=0.027, not reported in the results). These findings are in line with another investigations demonstrating associations between dementia and objective measures of oral health (i.e. caries and periodontitis).33–35 Furthermore,another report detected significant effects of dementia on objective oral health conditions, namely fewer teeth and more decayed and filled tooth surfaces, but it detected no association with HRQoL as measured by GOI.36 From this, it may be concluded that the self-assessment of oral health and OHRQoL in elderlysubjects who are at risk of dementia may not always be accurate and may lead to an underestimation of oral problems. Therefore, a screening for oral health problems, which are more frequent in the elderly with risk of dementia, should be performed on a regular basis, by either a dental professional or a non-dental professional with a suitable tool, such as the ROAG.Study strengths and weaknesses The small sample size and the low response rates suggest caution is needed when generalizing the results. The low response could have led to bias:participants were perhaps more interested in the dental examinations because they had acute problems, or alternatively, they were interested in their health and might have better than average oral health conditions. One should keep in mind that this study was part of an interdisciplinary cohort study that covered various medical and psychological aspects,and total exposure for the participants was approximately 2 h. Therefore, many potential participants and/or their guardians were concerned about participation. Although the dental exams were not performed continuously and breaks were offered, somefrail residents, in particular, did not want to participate.Nonetheless, a strength of this study was that all observed in subjects with fixed partial dentures,which are similar to a natural dentition.

Zenthöferet al.252© 2014 The Authors Psychogeriatrics © 2014 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society examinations were performed by only one dentist – a dentist experienced in epidemiologic surveys. Also,prior to the start of the study, the examiner underwent comprehensive calibration tutorial. It should be mentioned that participants were not preselected in any way. In contrast, other studies have investigated a wider spectrum of seniors with more or less compromised general health. One should also consider that this is the first study that systematically evaluated the oral health of institutionalized elderly and HRQoL with a standardized screening.Conclusions Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the OHRQoL of the institutionalized elderly is low, positively associated with better oral health, and negatively associated with increasing need for care. From a dental point of view, a good starting point for improving seniors’ HRQoL wouldbe to replace teeth when a senior is edentulous.Broader use of an oral health screening test, suchthe ROAG by a dentist or non-dentist, may help to detect shortcomings in oral health at an early stage,improve oral health, and thus, increase OHRQoL. This Seems to be especially important in elderly at risk for dementia.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank all of the study participants for their patience during the examinations.

Tooth Loss Associated with Physical and Cognitive Decline in Older Adults,"Georgios Tsakos, PhD, Richard G. Watt, PhD, Patrick L. Rouxel, PhD, Cesar de Oliveira, PhD, and Panayotes Demakakos, PhD","OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of total tooth loss (edentulousness) on decline in physical and cognitive functioning over 10 years in older adults in England. DESIGN: Secondary data analysis. SETTING: English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, national prospective cohort study of community dwelling people aged 50 and older. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 60 and older (N=3,166). MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive function (memory) was measured using a 10-word recall test. Physical function was assessed using gait speed (m/s). Generalized estimating equations were used to model associations between baseline edentulousness and six repeated measurements of gait speed and memory from 2002–03 to 2012–13. Models were sequentially adjusted for time, demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, health behaviors, depressive symptoms, and anthropometric measurements and mutually adjusted for gait speed or memory. RESULTS: Edentulous participants recalled 0.88 fewer words and were 0.09 m/s slower than dentate participants after adjusting for time and demographics. Only the latter association remained significant after full adjustment, with edentulous participants being 0.02 m/s slower than dentate participants. In age-stratified analyses, baseline edentulousness was associated with both outcomes in fully adjusted models in participants aged 60 to 74 but not in those aged 75 and older. Supplementary analysis indicated significant associations between baseline edentulousness and 4-year change in gait speed and memory in participants aged 60 to 74; the former was fully explained in the fully adjusted model and the latter after adjusting for socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: Total tooth loss was independently associated with physical and cognitive decline in older adults in England. Tooth loss is a potential early marker of decline in older age. Key words: physical function; cognitive function; tooth loss; edentulous; longitudinal studies","Oral disease is a significant public health problem.1 In Particular, dental caries and periodontal diseases are highly prevalent chronic conditions that have a major effect on quality of life and require costly lifelong dental treatment.2 In older adults, the loss of all natural teeth (edentulousness) is far less prevalent than in previous decades but is still relatively common. In the recent national oral health survey in Britain, 15% of adults aged 65 to 74,30% of those aged 75 to 84 and 47% of those aged 85 and older were edentulous.Tooth loss in middle-aged and older adults is due to a variety of factors, with caries being the primary clinical cause and advanced progressive periodontal disease also being a contributing factor.4,5In the last 20 years, a great amount of research has focused on the potential link between oral diseases and morbidity and mortality. Most of the research has assessed the association between periodontal disease and risk of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease mortality.6–9A number of population cohort studies with follow-up periods varying from 4 to 57 years have also demonstrated independent relationships between tooth loss and morbidity, onset of disability, and premature mortality.10–17 The potential pathway linking tooth loss and systemic diseases is thought to be through impaired masticatory function leading to poor nutritional status 18–20 or inflammatory responses associated with past periodontal disease and oral infections.21 Tooth loss can be considered an early marker of decline and frailty in older age.22 Studies have shown an association between tooth loss and cognitive impairment and the onset of dementia in older populations.23–26 In a prospective study of a sample of older U.S. men, tooth loss was independently associated with lower cognitive scores at 32-year follow-up.27In a 4-year prospective cohort study of older Japanese adults, those with few teeth and without dentures and those who could not chew well were significantly greater risk of onset of dementia than those with 20 or more natural teeth and those who could chew any food, respectively,28 and in a recent 5-year follow-up in a cohort of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, tooth loss was independently associated with dementia and cognitive decline.29 Furthermore, periodontitis has been shown to be a potential risk factor for cognitive decline in aging cohort,30 although the association between oral health and cognitive functioning may be complex and bidirectional, with worse oral health a risk factor for and a consequence of neurodegenerative processes.31 In that respect, cognitive decline was associated with oral healthmeasures and behaviors in middle-aged adults.32In con-trast, few studies have assessed the association between tooth loss and physical function. In a Danish cohort study,being edentulous was independently associated at 5-year follow-up with onset of physical disability.33 Chewing Ability has also been associated with disability in activities of daily living and less physical activity in elderly adults.34The existing literature assessing the link between tooth loss and decline in cognitive and physical functioning hasa number of design, measurement, and analytical limitations. Using a large and nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized older adults from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), the effect of total tooth loss on decline in physical and cognitive functioning was examined over 10 years. Whether these associations persisted after controlling for socio demographic characteristics, physical health, health behaviors, depression, and relevant biomarkers was also assessed.METHODS Study Population The current study sample was drawn from ELSA, a prospective observational panel study designed to be representative of the community-dwelling population aged 50 and older in England. The ELSA sample was recruited from consenting households that had previously participated in the Health Survey for England (HSE) and included at least one individual aged 50 and older. HSE is an annual cross-sectional health examination survey that uses different nationally representative samples each year. The ELSAsample at baseline in 2002–03 comprised 11,391 individuals who had participated in HSE 1998, 1999, or 2001.Follow-up interviews took place in 2004–05, 2006–07,2008–09, 2010–11, and 2012–13 and health examinations in 2004–05, 2008–09, and 2012–13. Because of the sampling framework, HSE data that predate the ELSA baselines are available for ELSA participants. (These data are known as ELSA Wave 0.)The current study included participants aged 60 and older (n=7,225) because gait (walking) speed was not measured in those aged 50 to 59. Individuals recruited from consenting households that had participated in HSE 1998 were excluded from the study (n=3,111) becausedental data had not been collected from them, as were individuals who were dentate at baseline but became edentulous later (incident cases of edentulousness, n=147)and those with missing data at baseline on dental status(n=57), memory (n=138), or gait speed (including walking aids users) (n=580). The analytical sample comprised 3,166 individuals after excluding an additional 26 participants with missing data in other covariates used in the analysis.The National Research Ethics Service has approved ELSA, and all participants have given informed consent.Assessment of Dental Status Baseline self-reported dental status was measured using the following question: “I would now like to ask a few questions about dental health. Can I just check, do you still have some of your own teeth, or have you lost them all?” Participants were categorized into those with some natural teeth(dentate) and those with no natural teeth (edentulous).Assessment of Memory (Cognitive Function)Memory was measured using a 10-word recall test.35 Par-participants were asked to listen to 10 words and immediately recall as many words as they could. A few minutes later and with no prior notice, they were asked again to recall the 10 words they had heard earlier. A summary memory score was derived by counting the number of words participants correctly recalled immediately and after a delay(range 0–20). A poor memory variable was also derived by categorizing participants into two categories: a poor memory category that included all those in the lowest quartile of the memory summary score (≤6 words) and a category that included the rest of the sample that recalled seven or more words.Assessment of Gait Speed (Physical Function)Participants able to walk were asked to walk a distance of 8 feet at their usual pace from a standing point twice. The Interviewer recorded the time of the two successive walks using a stopwatch. The gait speed variable was derived by dividing distance (in meters) by mean time (in seconds). Ifonly one time recording was available, it was used as a measure of gait speed instead of mean time. Extreme timevalues (<1 or≥60 seconds) recorded in the first or second walk were excluded from analysis (n=56). A binary variable of gait speed was also derived using the cut point of0.6 m/s, the conventional threshold below which the chances of disability and death are higher.36 Covariates Age, sex, marital status, education, total net household wealth, self-reported doctor-diagnosed cardiovascular comorbidities and related risk factors (hypertension, angina pectoris, heart attack, congestive heart failure, heart murmur, abnormal heart rhythm, diabetes mellitus, andstroke), self-reported doctor-diagnosed non cardiovascular comorbidities (chronic lung disease; asthma; arthritis; osteoporosis; cancer; Parkinson’s disease; Alzheimer’s disease and dementia; and emotional, nervous, and psychiatric problems), smoking (never smoker, ex-smoker, current smoker), frequency of alcohol consumption in last 12 months (daily, weekly to monthly, rarely to never),weekly physical activity (none, mild, moderate, vigorous),body mass index (BMI;<25.0, 25.0–29.9,≥30.0 kg/m2,missing), waist circumference (men:<94.0, 94.0–101.9,≥102.0 cm, missing; women:<80.0, 80.0–87.9,≥88.0 cm,missing), and depressive symptoms (≥4 symptoms on 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) were used as covariates.37A time variable was also derived to indicate the temporal sequence of the six interviews (t=1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6) in relation to the ELSA baseline and follow-up surveys. A series of biomarkers (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fibrinogen, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) were used as potential mediators.Age, sex, marital status, education, wealth, smoking,BMI, and waist circumference were measured at baseline and biomarkers at the 2004–05 health examination. All Other covariates were measured at baseline and each of the five follow-up interviews.Statistical Analysis The characteristics of the sample were analyzed according to dental status at baseline (Table 1), and then a series of generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to estimate the associations between baseline dental statusand six repeated measurements of memory and gait speed(time=t;t=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). It was decided to use GENEs because they account for the within-subject correlation between repeated measurements and allow for within-subject missing data.38The association between baseline dental status and poor memory (being in the worst quartile of the memory score) was assessed using logistic regression, and the association between dental status and memory score was assessed using linear regression. The models were sequentially adjusted for time, age, sex, and marital status initially (Model 1), then additionally for education and wealth (Model 2), and then additionally for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities and gait speed(Model 3). Finally, all covariates were adjusted for by additionally accounting for the effect of health behaviors(smoking, alcohol, physical activity), depressive symptoms,BMI category, and waist circumference category (Model4). The same modeling strategy was used to assess the associations between dental status and slow gait speed(gait speed<0.6 m/s) and dental status and gait speed (continuous format). All models used an unstructured correlation structure. The effect of biomarkers was accountedfor in supplementary analyses.Finally, whether baseline dental status is associatedwith repeated measurements of 4-year change in memoryand gait speed was examined. In these models, baselinedental status was again used as the main explanatoryvariable and memory and gait speed as the outcomes, butthe models were restricted so that the outcome at timet+2 was adjusted for its respective value at timet.(Memory at Wave 3 was adjusted for memory at Wave 1,memory at Wave 4 was adjusted for memory at Wave 2and so forth.)Analyses are presented using the pooled sample, andage-stratified GEE models are also presented because sig-nificant interactions were found according to age group.Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 13 (STA-TA Corp, College Station, TX).RESULTSThe baseline characteristics of the analytical sample(3,166 men and women aged≥60) are presented accord-ing to dental status in Table 1. Being edentulous wasassociated with older age, female sex, not being married,lower education and wealth, comorbidities (cardiovascularand noncardiovascular), higher smoking and alcohol con-sumption, lower physical activity level, and depression.Edentulous participants had significantly lower cognitivefunction (memory) and physical function (gait speed) thandentate participants at the ELSA baseline; edentulous par-ticipants recalled 7.73.3 and dentate participantsrecalled 9.33.3 words, and gait speed was 0.750.26m/s for edentulous participants and 0.900.27 m/s fordentate participants (Table 1). Changes in cognitive andphysical function were also examined according to dentalstatus for the subsamples with information for the out-comes at baseline (Wave 1) and the last follow-up (Wave6). The 1,151 dentate participants with information onmemory at both of these waves recalled 10.2 words atbaseline and 9.3 at Wave 6, and the 244 edentulous par-ticipants recalled 8.9 words at baseline and 7.5 at Wave6. For gait speed, there were 993 dentate and 175 edentulous participants with information at both waves; in den-tate participants, gait speed was 0.98 m/s at baseline and0.84 m/s at Wave 6, and in edentulous participants, gait speed was 0.88 m/s at baseline and 0.72 m/s at Wave 6(Figure 1).When considering all available observations in GEE models, dental status was significantly associated with change in cognitive function, with edentulous participants recalling on average 0.88 (95% confidence interval(CI)=0.66–1.10) fewer words than dentate participants after adjusting for time, age, sex, and marital status. This Association was attenuated after adjustment for covariates,particularly when socioeconomic variables were accounted for. There was a clear age variation in this association,with a strong and significant effect in participants aged 60 to 74 but not in those aged 75 and older. After adjusting for all covariates in the former age group, edentulous participants recalled 0.32 (95% CI=0.05–0.58) fewer words than the dentate participants. Edentulousness was also associated with higher probability of poor memory (being in the lowest memory score quartile) in models adjusted for time and demographics (odds ratio (OR)=1.57, 95%CI=1.36–1.88), but adjustment for socioeconomic factors fully attenuated this association. Again, the association was stronger in younger participants than those aged 75 and older (Table 2).After adjusting for time and demographic factors,edentulous participants were 1.77 (95% CI=1.52–2.06)times more likely to have suboptimal gait speed than den-tate participants. Edentulous participants were 0.09 m/s(95% CI=0.07–0.10 m/s) slower than dentate participants. Further adjustment resulted in smaller effects; in the fully adjusted models, edentulous participants walked 0.02 m/s (95% CI=0.00–0.04 m/s) slower than dentate participants. The respective association between dental status and the dichotomized suboptimal gait speed was now nonsignificant (OR=1.11, 95% CI=0.95–1.32). Age Group stratification revealed that the association between edentulousness and gait speed (continuous and dichotomous) was stronger in the younger than the older age group. In participants aged 60 to 74, total tooth loss at baseline was significantly associated with slower gait speed(measured in continuous format) even in the fully adjusted model (Table 3).Additionally accounting for a range of biomarkers in supplementary analyses did not cause any considerable change in the results, although these analyses were conducted with a smaller sample size. Supplementary analysis of repeated measurements of 4-year change in memory and gait speed demonstrated significant association between baseline dental status and 4-year change in memory and gait speed in participants aged 60 to 74 but not in those aged 75 and older. The association between total tooth loss and slower gait speed (measured in continuous format) was stronger and explained only in the fully adjusted model, whereas the other associations were explained when socioeconomic status was included inthe models (Tables 4 and 5). Because of restrictions while constructing these models (requiring data available for different ELSA waves to estimate the outcomes), this analysis was conducted on 1,784 participants with available data.DISCUSSION These results show the importance of oral health for the general functioning of older adults. Being edentulous was significantly associated with greater probability of decline in physical and cognitive function later in older age. Edentulous older adults in England recalled fewer words and walked more slowly than dentate older adults. These associations were robust because they persisted throughout an extensive adjustment process, including for sociodemographic characteristics, physical health, health behaviors,depression, and relevant biomarkers, indicating the importance of having natural teeth for cognitive and physical function in older age.It seems that edentulism can serve as a marker of subsequent diminished function in older adults. A recent cross-sectional study showed that edentulism and the need for dental prostheses were independently associated with frailty in older adults,39 and the current findings provide further evidence of the effect of edentulism on physical and cognitive decline. Edentulism is a crude and irreversible measure of oral health, in essence representing total tooth mortality and reflecting the accumulation of oral dis-ease throughout the life course. Therefore, it is expected that the vast majority of edentulous participants at baseline had been edentulous for a number of years. Because Follow-up measurements of the function outcomes extended 10 years past the ELSA baseline (ELSA Wave 6 data collected in 2012–13), it is assumed that being edentulous at some point in adulthood may be an early signal of impaired cognitive and physical function later inlife. The supplementary analyses that showed an effect of total tooth loss on change in gait speed and memory overa 4-year period in individuals aged 60 to 74 also supported this.These results are in broad agreement with evidence from the few general population cohort studies that indicate greater risk of cognitive decline 27,30 and mobility disability 17,33in older adults with worse dental status.Despite their considerable contribution to the literature,one of these studies 27 had a the sample consisting of men only and a wide age range that extended to younger adults (28–70), although the association was stronger in those aged 45 and older, whereas short follow-up 17,30 and narrow age range 30 limited other studies. The only relevant study of aspects of physical functioning 33 focused on mobility disability by assessing need for help in daily activities related to mobility, thereby providing a subjective assessment of physical function. The current analyses addressed physical and cognitive decline in the same population; benefited from a large sample, clinical assessment of physical function, and extensive adjustment; and included a wide age range, allowing for assessment of these associations in different cohorts of older adults.This study went a step further than previous literature by showing that the effect of edentulism on future impaired cognitive and physical functioning was more evident at a specific period in older adulthood. Age moderated all associations, with generally stronger associations in those aged 60 to 74 than in older adults. Being edentulous was an independent predictor of slower gait speed and poorer memory in participants aged 60 to 74, but notin those aged 75 and older in the fully adjusted models.Furthermore, supplementary analysis showed that edentulism at baseline predicts declines in memory and (in particular) gait speed over a 4-year period only in individuals aged 60 to 74.There are different mechanisms that link edentulism with impaired cognitive and physical function. One such mechanism refers to a nutritional pathway. Tooth loss, edentulism in particular, is associated with impaired masticatory function and therefore poor nutritional status in older adults.18–20 Impaired nutritional status in terms of poor-quality diet has been linked with chronic conditions that are, in turn, risk factors for physical 40 and cognitive 41 decline in older age. Another suggested mechanism refers to the inflammatory pathway,9,21 whereby oral inflammation may be linked to inflammation processes in the body in general. A recent review has indicated strong evidence for associations between periodontal disease—a source of oral inflammation—and cardiovascular disease but lack of evidence in terms of causal pathways,9 but this pathway is less plausible in the current study sample because edentulous people do not have periodontal disease, although they may have in the past. In this group, denture stomatitis may be a more-likely source of oral inflammation.42 Consistent with recent research on cognitive decline,30 estimates for both outcomes in the study were only marginally attenuated when the associations were adjusted for inflammation biomarkers in supplementary analyses, thereby not providing strong support for an inflammation pathway,but because these analyses were performed on smaller samples (because of missing data), the findings should be interpreted with caution.The initial models indicated strong effects of edentulism on the outcomes, after adjusting for time and demographic characteristics. As expected, these estimates were considerably attenuated in subsequent adjustment stages;controlling for socioeconomic status resulted in the largest attenuation by far (Model 2). This highlighted the importance of the broader determinants of health and the important role of socioeconomic status, education, and wealth in this case, in terms of explaining the association between edentulism and functioning.Associations between cognitive and physical function and edentulism were more evident when the outcomes were used in continuous format and less so when they were dichotomized to indicate cognitive and physical decline. This has important public health implications because the association affects the distribution of functioning in the older adult population and is not relevant only for a subgroup defined according to a specific threshold that can at times be arbitrary, such as the worst quartile of cognitive function. More practically, the results highlight that total tooth loss may potentially be used as an early marker of higher risk of frailty in later life.Because edentulism is usually the outcome of a long-term process of poor oral health and is necessarily linked with number of dental visits, these may present a suitable opportunity for early identification of middle-aged and older adults at future risk of accelerated decline.The study benefits from a longitudinal design on a large national sample and the wealth of measures available in terms of the outcomes but more importantly the covariates that allowed for comprehensive adjustment of the associations. On the other hand, available dental status information was limited to being edentulous. Availability Of more refined clinical oral health markers, such as the presence of functional dentition, or measures of dental caries and periodontal diseases, would have allowed for a more detailed and comprehensive investigation of the prospective association between oral health and cognitive and functional decline in older adulthood.This prospective cohort study used a large national sample of older adults in England and showed that being edentulous was significantly associated with physical and cognitive decline 10 years later, even after accounting for an extensive set of covariates. The associations between edentulism and cognitive and physical decline were more evident in adults aged 60 to 74 than in those aged 75 and older. Being edentulous may be an important early markers of future impaired function.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Conflict of Interest:The authors declare that they have no competing interests.ELSA was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Aging (Grants 2RO1AG7644–01A1 and 2RO1AG017644)and a consortium of U.K. government departments coordinated by the Office for National Statistics (PU-10/0431).Author Contributions:Georgios Tsakos, Richard G.Watt, Panayotes Demakakos conceived and planned the study.

"Tooth loss, periodontal disease, and cognitive decline in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study","S Nao Rungroj, VJ Schoenbach, L Wruck, TH Mosley, RF Gottesman, A Alonso, G Heiss, J Beck, and GD Slade","Objective: The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate whether poor oral health predicted eight-year cognitive function change in predominantly late middle adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Methods: Participants included a subset of ARIC participants aged 52–75 years at 1996–1998 from two study sites: Forsyth County NC and Jackson MS. All subjects completed cognitive function assessments both in 1996–1998 and 2004–2006, and the same subjects received a dental examination at the initial visit. Cognitive assessment consisted of Delayed Word Recall (DWR), Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS), and Word Fluency (WF) tests. In the analysis, cognitive function for 911 dentally screened participants was evaluated, and 558 of 785 dentate participants received comprehensive oral examinations, including periodontal probing. Measures of oral health included dental status, number of teeth, and periodontal disease classified by the Biofilm-Gingival Interface (BGI) index. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) method was used to analyze repeated measures of cognitive scores with adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors.Results—Of 911 study participants, 13.8% were edentulous. About 13 % of dentally examined participants had periodontal pockets (≥4 mm) with severe bleeding. At the follow-up visit, DWR and WF scores were lower in edentulous compared to dentate people, whereas other oral health measures were not associated with cognitive function. Mean values declined over time for all three cognitive measures, although poor oral health conditions were not associated with greater degree of decline in cognitive function.Conclusions: In these late-middle aged adults, complete tooth loss was significantly associated with lower cognitive performance. However, neither edentulism, number of teeth, nor periodontal disease predicted greater subsequent cognitive decline.

The changes can be physiological or pathological and can occur in one or multiple cognitive domains (1,2). Emerging evidence has linked tooth loss and periodontal disease to a greater age-related cognitive decline and to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (3–10). An inflammatory model, based on the fundamental theory that chronic periodontal disease is a complex interaction between bacterial pathogens and the host inflammatory response, has been proposed to explain the observed associations (11).However, there is considerable uncertainty concerning the mechanisms that could lead to associations between poor oral health and cognitive performance. Since most studies have been cross-sectional and conducted primarily in older adults (4,8,9,12–18), the possibility exists that poor nutritional status resulting from tooth loss may negatively affect cognitive ability (18,19). Cognitive dysfunction may lead to poorer self-care, thereby worsening oral health status (20). Low cognitive ability in early life may lead to socioeconomic inequalities in oral health (21).Whereas many studies report associations of fewer teeth and complete tooth loss with poorer cognitive function (3,5,14,22–24), evidence regarding the association between actual periodontal disease and cognitive ability is mixed (3,6–8,14,15). Furthermore, periodontal disease exposure in earlier studies has been assessed with measures, such as the community periodontal index (CPI), which are based on clinical signs that do not provide much information about the underlying biology of periodontal disease (7).The purpose of the present study was to determine whether tooth loss and current inflammatory state of periodontal disease, as classified by the Biofilm-Gingival Interface (BGI) index (25), predicted eight-year changes in cognitive function among community-dwelling, late middle-aged adults in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We hypothesized that multiple tooth loss and severity of periodontal disease would predict low cognitive performance and subsequent cognitive decline. Methods Design and study population This present study analyzed data obtained from the ARIC study, a prospective investigation of the etiology and natural history of atherosclerosis and clinical cardiovascular disease of middle- aged adults (aged 45–64 years at the inception) enrolled between 1987 and 1989 (Visit 1) in four U.S. communities (Forsyth County, NC; Washington County, MD; suburban Minneapolis, MN; and Jackson, MS). The Jackson cohort was comprised exclusively of African Americans. In this study, we used data from ARIC Visit 4 (1996–1998) and two ARIC ancillary studies: a) the Dental ARIC study (1996–1998); and b) the Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study (2004–2006). Dental ARIC was a cross-sectional study conducted at Visit 4. Cognitive function of ARIC participants was initially assessed between 1990 and 1992 (Visit 2), and approximately six years later (Visit 4) by ARIC interviewers. Only a subset of participants from two study sites (Forsyth County NC and Jackson MS) received another cognitive function assessment as part of the Brain MRI study in 2004–2006 (Fig 1).For the present study, analyses were restricted to subjects who participated in the dental study at Visit 4 and completed two cognitive assessments separated by eight years (between 1996–1998 and 2004–2006). Sampling and data collection procedures used in ARIC and its ancillary studies have been described elsewhere (26–28).At Visit 4, 4,737 participants from the Forsyth County and Jackson study sites completed three cognitive functional assessments and a dental screening questionnaire, and 15.5% (n = 733) of these subjects reported complete tooth loss. In 2004–2006, the cognitive function of 985 participants was reevaluated. After excluding participants with missing covariates, the final analytic samples were 911 subjects, and 126 (13.8%) were edentulous. Of 785 dentate participants, 558 (71.1%) underwent a comprehensive dental examination (Supplemental Fig 1, Supplemental Table 2).Oral health measures The cross-sectional Dental ARIC study (at Visit 4) consisted of a comprehensive dental examination, which included periodontal probing; collection of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), dental plaque, and serum; and an interview. Persons requiring antibiotic prophylaxis for periodontal probing were excluded from the Dental ARIC study. Periodontal probing depth (PPD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) were assessed at six sites per tooth on all teeth by trained examiners.BGI classification, in contrast to traditional definitions of periodontal status, uses clinical signs to classify periodontal status into five levels. The classification, based on two clinical parameters, PPD (≤3 mm or ≥ 4 mm) and extent of BOP (low, <10%; moderate, 10–<50%; and severe, ≥50%), has been associated with distinct microbial, inflammatory, and immunologic parameters that reflect different biologic phenotypes of periodontal disease (25). Subjects with PPD ≤ 3 mm at all sites were defined as periodontal healthy if BOP was less than 10% or gingivitis if BOP was 10% or more. Subjects with one or more periodontal pockets or PPD ≥ 4 mm (deep lesion or periodontitis) were divided into low, moderate, or severe bleeding. The number of teeth present was also recorded during the dental examination. An individual’s dental status was obtained from answers to the following items on a self-administered questionnaire: “Do you have any natural teeth?” and “Do you have any dental implants”? Participants who had only dental implants (n = 12) were excluded from the study.Cognitive function Outcomes of interest were scores from the following cognitive tests: a) Delayed Word Recall (DWR); b) Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS); and c) Word Fluency (WF). The DWR tests verbal learning and recent memory (29). The DSS, a test of concentration and psychomotor speed (30), and the WF, a test of expressive language, assess executive function (31). Higher scores in each of the three tests indicate better cognitive ability. All cognitive tests were administered by trained examiners. Cognitive test protocols for ARIC have been reported elsewhere (26).Covariates Covariates included socio-demographic factors (age, race, sex, educational level, income, and study sites), cardiovascular risk factors, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, stroke, and coronary heart disease (CHD). Educational levels were classified as less than high school (<12 years), high school completion (12–16 years), or post-secondary education (17–21 years). Household income was coded as <$25,000, $25,000–$50,000, > $50,000, or not report (1996–1998 U.S dollars). A nominal variable representing race and ARIC field centers was created to control for the racial, regional, and examiner differences in the ARIC cohort (levels: Forsyth/White, Forsyth/Black, and Jackson/Black). Cardiovascular risk factors included smoking and alcohol use (each recorded as never, former, or current), diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and body mass index (BMI). APOE genotype was dichotomized as presence or absence APOE ε4 allele (Supplemental Methods).Statistical analyses Race- and sex-specific descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to analyze eight-year changes in the three cognitive scores. The dependent variables were repeated measures of the DWR, DSS, and WF scores. Since time intervals between baseline and follow-up were slightly different among study participants (mean ± s.d. = 7.6 ± 1.0 years; median = 8 years), we used an indicator variable (time (t)) to identify whether the scores represented a baseline (t = 0) or follow-up (t = 1) measurement rather than using actual time intervals. The unstructured working correlation matrix was used to correct within-subject correlations in the analysis.The hypothesis that oral health predicted cognitive decline involved testing the interaction between time and oral health measures, i.e., a model of E (Yit |Oral health predictorit) = β0 + β1*Oral health predictor + β2*t + β3*(Oral health predictor*t), where the hypothesis H0: β3 = 0 was tested. If p-value for β3 was greater than 0.10, we concluded that oral health measures did not significantly predict cognitive decline over time. Potential confounders were identified based on previous literature and bivariate analyses assessing the association between exposures and outcomes. We used directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and a change-in-estimate procedure to select the adjustment variables in this study. The minimally sufficient set for adjustment included socio-demographic factors, smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes (i.e., the reduced model). Fully adjusted models consisted of variables from the reduced model, BMI, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and APOE ε4. All covariates were included in the GEE models as time-independent factors. If regression coefficients of the reduced models did not differ from those for the fully adjusted models by greater than 10% or ± 0.1, the regression coefficients from the reduced models are presented in table results. Supplementary analyses addressed questions concerning cross-sectional associations between oral health measures and baseline cognitive scores in this study sample, study center-specific associations of oral health indicators and the 8-year change in cognitive scores, as well as impact of including participants with history of stroke at Visit 4 in the analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC).Result Characteristics of study participants The final analytic sample contained 911 individuals, with an average age of 64.7 ± 4.3 at baseline. Forty-nine percent of participants were African American; 61% were female. Nearly 90% of the African American participants were recruited at the Jackson study site. About half of study participants had never smoked, and one-third had never used alcohol. There were notable differences between racial and sex groups in socio-demographic characteristics and in the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, CHD, and stroke. About one-third of African American participants, compared to about 10% of whites, had less than 12 years of education. African Americans also had lower income and a higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. CHD and stroke were more prevalent among African American males compared to the other three race-gender groups. Overall, African American subjects had poor oral health as indicated by fewer teeth, higher prevalence of complete tooth loss, or severe periodontal disease. However, gingivitis was more common among white subjects (Table 1). About 40–60 % of participants with periodontitis, versus only 7% of those classified as periodontal healthy or having gingivitis based on the BGI index, had attachment loss 6 mm. or more (Supplemental Fig 2).Cognitive function Over a median interval of eight years between the two examinations, there was a modest decline in mean cognitive function, with substantial variability across subject. Mean changes in DWR, DSS, and WF scores were, respectively, −0.7, −3.6, and −1.8 points, with 53.5%, 67.8%, and 58.2% declining and 23.7%, 6.5%, and 5.2% unchanged. In general, white females tended to have a greater decline in DSS scores while African Americans (both males and females) exhibited a greater decrease in WF scores. The decline in DWR scores was similar across race- and gender-specific groups (Table 2).Older age, male sex, low education, low income, diabetes, hypertension, current smoking, CHD, stroke, APOE ε4, and poor oral health (complete tooth loss, few teeth, and periodontitis with severe bleeding) were associated with a low cognitive profile. The differences in cognitive scores were generally greater for race, educational attainment, and income. There was, as expected, a strong association between dental status and overall cognitive performance. On average, individuals with complete tooth loss had cognitive scores 0.62, 9.08, and 8.30 points lower than dentate participants for the DWR, DSS, and WF tests, respectively. The associations of other covariates with repeated measures of cognitive scores are summarized in the Supplemental Table 3.Oral health measures and cognitive function Table 3 shows the regression coefficients for oral health measures, time, and their interactions; parameter estimates for the first-order effects of each oral health measures can be interpreted as the magnitude of association between the Visit 4 oral health measures and cognitive function, while interaction terms indicate the difference between oral health status groups (edentulous vs. dentate, BGI-DL/SB, DL/MB, DL/LB, or G vs. BIG-H, and one tooth increase in number of teeth) in degree of change in cognitive function over eight years (follow-up vs. baseline). After controlling for covariates, negative values of “time” regression coefficients indicated a significant decline in cognitive test scores. At Visit 4, lower levels of all three cognitive function test scores were seen in subjects with complete tooth loss when compared to dentate subjects, although the differences did not reach statistical significance for the DSS test in the fully adjusted model. In contrast, periodontal disease and the number of teeth were not significantly associated with cognitive performance, either as first-order effects or as interactions with time (Fig 2–4).Generally, cognitive decline among edentulous participants tended to be slightly smaller than that among dentate subjects (positive values of interaction coefficients). However, dental status did not significantly modify the time-related degree of cognitive decline (Fig 2–4), except for a small association between edentulism and DWR scores (p-value 0.0855, Table 3). Individuals with complete tooth loss had adjusted DWR scores that declined from 6.1 (95% CI 5.8, 6.4) at baseline to 5.7 (95% CI 5.4, 6.0) at the follow-up visit compared with 6.6 (95% CI 6.3, 6.7) at baseline and 5.8 (95% CI 5.6, 6.0) at the follow-up visit for dentate subjects (Fig 2).Supplemental analyses showed that dental status was associated with lower DWR and WF at baseline (Supplemental Table 4). Neither fewer teeth nor periodontal disease was associated with baseline cognitive scores on any of the three tests. Associations between edentulism and change in cognitive scores for the Forsyth study center were slightly stronger than those for the Jackson study center. The results were generally unchanged after excluding participants with history of stroke at Visit 4 (Data not shown).Discussion Four possible mechanisms have been proposed for the relation between poor oral health and lower cognitive function: (a) residual confounding by socio-demographic factors or other environmental factors (23); (b) nutritional deficiency resulting from tooth loss (tooth loss is often a consequence of severe periodontal disease)(18); (c) increased systemic inflammatory response (11,16,17); and (d) an adverse impact of cognitive decline on oral hygiene (12). Our study found complete tooth loss, though not periodontal disease and number of teeth, to be associated with low performance on two cognitive tests (DWR and WF) at baseline (Visit 4). However, although all three cognitive scores declined over time, we did not find that complete tooth loss, periodontal disease, and few teeth at baseline predicted a greater cognitive decline. We also observed a smaller decline in memory function among edentulous participants compared to dentate subjects.The most important strengths of the present study are using data from the population-based cohort of community-dwelling, late middle-aged adults, and the quality of examination data. Cognitive assessment and periodontal examination, using a full-mouth protocol, were carried out by trained examiners. Several limitations are also relevant. Our study followed participants in only two of the four ARIC sites (Forsyth County and Jackson), and these differed greatly in regard to racial composition, socioeconomic characteristics, edentulism, and baseline cognitive scores (especially DSS and WF test scores) (Supplemental Table 2).Another limitation of our study is that oral health indicators were measured only at Visit 4, so that information was unavailable on the trajectory of oral health (i.e., additional tooth loss or periodontal disease progression). Thus, we cannot assess whether low cognitive performance influences oral health. Furthermore, assessments at two time points provide limited ability to differentiate true change from changes due to learning effects, random fluctuations, and measurement errors. Lastly, our study examined only three cognitive function tests, evaluating two cognitive domains. Thus, our failure to observe more rapid cognitive decline in participants with worse oral health provides limited evidence against the existence of a relationship.Complete tooth loss Our findings of lower scores on Visit 4 DWR and WF for edentulous participants are consistent with previous studies which found that people with few teeth or complete tooth loss have lower cognitive function in the memory or executive function domains (3,6,14). We also observed a marginally-significantly lower score on the DSS for edentulous participants in the Forsyth County site but no association among Jackson site participants, whose cognitive function, education, and oral health measures were all markedly lower.Our findings are not consistent, however, with previous studies that found edentulism to predict more rapid cognitive decline and greater incidence of dementia (6,24). In fact, our study found a slower cognitive decline in edentulous participants. The many differences between the communities studied in the previous studies and in ours could conceivably account for the different findings. However, when we carried out separate analyses in the Forsyth and Jackson sites, which differ substantially in numerous characteristics, we observed a smaller decline in memory function in edentulous participants in both sites; it was, if anything, stronger in Forsyth (Data not shown). The previous studies followed older participants, who experienced substantial cognitive declines, whereas our study population was predominantly late middle-aged adults, who had only modest cognitive declines during the follow-up period. The smaller overall decline may have limited the opportunity to see a difference by oral health status. Other possible explanations for why our study did not observe greater cognitive decline for participants with poorer oral health – and for our observation of a smaller decrease in DWR scores for edentulous participants than for dentate participants – relate to the narrow time window under observation. Cognitive function of edentulous participants, who were older and had poorer socio-demographic characteristics than dentate participants, may have begun to decline earlier in life, before our study baseline, and had now reached a stable level. Other possible explanations relate to the heterogeneity of age-related cognitive decline, where some cognitive domains decline earlier (i.e., memory function) and more rapidly than others, and inter-individual variability increases during the aging process (32). A longitudinal study in French elderly has reported a lower risk of dementia in lower educated participants with extensive tooth loss. The authors suggested that the observed association was possibly a result of greater tooth extraction in people with lower educational attainment, leading to better periodontal health (7). Such suppression of a source of chronic inflammation could conceivably explain why we observed a smaller decrement in cognitive function among edentulous persons. In this study sample, more than 70% of both edentulous and dentate subjects reported history of tooth loss due to “cavities”. However, 38% of edentulous participants reported tooth loss due to “gum disease”, whereas 6–20% of dentate participants depending on BGI category tooth loss due to “gum disease” (Supplemental Table 5).Yet another possibility is that the cross-sectional association between poorer oral health and worse cognitive function reflects an adverse effect of low cognitive function on oral health status. One longitudinal study has suggested that the observed association between complete tooth loss and cognitive impairment in older adults resulted from lower cognitive ability in early life predisposing individuals to edentulism (22).Periodontal disease Previous findings regarding periodontal disease and cognitive function are mixed. Some studies, including our previous cross-sectional study (33), have found a significant association between periodontal disease and low cognitive ability (3,8,15–17), whereas others have not (5–7,14). Interpretation of these findings is complicated by differences in the definition and measurement of periodontal disease. A wide range of periodontal disease measures have been used, including biological markers (15,34), attachment loss (17), periodontal pocket depth (3,14), and self-reported periodontal status (6). Also, many study populations are highly selected, and results from them may not be indicative of what would be seen in other populations (3,5,7,8,14).In our study, BGI index was selected based on the concept that if periodontal infection and inflammation truly affect cognitive decline, we should observe a dose-response trend in the association because BGI reflects the underlying biology of periodontal disease (25). However, the expected dose-response pattern might be masked by the nature of the clinical periodontal measures and effects of past treatments, none of which can be discerned given that periodontal measurements were recorded on only one visit. Furthermore, although different bacterial species are linked to gingivitis and severe periodontitis, both conditions have been correlated with elevated levels of gingival bleeding, inflammatory markers, and plaque scores.We found some indication that participants with a greater extent of bleeding at baseline (Visit 4) had lower cognitive function than those who were healthy or had a lesser extent of bleeding, but we did not observe differences in the rate of cognitive decline to be related to the value of the BGI index. Our study may have been underpowered to detect an association between BGI and cognitive function because the mean differences between the two extreme BGI groups were relatively small, and cognitive change during the eight-year follow-up was modest (Supplemental material). However, it is also possible that subtle changes in cognitive function occurring prior to study baseline resulted in poor oral hygiene care, thereby increasing plaque level and the extent of bleeding on probing at baseline (35).Conclusion We have not observed a relationship between edentulism, number of teeth, or periodontal disease in middle-aged adults and cognitive decline over the subsequent 8 years. Our study may have had insufficient statistical power given the low rate of observed cognitive decline and the limited sample size, or the relationship may manifest only at older ages and/or in relation to more severe levels of impaired cognition.Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Acknowledgments The ARIC study was carried out as a collaborative study supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (contracts N01-HC55015, N01-HC 55016, N01-HC 55018, N01-HC 55019, N01-HC 55020, N01-HC 55021, N01-HC 55022).

Association between dentures and the rate of falls in dementia,"sima ataollahi Eshkoor, Tengku aizan hamid, siti sa’adiah hassan nudin, chan Yoke Mun","Background: Poor oral health, chronic diseases, functional decline, and low cognitive ability can increase the risk of falls in the elderly. Objectives: The current study aimed to show the effects of oral health, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), heart disease, functional status, and socio demographic factors on the risk of falls in elderly with dementia. Materials and methods: The sample comprised 1,210 Malaysian elderly who were demented and non institutionalized. This study was a national cross-sectional survey entitled “Determinants of Health Status among Older Malaysians”. The effects of age, ethnicity, sex differences, marital status, educational level, oral health, DM, HT, heart disease, and functional status on the risk of falls were evaluated. The multiple logistic regression model was used to estimate the effects of contributing variables on the risk of falls in samples. Results: The prevalence of falls was approximately 17% in subjects. It was found that age (odds ratio [OR] 1.02), non-Malay ethnicity (OR 1.66), heart disease (OR 1.92), and functional decline (OR 1.58) significantly increased the risk of falls in respondents (P,0.05). Furthermore, having teeth (OR 0.59) and dentures (OR 0.66) significantly decreased the rate of falls (P,0.05). Conclusion: It was concluded that age, non-Malay ethnicity, functional decline, heart disease, and oral health significantly affected falls in dementia. Keywords: chronic diseases, dementia, fall, functional decline, oral health","Introduction Dementia is the most common disabling disease in older people.1 There are different types, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia.2 Falls are common in the elderly,3–5 and can occur due to the negative effects of medications, medical conditions, poor nutrition, psychological problems, physical impairment, sensory disturbances, and cognitive impairment.6 Dementia increases the risk of falls in the elderly where cognitive decline 8,9 impairs judgment, gait, and visuospatial perception, reducing the ability to recognize and avoid hazards.7 Furthermore, older people often suffer from chronic illnesses, including hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), and vascular diseases.10DM,11–14 H T,15 and heart disease 16 may increase the risk of falls in the elderly. DM is one of the most common chronic diseases in elderly 12 presenting with glucose intolerance.17 The prevalence and comorbidities associated with DM are on the rise among older adults. The increased risk of falls in diabetic patients is due to dehydration,13 retinopathy, peripheral artery disease, peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebral vasculopathy, autonomic neuropathy, and poor muscle quality.11 Age can adversely influence the heart in older adults. Age-related changes in the cardiovascular system can occur due to the intrinsic cardiac aspects of senescence, primary cardiac disease, and the effects of comorbid conditions.18The effects of cardiovascular problems on the greater risk of falls in the elderly are associated with intrinsic cardiac abnormalities (structure, rhythms), neurally mediated disorders, and some miscellaneous factors, such as pulmonary embolism and transient ischemic attacks.16 HT is also a condition that can strongly increase the rate of cardiovascular diseases,19 which consequently enhance the risk of falls in the elderly.15A higher risk of falls in the elderly can be related to mobility dysfunction and balance problems. Functional decline influences mobility and balance skills in terms of time taken to complete the task measured by Get Up and Go Test (GUGT).20 Oral health is also an important component of overall health, well-being, and quality of life in older individuals.21 Poor oral functioning can lead to systemic illnesses and life-threatening conditions in older adults.22 There is a positive relation between dental problems and the risk of falls among the elderly with dementia. Dental problems can affect postural control, which in turn increases the risk of falls.23 Since the increased risk of falls is associated with morbidity, disability, social isolation, and lower quality of life in the elderly,3 the evaluation of correspondence factors has become a focus. This study aimed to investigate the effects of oral health, chronic diseases, functional status, and sociodemographic factors on the risk of falls in elderly with dementia.Materials and methods This project was registered in the National Medical Research Register (project code NMRR-09-443-4148). Approval and permission for conducting the study were received from the Ethical Committee of the Ministry of Health. This project was a national cross-sectional survey design entitled “Determinants of Health Status among Older Malaysians” carried out in cooperation with the Health Behavioral Research Institute, National Institute of Health, Ministry of Health, and Institute of Gerontology, Universiti Putra Malaysia.The research involved 1,210 elderly with dementia who were Malaysian aged 60 years and above residing in noninstitutional places. The elderly living in institutions and bedridden were excluded. Samples represented the Malaysian population in terms of age, and were collected from Peninsular Malaysia, which was divided into four zones of north, south, west, and central. Data were collected by trained interviewers who had prior experience as interview-ers in projects conducted by the Institute of Gerontology. The average duration of interviews was about 60 minutes. In this study, the association between age, ethnicity, sex differences, marital status, educational level, DM, HT, heart disease, oral health, and functional status with the risk of falls was evaluated in respondents. Falls were defined according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9),24 which excluded falls due to loss of consciousness, epileptic seizure, and sudden onset of paralysis, eg, stroke. History of falls referred to having had at least one fall during the day or night during the past 6 months. Subjects who had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) mark less than 26 were considered to have dementia.25 The MMSE is a clinical diagnostic tool used for both research and clinical practice in neurology and psychiatry. It is also one of the most widely used screening and outcome measures in cognition assessments.26 Functional status was measured by the GUGT for rising from a chair, walking 3 meters, turning, and returning to the chair. The GUGT is a reliable and validated instrument used to test balance and gait.4,27 Functional decline was defined as a time of completion of more than 20 seconds.28 In the current study, the measurement of oral health was based on a self-report of having teeth and dentures.29 DM, HT, and heart disease were assessed by physicians.statistical analysis The prevalence of falls was computed for total samples with regard to their age, ethnicity, sex, marital status, educational level, oral health, functional status, DM, HT, and heart disease. Bivariate analysis was carried out to examine the relation between each variable and the risk of falls using a series of χ2 tests. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to test the association between age, ethnicity, educational level, marital status, oral health, functional status, DM, HT, heart disease, and the risk of falls in elderly with dementia. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. The critical level for rejection of the null hypothesis was considered to be a P-value of 5%, two-tailed. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).Results Analysis was run on data collected from 1,210 respondents who were elderly Malaysians with dementia. The mean age of respondents was 71 years (minimum 60±7.38 and maximum 103±7.38 years). The prevalence of falls was 17% among subjects (95% CI 15.01–19.24) (Table 1). The results indicated that the risk of falls in respondents with DM (20.4%) was higher than those without DM (16.3%). Subjects with heart disease (27.4%) experienced further risk of falls compared to those without heart disease (16.2%). The risk of falls in HT samples (18.9%) was higher than normotensive samples (15.7%). The results showed that the prevalence of falls was 22.9% in subjects with functional decline and 13.6% in the subjects with normal functional status. The findings indicated that respondents without teeth (18.7%) and dentures (18.6%) had a higher fall rate compared to those having teeth (10.9%) and dentures (14.4%). It was found that the risk of falls in females (18.3%) was higher than males (14.8%). In addition, the rate of falls was 14.7% in respondents with education and 18.5% in those with no education.The prevalence of falls was found to be as high as 19.4% in single subjects and 14.2% in married subjects. Among the samples, 13.3% of Malay and 20.2% of non-Malay ethnicities experienced falls. A series of χ2 tests evaluated the association of each variable with the risk of falls in samples. The findings indicated that ethnicity (χ2=10.20, P=0.001), heart disease (χ2=7.78, P=0.006), functional decline (χ2=14.44, P=0.001), marital status (χ2=5.75, P=0.010), and having teeth (χ2=8.50, P=0.002) or dentures (χ2=3.60, P=0.034) were significantly associated with the risk of falls among respondents (P,0.05). The results indicated that DM, HT, educational level, and sex differences were unrelated to the risk of falls (P.0.05) (Table 2). The logistic regression analysis showed that age (P=0.041), ethnicity (P=0.003), heart disease (P=0.011), functional decline (P=0.033), and having teeth (P=0.021) or dentures (P=0.021) were significantly associated with the risk of falls in samples. It was found that age (OR 1.02,95% CI 1.00–1.05), non-Malay ethnicity (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.19–2.33), functional decline (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.04–2.41), and heart disease (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.16–3.19) significantly increased the risk of falls in subjects (P,0.05). The results showed that DM, HT, sex differences, marital status, and educational level were not significant predictors for the risk of falls in subjects (P.0.05). Having teeth (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37–0.91) or dentures (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47–0.94) significantly reduced the risk of falls (Table 3).Discussions falls can cause much burden and cost in patients with dementia and their caregivers,30,31 the assessment of risk factors has been a major focus in further investigations. It has been well documented that age-related changes in the body,32DM,11–14 H T,15 heart disease,3,16,33 functional status,20 and oral health all affect the risk of falls in the elderly.This study was designed to identify the correspondence of age, ethnicity, sex differences, marital status, educational level, functional status, DM, HT, heart disease, and having teeth or dentures with the rate of falls among Malaysian elderly with dementia. In the current study, age, ethnicity, heart disease, functional decline, and having teeth or dentures significantly affected the risk of falls. This project studied the effect of heart disease on the risk of falls in the elderly with dementia for the first time. Heart disease increased the risk of falls in subjects, which was probably due to medication use,34,35 sleep problems,36–38 and cardiac arrhythmias.33 Medical conditions like postural hypotension as a side effect of medications and malnutrition can cause a higher rate of falls in the elderly with heart problems.34 The association of heart disease with the impairment of cognition, disability, and gait disorders 39 potentially increased the rate of falls as well. The increased rate of falls in the elderly with DM and HT can be explained by the association of these problems with cardiovascular diseases.40 This study was in line with other reports 8,27,41 documenting functional decline as a risk factor for further falls in the elderly. It seems that balance problems, insufficient mobility, cognitive impairment,8,27 medications, orthostatic blood pressure, physical problems, psychological conditions, and vision problems 8 enhance the risk of falls in elderly with dementia.The increased rate of falls in samples without teeth or dentures was possibly due to the profound effects of teeth or dentures on systemic health.21 It has been established that having teeth or dentures affects nutrition, medical situations,42,43 social interactions, and morbidity rates.42 Therefore, the correlation between oral health and the risk of falls may depend on disturbance levels in food intake, masticatory ability, and behavioral and psychological status.44The results showed that DM and HT had no significant effects on the risk of falls in respondents, which is probably associated with the confounding effects of heart disease, functional decline, and sociodemographic factors. Contrary to some reports,45–47 our study showed that ethnicity could affect the risk of falls.7,8,48 Such a discrepancy was possibly due to differences in lifestyle, cultures, and predisposition.49 Indeed, lifestyle, cultural, economic, and environmental factors in a specific ethnic group are related to expression of variances in such diseases as hypertension, stroke, and ischemic heart disease, which in turn may enhance or attenuate the risk of falls.Our study was a confirmation of previous reports indicating the presence of a link between age and the risk of falls.7,50–52 Such a relation can be due to age-related changes in gait, vision, memory, strength and physiological systems,8,48,53,54 which potentially predispose the elderly with dementia to a higher risk of falls. The findings showed that marital status, educational level, and sex differences were unrelated to the risk of falls in respondents. It is important to note that our results confirmed an earlier finding 55 contrary to reports indicating the effects of sex differences on the risk of falls.7,8,56 Our study did not confirm the presence of correlation between the risk of falls and marital status 7 or educational level.7,8,53,57 The lack of such relevance can be related to the possible effects of confounding factors, such as social supports,58 income,59 supplement intake,8 sleep problems,30,60,61 environmental conditions,62,63 functional decline, heart problems, and oral health, which may affect the rate of falls. These factors may correlate with the physical, psychological, and cognitive changes in the patients with dementia. Therefore, the reduction of attention, cognition, mood, and motor performances can increase the risk of falls in dementia. An appropriate environment helps to overcome deficits in physical fitness and cognitive abilities posed by dementia, and thus reduces the risk of falls in elderly patients with dementia. Therefore, these factors can interact between physical activity and cognition when considering the risk of falls in respondents.5 Conclusion This study faced some limitations. One problem was related to difficulty in collecting accurate self-reported data about the rate of falls and oral health from elderly with dementia, which can cause bias. Furthermore, the higher prevalence of comorbidities in these patients can limit such studies. The cross-sectional design of the study was another restriction factor that made it difficult to find the exact effective and ineffective factors. Accordingly, more standardized interviews and definitions are needed for further investigations about falls in dementia. How-ever, this study could highlight some risk factors contributing to the risk of falls in elderly with dementia. It was concluded that age, non-Malay ethnicity, heart disease, and functional decline increased the risk of falls in respondents. On the other hand, having teeth or dentures decreased the likelihood of falls. As falls can cause much burden, morbidity, and mortality among those patients, more studies are required to find ways to prevent and reduce the rate of falls. Furthermore, such data can help caregivers to reduce the risk of falls and unhappiness in such patients. In addition, this knowledge can provide an opportunity for policy makers and health care professionals to introduce suitable interventions in order to control the rate of falls among elderly with dementia.Acknowledgment The authors gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of all volunteers who participated in this study.

Advanced dental disease in people with severe mental illness: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Steve Kisely, Lake-Hui Quek, Joanne Pais, Ratilal Lalloo, Newell W. Johnson and David Lawrence","Background Psychiatric patients have increased comorbid physical illness.There is less information concerning dental disease in this population in spite of risk factors including diet and psychotropic side-effects (such as xerostomia).Aims To compare the oral health of people with severe mental illness with that of the general population.MethodS systematic search for studies from the past 20 years was conducted using Medline, PsycINFO, Embase and article bibliographies. Papers were independently assessed. The Primary outcome was total tooth loss (edentulousness), the end-stage of both untreated caries and periodontal disease.We also assessed dental decay through standardised measures: the mean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) or surfaces (DMFS). For studies lacking a control group we used controls of similar ages from a community survey within 10 years of the study.Results We identified 21 papers of which 14 had sufficient data(n= 2784 psychiatric patients) and suitable controls(n= 31 084) for a random effects meta-analysis. People with severe mental illness had 3.4 times the odds of having lost all their teeth than the general community (95% CI 1.6–7.2).They also had significantly higher scores for DMFT (mean difference 6.2, 95% CI 0.6–11.8) and DMFS (mean difference 14.6, 95% CI 4.1–25.1). Fluoridated water reduced the gap in oral health between psychiatric patients and the general population.Conclusions Psychiatric patients have not shared in the improving oral health of the general population. Management should include oral health assessment using standard checklists that can be completed by non-dental personnel. Interventions include oral hygiene and management of xerostomia.Declaration of interest None.","Oral health is an important part of physical health.1 Poor oral health is linked to systemic diseases such as coronary heart disease,stroke and respiratory disease.2.9 Oral health also affects eating,speech and other social and psychological areas of life.1 People With severe mental illness are susceptible to oral disease for a number of reasons: these include amotivation, poor oral hygiene,fear, specific dental phobia, dental costs, difficulty in accessing healthcare facilities and the side-effects of psychiatric drugs such as dry mouth (xerostomia).10–12 The two most common diseases that affect oral health are dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontal disease. Dental caries occurs through the demineralisation and subsequent proteolysis of the hard tooth structure (enamel and dentine) from a build-up of dental plaque which microorganisms colonise. If plaque is not removed, and there is frequent intake of readily fermentable carbohydrates in the diet, irreversible cavitation can occur. This will normally require restoration or extraction of the tooth if the dental pulp has become infected.13 Periodontal disease usually begins with gingivitis – inflammation of the gingival tissues (gums). This, too, is caused by long-standing accumulation of dental plaque in contact with the soft tissues. In patients who harbour particularly pathogenic micro-flora, or whose host response to these microorganisms is ineffective, inflammation spreads to the periodontal ligament with destruction of connective tissues and surrounding (alveolar) bone.Signs of periodontal disease include bleeding gums and pockets were the gingiva have become detached from the teeth. In more advanced disease there is exposure of tooth roots and mobility of teeth.14 These symptoms and signs are often associated with halitosis (bad breath).The end-stage of both untreated dental caries and periodontal disease is tooth loss, which can involve the whole dentition(edentulousness).15We therefore focused on this condition as an indicator of both dental caries and periodontal disease in people with severe mental illness. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of this topic in people with severe mental illness. We also considered the effect of water fluoride levels on differences in oral health between people with and without severe mental illness. Our aim, therefore, was to compare the prevalence of edentulousness in people with severe mental illness with that in the general population. We also compared levels of dental decay. We did this by a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies from the past 20 years.Method Oral health outcomes The primary outcome of this study was edentulousness, usually expressed as a dichotomous variable. We also assessed the number of decayed, missing and filled dental surfaces or teeth; both these indices are expressed as a continuous variable. The number of decayed, missing and filled teeth reflects a person’s lifetime experience of dental caries.16 This is because both dental decay and its treatment leave permanent marks, either through the presence of fillings or the loss of affected teeth by extraction.The total number of teeth (T) and surfaces (S) that are decayed(D), missing because of pathology (M) or filled (F) are measures referred to as DMFT and DMFS respectively. In both, an increase in score means greater dental decay. Scores for DMFT and DMFS vary widely by country, from mean DMFT scores of under 5 in India to 12.8 in the most recent community survey in a high-income country (Australia).16–18 Scores for DMFS are higher than for DMFT as the former counts damage to each surface of each tooth rather than counting the tooth as a single unit; anterior teeth have four surfaces and posterior teeth five. In interpreting both, it is useful to recall that humans have 32 permanent teeth.The maximum possible DMFT score is therefore 32, whereas the maximum DMFS is 148.Inclusion and exclusion criteria included studies with a focus on severe mental illness, defined as a primary diagnosis of dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder or other affective disorder. We included studies using clinical diagnosis or diagnostic criteria. We excluded studies of eating disorder and of post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans, as these are very different patient groups. We also excluded studies of people with primary alcohol or substance use disorders and people with intellectual disability for the same reason. Finally, our focus was on edentulousness as the end-stage of the two main dental diseases. We therefore excluded studies of less severe dental outcomes such as poor oral hygiene.Search strategy We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Embase for the period January 1988 until March 2010 using the following text, MeSHor Emtree terms as appropriate: mental illness, mental disorders,dementia, psychosis, psychotic disorders, depression, depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, mood disorder, schizophrenia, oral health, dentistry and dental care. We searched for further publications by scrutinising the reference lists of initial studies identified and other relevant review papers. We also contacted selected authors and experts. Two reviewers (S.K. and L.H.Q.)independently assessed abstracts, and a third (J.P.) checked the extracted data for accuracy.For inclusion in the meta-analysis, studies had to have suitable controls. Where these were not included we looked for controls from a survey of a similar community and age group, conducted within 10 years of the index study. This is because oral health varies between populations, by both age and over time: for example, oral health has improved considerably over the past 20 years in most high-income countries.19–21 We also ensured that the comparison data came from areas with similar levels of fluoride in the water supply. We determined water fluoride levels from the paper itself where this was given, or from published reviews of fluoridation by region and country.22–24 Statistical analysis We used Review Manager version 5.0 for Windows, a statistical software package for analysing a Cochrane Collaboration Systematic review, for our analysis. We calculated odds ratios for edentulousness, given that the studies we included had a cross-sectional design. We calculated the mean differences for continuous data as studies used the same scale for each outcome(DMFT, DMFS). We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic.This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. AnI2 estimate of 50% or greater indicates possible heterogeneity, and scores of 75–100%indicate considerable heterogeneity.25Th I2 statistic is calculated using the chi-squared statistic (Q) and its degrees of freedom. It Has several advantages over the statistic alone in that it does not depend on the number of studies in the meta-analysis and so has greater power to detect heterogeneity when the number of studies is small.26Th I2 statistic can also be interpreted similarly irrespective of whether outcome data are dichotomous or continuous.We used a random effects model throughout as we found significant heterogeneity in the majority of our analyses. This Model assumes that variations in effect among different studies are due to differences in samples or paradigms and have a normal distribution, i.e. that heterogeneity exists. In addition, where possible, we investigated heterogeneity by analysing data both with and without outlying studies as part of a sensitivity analysis.Where information concerning the presence or absence of fluoridation of public water supplies was available, we also undertook sensitivity analyses as to whether this mitigated any increased risk of dental disease in psychiatric patients.Fluoridation aims to achieve around 1 part of fluoride for every million parts of water.23,24 Where there were sufficient studies,we also undertook sensitivity analyses of the effect of including only studies that used international diagnostic criteria such as the ICD or DSM.We tested for publication bias in two ways, using the fail-safe statistic and funnel plot asymmetry. The fail-safe is the number of non-significant studies that would be necessary to reduce the odds ratio or effect size to a negligible value. In test for a skewed funnel plot, low P-values suggest publication bias.Results We found over 550 citations of interest in the initial electronic searches, of which 38 papers were potentially relevant and assessed for eligibility. We were unable to obtain the full text of one potentially relevant paper which we had identified from its abstract. Of the remainder, we excluded 17 which did not meet our inclusion criteria, leaving 21 papers for formal review(Fig. 1).1,11,12,17,27–43 Online Table DS1 gives details of these 21 papers plus the abstract for which we were unable to obtain the full paper (22 studies).44 Ten studies were from Europe; four were from India, three from Israel, two from Australia and one each from South Africa, Hong Kong and the USA. The most common diagnosis was psychosis, usually schizophrenia. Other diagnoses(in descending order of frequency) included dementia, bipolar affective disorder, mood disorder, anxiety and personality disorder. Only seven studies used ICD or DSM diagnostic criteria(Table DS1). Ages ranged from 15 to 96 years.Fourteen studies provided usable data for meta-analysis(n= 2784 psychiatric patients).1,11,12,17,27–30,33–38 Of the patients studied, 1515 (54%) were men and 1269 (46%) women. Three Studies had data on control groups;17,27,28 for the other eleven studies comparison data from community surveys were available for a similar age group (n= 31 084 controls) and within 10 years of the study (online Table DS2).18–21,45–51 Data on gender were available for 30 327 controls, with similar numbers of men(n= 15 245) and women (n= 15 082); the gender ratio (50%)was this close to that of the patient group.Edentulousness Data on the proportion of edentulous patients were available for 16 studies (Table DS1) and varied from 3% in an Indian Community to about 65% in studies reported from the UK and from Denmark. We were able to include nine studies in the meta-analysis, although in the case of one study comparison data were only available for those over 35 years old.30 Psychiatric Patients (n= 1622) had over three times the odds of having lost all their teeth (95% CI 1.6–7.2) compared with controls(n= 22 448) (Fig. 2). For one study there was a choice of two community surveys as a comparison;20,48 using one or the other made no difference to the results. Restricting studies to those of in-patients (six studies), a marker of psychiatric symptom severity,or those using diagnostic criteria (DSM-III) (two studies) made no difference to the results. We found significant heterogeneity with or without outlying studies and in all the sensitivity analyses.Dental cariesMean values of DMFT ranged from 30.0 in Britain to 0.9 in India.36,37 Average DMFT scores in countries with more Western Lifestyles – Europe, the USA and Israel – were generally over 20.In contrast, scores from India and South Africa were under 8.The DMFS scores showed a similar pattern, with the highest score from Italy (88.6) and the lowest (2.5) from India.31,36 The Extent of tooth decay was generally greater for people requiring-patient care as well as for those with chronic and more severe psychiatric symptoms (Table DS1). We were able to include only seven studies in our meta- analysis. Psychiatric patients hadsignificantly higher DMFS (mean difference 14.6, 95% CI 4.1–25.1) and DMFT scores (mean difference 6.2, 95% CI 0.6–11.8).They also had significantly more decayed surfaces and filled teeth,but not missing teeth (Fig. 3). The results for decayed surfaces and teeth were the only ones not to show significant heterogeneity(Fig. 3).Effect of fluoridation When we restricted the meta-analysis to studies from areas where fluoride was present in the water supply,12,34–36,38the results for edentulousness (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 0.6 to 6.0) and DMFT (mean difference 6.6, 95% CI 73.7 to 12.9) were no longer significant.However, these meta-analyses were based on only three and two studies respectively.Publication bias We were able to test for publication bias only for our primary outcome of edentulousness as there were insufficient studies for the other outcomes. The fail-safe If additional ‘null’ studies needed to reduce the overall odds ratio to non-significance was 103. Tests for funnel plot asymmetry gave aP-value of 0.8. These Results suggest that the findings for edentulousness were reasonably robust against publication bias.Discussion It is well known that individuals with severe mental illness have high rates of physical ill-health, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease and cancer.52 This in turn is associated with increased mortality from preventable physical disease, so that people with schizophrenia die 15–20 years earlier than the general population. Although the oral health of the general population has improved in much of the world,psychiatric patients remain at a disadvantage in a wide range of countries. This mirrors findings in other areas such as cardiovascular disease, where the health of the general population has improved but not that of people with severe mental illness.53 The Results for our primary outcome, edentulousness, were particularly striking. The findings for DMFS and DMFT scores were less striking but still significant. This is possibly because both are more appropriate for dentate patients. It is impossible to record accurately the number of decayed or filled teeth if they have been lost through dental disease.Limitations There are a number of limitations to our study. There was considerable variation in outcome measures and how these were reported. Most studies had no comparison group and we were unable to find suitable community controls for many of the others. Although we were able to include nine studies (n= 1622)for the meta-analysis of our primary outcome (edentulousness),we had fewer studies for the other outcomes. Moreover, most studies did not use diagnostic criteria for the psychiatric disorders of interest. In addition, although we took into account age,secular trends in oral health and water fluoride levels in your choice of controls, we were unable to take into account other factors such as economic status or education level. It is unlikely that gender would have confounded our results. The gender distributions for both psychiatric patients and controls were similar (54%v. 50% male). In addition, community surveys indicate that edentulousness and tooth decay do not vary greatly between men and women, especially in younger populations.51,54Where differences have been reported, women have worse dental disease than men;19,45,48,51 any effect on our results would therefore have been to underestimate the difference, given that there were 4% more men in the psychiatric sample than in the controls.Many of our results showed heterogeneity. Where possible, weexplored this further using sensitivity analyses of the effects of excluding outlying studies.25In most cases heterogeneity could not be explained, either because there were too few studies for this to be an appropriate approach or because sensitivity analysis made no difference to the result. Accordingly, we used a random effects model throughout to incorporate heterogeneity into our analyses.25In the absence of information to the contrary, this model assumes that differences between studies are random.However, although we have tried to minimise the effects of heterogeneity, our results should still be treated with caution.Explanations Explanations for these findings include poor oral hygiene resulting in plaque formation and gingivitis. As with other aspects of physical ill-health, alcohol and substance use, tobacco and diet(including the consumption of carbonated drinks) also contribute to poor oral health. For instance, edentulousness is associated with low fruit and vegetable intake in marginalised older adults even after adjusting for socio demographic and behavioural variables.55 Smoking leads to an increased incidence of erosion, cervical abrasion and gingival necrosis, and other mucosal lesions are reported in people using oral cocaine.56 Psychotropic medications can also contribute to dental disease as many cause dry mouth(xerostomia) through reduced salivary flow.15,57 Relevant Medications include conventional and atypical antipsychotics, all classes of antidepressants, and mood stabilisers.58 Xerostomia Has been found to decrease overall quality of life,59 increase plaque and calculus formation,15and lead to a higher incidence of caries,gingivitis and periodontitis.12,15,57 People with severe mental illness may also have priorities other than their oral health, or lack privacy for oral hygiene owing to poor housing or homelessness. These issues are compounded by difficulties with access to dental care. People with severe mental illness may be reluctant to seek treatment because of the fear of pain or dental phobia, possibly exacerbated by the cost of dental care. Even in Australia and the UK, universal health care does not comprehensively cover dental treatment. It is possible that the gap in oral health for people with severe mental illness may be worsening with the move to care in the community. Many Long-stay psychiatric hospitals used to have visiting dental professionals, and it is interesting that the need for dental care was lower in the one study of patients on long-stay psychiatric wards,11,60 which was described as having such a dental service.60 On the other hand, the need for dental care was high in three other studies of patients on long-stay wards where the presence of such a service was unclear.12,31,33 Another explanation for these discrepant findings might be different levels of edentulousness reported in these studies, ranging from 62% in the study by Lewiset alto around 10%.11,31,33 With severe tooth loss, some measures of caries such as the number of decayed teeth actually fall. To this must be added the effects of societal and cultural differences between countries. Further research is needed to clarify how all these factors contribute to differences in findings betweenstudies.In terms of protective factors, the presence of fluoride in the water supply should benefit all sectors of the population including those with severe mental illness. Restricting our meta-analyses to studies where fluoride was present did indicate that the difference in edentulousness and DMFT scores between the general population and those with severe mental illness was no longer significant. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because these meta-analyses were based on only two studies and could be subject to type 2 error. In addition, we could not assess for the use of fluoride supplements such as in tablets,table salt, milk or toothpastes.Implications For clinicians, consideration of oral health should be part of a comprehensive assessment of patients with severe mental illness.In a UK survey, the vast majority of patients reported that staffon the ward or their professional caregivers in the community had never asked them about any dental problems.1 Nursing care plans on admission to hospital should include the recording of factors known to cause oral ill-health such as psychotropic medication and tobacco or substance use, as well as a basic assessment of oral hygiene. Brief assessment tools are available that can be completed by people who are not dentally trained.61 Nursing care plans could also include the supply of toothbrushes and denture baths, as well as instruction in their use. A study in Missouri Has demonstrated the efficacy of such programmes, at least in terms of short-term improvements in oral hygiene.62 For patients in the community, case management should include attention to oral hygiene and health including advice on diet, smoking and brushing technique. The basic messages for oral health promotion and disease prevention should include the following: brushing twice a day with a fluoridated toothpaste;avoidance of sugars in foods or carbonated drinks; healthy eating habits; smoking cessation; and keeping alcohol consumption to a minimum. Saliva substitutes can help with dry mouth secondary to psychotropic medication. Finally, case managers should encourage patients to have regular dental check-ups and beprepared to address dental anxiety and phobia, if present. Policymakers should consider providing free, accessible dental care for people with severe mental illness. Examples include the ‘Dental As Anything’ programme in Melbourne, which offers a collaborative outreach dental service and follow-up treatment to people with severe mental illness.38 Elsewhere in Australia,Queensland’s strategy to improve the physical health of people with severe mental illness (Activate: Mind and Body) includes the promotion of oral hygiene and regular care from a dentist.63 Although this needs to be confirmed by further research, our findings suggest that there is less of a gap in oral health between people with severe mental illness and the general population where fluoride is present in the water supply. The debate on fluoridation should therefore consider how this might help disadvantaged groups such as people with severe mental illness.Further research should include well-designed studies of sufficient power and with age-matched controls. Given the diversity of findings across countries and the possible effect of fluoride, diet and societal norms, a multicentre study would be especially appropriate. One hundred people with severe mental illness, with the same number of controls, would be required at each site to have an 80% chance of detecting the difference in edentulousness we have reported at the 95% confidence level. Such a study could describe how oral health problems in people with psychiatric illness varied by age, gender, type and severity of illness. The Inclusion of appropriate controls would better establish the relative contributions of lifestyle, psychotropic medication,psychiatric symptoms, poverty and accessibility to dental care in analysing oral health outcomes. Answers to these questions would enable better targeting of services in the future. The role of protective factors such as fluoridation in mitigating disparities should also be explored.",-,"1 Mirza I, Day R, Wulff-Cochrane V, Phelan M. Oral health of psychiatric-patients.

Association between Tooth Loss and the Development of Mild Memory Impairment in the Elderly: The Fujiwara-kyo Study,"Nozomi Okamoto, Masayuki Morikawa, Kimiko Tomioka, Motokazu Yanagida, Nobuko Amanod and Norio Kurumatania","Background:Tooth loss may be a modifiable risk factor for memory disorders, but the causal relationship has not been evaluated sufficiently. Objective: This 5-year prospective cohort study investigated the effect of tooth loss on the development of mild memory impairment (MMI) among the elderly. Methods: Data are from the baseline and follow-up examinations of 2,335 community residents who were cognitively intact at baseline. The number of remaining teeth at baseline was classified as zero, 1–8, 9–16, 17–24, and 25–32. The main outcome for the analysis was the development of MMI at follow-up. Results:After adjustment for potential confounding factors in multivariable logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio of per 1 tooth loss at baseline was 1.02 (95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.03). The odds ratio of edentulism for MMI was 2.39 (1.48–3.86) compared to 25–32 teeth. The odds ratio of becoming edentulous compared to retaining 1–8 teeth in the 1–8 teeth group at baseline was 4.68 (1.50–14.58). Conclusion: Tooth loss predicts the development of MMI among the elderly. Keywords: Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, memory, periodontal disease, prospective cohort study, tooth loss","INTRODUCTION Epidemiological studies have reported that tooth loss is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia. Analysis of twins showed that tooth loss before 35 years of age was a significant risk factor for AD [1]. The Nun study, a longitudinal study of Roman Catholic nuns, found that fewer teeth (9 or less) were associated with an increased risk of dementia [2]. A 5-year prospective cohort study among patients with type 2 diabetes showed that having no teeth was significantly associated with the risk of dementia and cognitive decline [3]. A significant relationship between natural teeth and preserved cognitive functioning [4], significant relationships between fewer teeth (10 or less) and lower Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale subtest scores [5], and a significant correlation between fewer teeth and worse episodic memory [6] have been reported in cross-sectional studies. Tooth loss is considered the ultimate outcome of periodontal disease [7]; thus, it has been hypothesized that the biological bases for the association between tooth loss, AD, and dementia may include periodontal disease-derived inflammatory molecules, bacteria, and bacterial products that enhance neuroinflammation [8]. Tooth loss and periodontal disease may be putative modifiable risk factors for AD and dementia, and the identification of modifiable risk factors represents an important preventive strategy for AD and dementia. A community-based survey reported that, among persons with mild memory impairment (MMI) [9], defined using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 21.2% progressed to illnesses with dementia, including AD (10.6%), vascular dementia (4.8%), or other types of dementia (5.8%), over a period of 5 years. These individuals represent a high-risk population for AD and dementia, although they have normal general cognitive function and no impairment of the activities of daily living (ADL). MMI is comparable to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [10], which is an isolated memory disorder that can precede dementia [11]. In previous cross-sectional studies, we found that a low number of teeth was related to an increased prevalence of MMI [12, 13]. We hypothesized that tooth loss may be a risk factor for a preclinical stage of AD and dementia. To date, only a small number of cohort studies [2, 3, 14, 15] have investigated the causal relationships between tooth loss and memory or cognitive decline. When examining the effect of tooth loss on memory or cognitive decline, it is desirable to exclude the possible effect of the onset of impaired cognitive function during a cohort study on the onset of tooth loss. In order to achieve this, the current study chose MMI instead of cognitive impairment as our outcome variable. Impaired cognitive function induces poor oral health and tooth loss. MMI, however, is less likely to induce poor oral health relative to cognitive dysfunction due to its independence from impaired ADL. The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to examine the effect of having a low number of teeth on the development of MMI. MATERIALS AND METHODS Selection of subjects This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Nara Medical University. We used data from the baseline (in 2007 and the beginning of 2008) and follow-up (in 2012) examinations of the Fujiwara-kyo study. Written informed consent was obtained from each of the subjects prior to their participation in the baseline and follow-up examinations. The Fujiwara-kyo study [16, 17] is an ongoing cohort study of volunteer men and women who, at baseline, were independent elderly residents of Nara Prefecture aged 65 years or over and able to walk unassisted. Figure 1 shows the selection of the subjects. Among the 4,206 persons who participated in the baseline examination, 3,696 cognitively intact individuals were enrolled in the current study. By the time of the 2012 follow-up examination, 159 subjects had died, 42 had moved away, 15 had been admitted to an institution, 260 were hospitalized or were receiving medical treatment, and 734 were non-responders. Thus, 2,486 participants underwent the follow-up examination. Among the 2,486 participants, we excluded 111 individuals who had cognitive impairment at follow-up and 40 individuals who were suspected of pseudo-MMI induced by depression at follow-up. Ultimately, the 2,335 subjects who were identified as being cognitively intact or MMI at follow-up were included in the current study. Study design This was a 5-year prospective cohort study. Definition of cognitive mental status MMI was defined according to Ishikawa et al. as follows [9]: 1) no impairment of the ADL; 2) normal general cognitive function, as determined using the MMSE (score range: 0–30)≥24 [18]; 3) objective memory impairment, assessed by the three-word delayed recall test in the MMSE (Recall, score range:0–3)≤1; and 4) absence of dementia or depression, diagnosed by geriatric neuropsychiatrists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, revised criteria [19]. Higher MMSE and Recall scores indicate better cognitive function. In our study, the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence [20], a self-administered questionnaire, was used to evaluate the ADL. The basic and instrumental ADL of all subjects were independent at baseline. The MMSE was carried out at the baseline and follow-up surveys by a psychiatrist, clinical psychologists, or graduate students who majored in psychology and were trained by a psychiatrist. The impairment of remote memory was evaluated using the Recall test. The presence or absence of depression was evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale short version (GDS) (score range, 0–15; cut-off score, 5/6) [21]. The GDS was included in a self-administered questionnaire survey. Higher total scores indicate a greater number of depressive symptoms. The subjects were defined as follows: “cognitively intact,” an MMSE score of 24 or more plus a Recall score of 2 or 3; “MMI status,” an MMSE score of 24 or more, plus a Recall score of 0 or 1, plus a GDS score of 5 or lower (depression-free); “suspected of pseudo-MMI induced by depression,” an MMSE score of 24 or more, plus a Recall score of 0 or 1, plus a GDS score of 6 or more; and “cognitively impaired,” an MMSE score of 23 or lower. We identified the absence of dementia or depression operationally using the MMSE and GDS screening tests because of the need to shorten the time required for the assessments in such a large-scale community-based survey. The prevalence of MMI in our study at baseline (2.9%: 121/4206) [13] was similar to the prevalence of Japanese community-based MCI [22, 23] identified using the criteria of Petersen et al. [11]. Therefore, the MMI subjects in this study are considered to be approximate to individuals with MCI. Dental examinations Dental examinations were carried out at the baseline and follow-up surveys by two dentists calibrated as to the techniques using the blinded single observer method, with both the dentist and the subject in a sitting position under artificial lighting. The remaining teeth were defined as healthy, carious, or treated (including crowned, inlay, and abutment teeth for bridge work), inclusive of completely erupted third molars. Root tips and very loose teeth that were indicated for extraction were not included as remaining teeth. We divided the subjects into 5 groups based on the number of remaining teeth at baseline: an edentulous group and groups with 1–8, 9–16, 17–24, and 25–32 teeth. Changes in the number of teeth were defined as baseline number minus follow-up number. A decrease of a tooth category was defined as a 1 or more decrease of tooth category at follow-up (e.g., changing from the 17–24 teeth group at baseline to the 9–16 teeth group at follow-up). The Community Periodontal Index (CPI) code of the World Health Organization (WHO) [24] was recorded to evaluate the depth of the periodontal pockets. The oral cavity was divided into 6 prescribed segments, and each segment was subjected to further examination if it contained 2 or more remaining teeth that did not require extraction. The prescribed 10 representative teeth (tooth position: 11, 16, 17, 26, 27, 31, 36, 37, 46, and 47) in the 6 segments were examined at 4 sites on every tooth using a WHO probe. Each segment was assigned to 1 of 5 code levels (code 0, healthy; code 1, gingival bleeding after probing; code 2, calculus present in the periodontal pocket; code 3, periodontal pocket 4–5 mm deep; and code 4, periodontal pocket at least 6 mm deep), or an ineligible segment (segment having 1 or zero remaining teeth). The highest code level among the 6 segments examined was regarded as the maximum CPI code for the individual. The weighted kappa coefficients of interobserver agreement regarding the tooth category and CPI code were 0.86 and 0.55, respectively (n = 30). Measurements of potential confounding factors for tooth loss, AD, and dementia Assessment of education length and lifestyle The subjects were asked in a self-administered questionnaire about their education level (less than 12 years; 12 or more years), drinking frequency (hardly drink; drink on at least 1 day a week), and smoking habits (never and ex-smoker; current smoker). Measurement of blood pressure, interview for disease history, and drawing blood After sitting quietly for more than 5 min, blood pressure was determined twice at an interval of 30 s using an automatic blood-pressure manometer (ES-P2100; TERUMO Co., Tokyo, Japan). An average of two measurements was used in the analyses. Each subject underwent an interview to record any history of disease (cancer, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or dyslipidemia) and current medication. Blood samples were collected from an antecubital vein after an overnight fast. Definitions of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia Cancer, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular disease were determined by medical history and current medication. Diabetes mellitus was defined by medical history, current antidiabetic medication, and/or by one of the following biochemical test results according to the guidelines of the Japan Diabetes Society [25]: fasting plasma glucose level ≥126 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c level ≥6.5%. Hypertension was defined according to the Japanese Society of Hypertension criteria [26] as follows: medical history, current use of antihypertensive medicine, and/or systolic/diastolic blood pressures 140/90 mmHg or greater. Dyslipidemia was defined by medical history, current lipid-lowering medications, and/or by one of the following biochemical test results according to the Japan Atherosclerosis Society guidelines [27]: triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥140 mg/dL or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 40 mg/dL. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 17.0; SPSS Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Two-tailed p values were calculated in all of the analyses. The alpha level of significance was set at 0.05. Baseline characteristics were compared between subjects available for analysis and subjects excluded from the analysis using the chi-square or Mann-Whitney test. Differences in the characteristics of the 5 tooth groups at baseline were analyzed using the chi-square or Kruskal-Wallis test. Trend tests were performed using the Mantel-extension method (for categorical variables) or Jonckheere test (for continuous variables). The age- (65–69 years, 70–74 years, 75–79 years, 80–84 years, and 85 years or more) and gender-adjusted cumulative incidence of MMI was calculated by means of the direct method (reference: 25–32 teeth group) and compared by using logistic regression analysis. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined using logistic regression analyses (forced entry method). The development of MMI was used as a dependent variable. The number of remaining teeth at baseline (continuous variable), tooth categories at baseline, and CPI codes at baseline were used as independent variables. Dental variables were added separately to each model. The effects of age (continuous variable), gender, MMSE-total, Recall, GDS, and education length were controlled in Model 1. The effects of the confounding factors used in Model 1 and the other confounding factors such as smoking, drinking, disease history, systolic and diastolic blood pressure at follow-up, and cerebrovascular disease for which treatment was initiated during the follow-up period were controlled in Model 2. Goodness of fit was assessed on the basis of the technique of Hosmer and Lemeshow. Changes in the number of teeth and decreases of tooth category at follow-up were also used as independent variables in other logistic analyses. Adjusted ORs for a 1 or more category decrease were calculated separately for each of the tooth categories at baseline. RESULTS Comparison of baseline characteristics between the 2,335 subjects available for the analysis and the 1,361 subjects excluded from the analysis At baseline, the median age (71.0 years for available versus 73.0 years for excluded), frequency of edentulism (7.6% versus 10.6%), Recall score of 2 points (24.3% versus 32.3%), and education length less than 12 years (21.8% versus 34.8%) were significantly greater in the excluded subjects. The median number of teeth (23.0 versus 20.0) was significant less in the excluded subjects. Relationship between tooth loss and MMI Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 2,335 subjects by the number of remaining teeth at the baseline survey. Significant associations were found between having fewer teeth and older age, lower MMSE total score, greater frequency of CPI code 4 (worse condition), Recall score of 2 points, GDS score of 6 or more, education length less than 12 years, current smoker, and a positive history of diabetes mellitus. Among the 2,335 individuals, 241 developed MMI. Fig. 2 shows the age- and gender-adjusted cumulative incidence of MMI according to the number of remaining teeth at baseline. The cumulative incidence was 11.5% in subjects with 17–24 remaining teeth and 14.6% in subjects without any teeth, showing significant differences compared to the 7.4% cumulative incidence of MMI in subjects with 25–32 remaining teeth. Table 2 shows the multivariate-adjusted ORs for the development of MMI. After adjustment for the confounding factors in Model 2, the OR of per 1 tooth loss at baseline was 1.02 (95% CI, 1.00–1.03). The ORs for the development of MMI in subjects with 17–24, 9–16, 1–8, and zero remaining teeth were 1.58 (95% CI, 1.12–2.25), 1.17 (0.73–1.88), 1.08 (0.64–1.80), and 2.39 (1.48–3.86), respectively, compared to subjects with 25–32 remaining teeth (p for trend = 0.020). There were significant associations between having 17–24 remaining teeth and MMI, and total tooth loss and MMI. The management of hypertension and cerebrovascular disease during follow-up did not largely affect the association of tooth loss and MMI, considering the slight differences in the ORs between Models 1 and 2. The OR in subjects with CPI code 4 was 1.04 (0.74–1.47) in Model 2 compared to those with code 0–3. A significant association was not found between the CPI code and MMI. Table 3 shows the effect of the decrease in the number of remaining teeth on the development of MMI. In the overall analysis, the OR of per 1 tooth change over 5 years was 1.04 (0.98–1.11), showing no significant association. No significant associations were found between the decrease of tooth category and MMI in the 25–32, 17–24, and 9–16 groups at baseline. The OR of becoming edentulous in the group with 1–8 teeth at baseline was 4.68 (1.50–14.58). A significant association was found between progressing to edentulism and the development of MMI. DISCUSSION We observed a significant association between per 1 tooth loss at baseline, total tooth loss, progression to edentulism in the group with 1–8 remaining teeth, and the development of MMI, even after adjustment for confounding factors. A higher rate of tooth loss after baseline reportedly increased the risk of impaired cognitive performance in a follow-up study [14]. An approximately 5.5 year earlier decline to 50% of initial word recall status was observed for individuals with fewer teeth (less than 10) compared to individuals with 10 or more teeth, irrespective of apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 status [15]. The results of the present study corroborate the results of these previous studies showing a significant association between tooth loss and cognitive dysfunction. Several strengths of our study should be noted. First, we examined a causal relationship in a cohort study. Second, our use of MMI as an outcome variable is another strength. We speculate that we reduced the effect of the onset of cognitive impairment on the onset of tooth loss during this cohort study by excluding individuals with cognitive impairment at the time of the follow-up assessment from the analyses. We also counted subjects with cognitive impairment who were excluded from the analysis as part of the cohort, as shown in Supplementary Table 1. After adjustment for the confounding factors in Model 2, per 1 tooth loss at baseline showed a marginally significant relationship (p = 0.063). The ORs of 17–24 and zero remaining teeth at baseline were 1.54 (95% CI, 1.14–2.08) and 1.90 (1.24–2.91) (p for trend = 0.033). The differences in the observed results between Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1 were slight. Third, we examined whether changes in the number of teeth during the duration of the study increased the risk of MMI (Table 3). Within a limited duration of 5 years, we did not see an increase of risk of MMI in individuals with 9 or more teeth at baseline. However, we observed an increased risk of conversion from “cognitively intact” to MMI when individuals in the 1–8 group proceeded to edentulism due to additional tooth loss during the study. The subjects that developed MMI in the current study maintained the basic and instrumental ADL at baseline. Therefore, there may be other biological bases different from a causal relationship in which a memory disorder induces poor oral conditions. Plausible biological explanations for the relationship between tooth loss and memory disorder include: 1) the inflammatory burden of periodontal disease; 2) genetic risk factors related to both periodontal disease and MMI; 3) a reduction of afferent input from sensory receptors; and 4) further confounding factors related to both tooth loss and MMI. First, periodontal disease, which is a chronic infection of tissue surrounding the teeth by Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, is the cause of a large number of missing teeth. Periodontal disease is related to systemic disease, such as carotid artery plaque [28], heart disease [29], and increased blood pressure [30]. Significant associations between the loss of periodontal attachment and worse cognitive function [31], and significant associations between the presence of antibodies against periodontal bacteria and poor delayed verbal recall [32] and the risk of AD [33, 34] have also been reported in cross-sectional studies and a nested case-control study. Even if one loses teeth affected by periodontal disease, systemic damage may persist somewhat [28]. Inflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of AD [35, 36]; it has been hypothesized that inflammatory cytokines induced by periodontal infection and bacterial endotoxins can enter the brain and exacerbate a pre existing AD inflammatory pathology [37, 38]. Second, polymorphic cytokine genotypes may be related to periodontal disease and the risk of MMI. For example, interleukin (IL)-1A (-889) and IL-1B (+3953) gene polymorphisms are reportedly associated with the severity of periodontal disease [39, 40] and the risk of AD [41, 42]. Third, tooth loss or the reduction of mastication may affect the central nervous system. A study revealed a decrease in the number of choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons present in the nucleus of the diagonal band/medial septal nucleus in molar crown-cut off rats [43]. A decrease in the number of pyramidal cells was observed in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas of molar-loss mice [44]. The number of high-affinity tyrosine kinase B mRNA-positive cells in the hippocampal CA3 area was negatively affected by the duration of tooth loss and the number of teeth extracted [45]. These findings are based on animal models, and further investigations in humans will be needed. Fourth, tooth loss may induce nutritional deficits and, as a consequence, tooth loss may be associated with dementia [46]. Maintaining healthy vitamin C levels can have a protective function against age-related cognitive decline and AD [47]. Total tooth loss was associated with low citrus fruit consumption and low plasma vitamin C levels [48]. Low socioeconomic status, negative events earlier in life, and head trauma with maxillofacial injuries may also be confounding factors related to tooth loss and memory disorders. A significant association was not seen between the CPI code and MMI in this study (Table 2). The CPI is suitable for the evaluation of current inflammatory swelling of the gingivae. Thus, the association between MMI status and the burden of past periodontal disease may be underestimated by this approach. In Table 2, the ORs of 9–16 and 1–8 teeth for the development of MMI were not significant, but the OR of 17–24 teeth was significant. The proportion of subjects who had CPI code 3 or 4 (worse condition) was significantly higher in the 17–24 teeth group than in the 25–32 teeth group (74.3% versus 60.5%, respectively, p < 0.001) (Table 1). The subjects in the 17–24 teeth group can be expected to have had larger numbers of teeth affected by periodontal disease than those in the 25–32 teeth group. Thus, the finding that the OR of the 17–24 teeth group was significant also supports the hypothesis that periodontal disease increases the risk of MMI. Six limitations of the present study merit consideration. The primary limitation is that our results are biased by the exclusion of subjects who did not return for the follow-up examination. The proportions of edentulous individuals and individuals with baseline Recall scores of 2 points were greater in the excluded subjects. We speculate that a high-risk population for the development of MMI was excluded in this study. It is unclear whether the association between tooth loss and MMI was overestimated or underestimated. Second, the MMSE score depends on age and education. We might have defined some participants as cognitively intact, MMI, or cognitively impaired by mistake. Third, the CPI was selected as the index for evaluating periodontal disease. The CPI is sometimes used in epidemiologic surveys; however, it is difficult to evaluate cumulative inflammatory burden using the CPI. If cost and time limitations had permitted, radiographic evaluation of alveolar bone resorption of all teeth would have been more suitable. Fourth, we did not assess the extent to which dental caries or trauma accounted for tooth loss. Thus, we might have overestimated the relationship between periodontal disease and MMI. It would be practically difficult to conduct a dental chart review to verify the reasons for the loss of every tooth in each of the participants in their respective dental clinics. Fifth, we did not assess when the subjects lost their teeth. It is unclear how long it takes for MMI to develop after a decrease in the remaining number of teeth. Finally, APOE genotyping was not performed. APOE 4 carrier status was reportedly associated with lower scores on the delayed recall examination [49] and APOE 4 allele frequency was significantly higher in patients with early stage cognitive impairment versus healthy controls [50]. Considering the presence of APOE 4 carriers in the MMI group, our findings might have overestimated the relationship between tooth loss and MMI. Within the limitations of the study design described above, the results of this study showed that tooth loss may be an independent risk factor for MMI. Preventive measures against tooth loss at a younger age may be effective at reducing the risk of memory disorders.

"Tooth loss, dementia and neuropathology in the Nun Study","Pamela Sparks Stein, DMD; Mark Desrosiers, PhD; Sara Jean Donegan, SSND, DDS; Juan F. Yepes, DDS, MD, MPH; Richard J. Kryscio, PhD","Background: Numerous studies have linked dementia to the subsequent deterioration of oral health. Few investigators, however, have examined oral disease as a potential risk factor in the development of dementia. The authors conducted a study to investigate a potential association between a history of oral disease and the development of dementia. Methods: Longitudinal dental records supplemented data collected from 10 annual cognitive assessments of 144 Milwaukee participants in the Nun Study, a longitudinal study of aging and Alzheimer disease, who were 75 to 98 years old. Neuropathologic findings at autopsy were available for 118 participants who died. Results: A low number of teeth increased the risk of higher prevalence and incidence of dementia. Conclusion: Participants with the fewest teeth had the highest risk of prevalence and incidence of dementia. Clinical Implications. Edentulism or very few (one to nine) teeth may be predictors of dementia late in life. Key Words: Epidemiology; periodontal disease; Alzheimer disease. JADA 2007;138(10):1314-22.","Many cross-sectional studies 1-14 and some longitudinal studies 15,16 have shown that patients with dementia are more likely to have poor oral health. Few investigators,17-19 however, have attempted to relate oral disease to the subsequent risk of developing cognitive impairments and dementia. Such an association is biologically plausible.20 Potential mechanisms include inflammatory mediators produced in response to periodontal pathogens,21-28 which produce chronic systemic inflammation and neuropathology; increased risk of stroke and cerebrovascular injury in those with periodontal disease 29-34; and dissemination of oral gram-negative bacteria to the brain 35-46 via a transient bacteremia. Oral bacteria also may spread to the brain via neuronal pathways. Riviere and colleagues 47 suggested that oral bacteria may use branches of the trigeminal nerve to reach the brain. In their postmortem examination of brain tissues, they detected antigens of oral treponemes more often in samples from subjects with Alzheimer disease (14 of 16) than in
samples from control subjects (four of 18). The Nun Study, a longitudinal study of aging and Alzheimer disease, offers a unique model for the study of oral health and cognitive function. Participants in the Nun Study are Roman Catholic sisters who are members of the international congregation of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. At the first examination, conducted from 1991 through 1993, the 678 sisters who agreed to participate in all phases of the study—including annual cognitive assessments and brain donation on death—were 75 to 102 years old (mean age, 83 years). Two hundred of these Nun Study participants were members of the Milwaukee province (region) of the congregation, and 165 had been dental patients of the Milwaukee province dentist (S.J.D.). We limited this study to Nun Study participants in the Milwaukee province because it was the only province that had an on-site dental clinic and a full-time dental staff. The Milwaukee province dentist began practicing in 1964 and has remained the dentist for the sisters since that time. Combining 40 years of longitudinal dental data from a private practice and 12 years of longitudinal findings from annual cognitive assessments with brain autopsies from the Nun Study provides an unparalleled opportunity to study dental health, dementia and neuropathology. Dementia is a complex and multifactorial disease, and it is unlikely that any one mechanism is completely causal. However, specific risk factors have been identified that increase the probability for developing Alzheimer disease. In 1993, a polymorphism in the apolipoprotein E4 allele (apoE4) was discovered to be a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease.48 This gene promotes the deposition of beta-amyloid protein in the brain, contributing to the formation of senile plaques. People who have inherited a single E4 allele of apolipoprotein (APOE) experience a twofold to fivefold increase in risk of developing Alzheimer disease.49 We investigated the relationships between tooth loss, dementia and neuropathology in participants in the Nun Study, a study that already has yielded much data on dementia and neuropathology.50-58 MATERIALS AND METHODS Study population. Of the 165 Nun Study participants who were patients of the Milwaukee province dentist (S.J.D.), 148 were patients before and after they participated in the first cognitive assessment in the Nun Study. For two of those patients, there were no data on the presence or absence of apoE4. Two additional patients who were found to have dementia at the first examination had a history of psychiatric conditions dating back to early adult life. Elimination of these four patients resulted in a final sample of 144 Nun Study participants. Characteristics of our sample of 144 participants were similar to those of the total Nun Study population of 678 sisters. The 144 participants in this study were 75 to 98 years old (mean age, 84 years) at their first cognitive examination. This differs only slightly from the entire population of 678 participants, who ranged in age from 75 to 102 years. Eighty-five percent of the participants in our subset had attained at least a bachelor’s degree, 88 percent had been teachers most of their lives, and 22 percent had one or more copies of the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease, the apoE4 allele. Of the other Nun Study participants not included in our sample, 84 percent had attained at least a bachelor’s degree, 90 percent had been teachers most of their lives, and 23 percent had one or more copies of apoE4. Nun Study participants live in one of seven provinces throughout the United States. These provinces are located in rural areas such as Chatawa, Miss., Wilton, Conn., and Mankato, Minn, and urban areas such as Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore and Milwaukee, the province from which we obtained our subset. Although these sisters live in different areas throughout the United States, their living conditions, diet and medical care are similar. Oral and dental health. Information contained in the dental records included clinical notes made by the Milwaukee province dentist (S.J.D.) regarding treatment, as well as the charting of missing, carious and restored teeth. In most cases, the records contained radiographs. Documented or written information regarding the periodontal status of the patients (probing depths, clinical attachment level, percentage of sites with bleeding at probing and periodontal diagnosis) was not available in the patients’ records. Another dentist (P.S.S.) reviewed each participant’s dental record, documenting the number of teeth observed and lost across time during the participant’s tenure as a patient. She recorded the date and reason for each extraction. Reasons included periodontal disease, caries, breakage, periapical disease, pain, failed restoration and multiple causes. Using these longitudinal data, we determined the number of non–third molars for the date of the first cognitive examination. The primary consideration in categorizing the number of non–third molars present was to create groups of at least 10 participants at the extremes of the continuum of the number of teeth present. A group with one to nine non–third molars was at one end of that continuum. (We kept the edentulous separate from this group because they did not have active periodontal disease or other dental diseases.) At the other end of the continuum, we created a group with 17 to 28 non–third molars. We created a middle category with 10 to 16 non–third molars. Medical history assessment. Most of the dental records contained medical histories. A dentist (P.S.S.) reviewed the medical histories, documenting for each subject the presence or history of any medical conditions known to be associated with an inflammatory process. Five physicians collaborated to create the list of inflammatory conditions, which included allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cardiovascular disease, Crohn disease, eczema, lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, rosacea, temporal arteritis and ulcerative colitis. Radiographic examination. We used full-mouth radiographs obtained before the first cognitive examination to assess alveolar bone loss and damage to periodontal tissues. One of the authors (J.F.Y.) performed all radiographic examinations under ideal conditions (in a dark-room using a magnifier and a viewing box). The same independent observer, who had experience in radiograph interpretation, measured the marginal bone level by means of a calibrated rule. We based the radiographic measurements on alveolar bone loss from the cementoenamel junction. We classified the degree of periodontal damage of the participants by using methodology and criteria previously described by Jansson and colleagues.59 We classified participants who had 4 to 6 millimeters of alveolar bone loss in 33 percent or more of their teeth as having moderate periodontal damage and those with more than 6 mm of alveolar bone loss in 33 percent or more of their teeth as having severe periodontal damage. Because of the low number of participants classified as having severe periodontal damage (1.3 percent), we combined the moderate and severe categories. Cognitive function and dementia. Two field-trained gerontologists assessed the participants’ cognitive function annually by a battery of tests. These tests evaluated memory, concentration, language, visuospatial ability, and orientation to time and place.60 The gerontologists assessed social and daily physical functions by means of performance-based testing.61,62 Participants classified as having intact (high) cognitive function had normal global cognitive and physical
function (as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and Activities of Daily Living), as well as scores within normal limits on tests of memory, language and visuospatial ability (as measured by scores on the Delayed Word Recall Test,60 the Boston Naming Test,60,63 the verbal fluency test and constructional praxis test 60) (as described by Riley and colleagues 55). Participants considered to have dementia according to Nun Study criteria had each of the following conditions: impairment in memory; impairment in at least one other area of cognition, such as language or visuospatial ability; impairment in social or daily function, such as inability to use a phone or handle money.55 apoE genotyping. Two scientists performed genotyping by using genetic material from buccal cells collected from living participants by a field-trained gerontologist or from frozen or paraffin-embedded brain specimens obtained at autopsy by the neuropathologist for the Nun Study according to a protocol already described.64,65 On the basis of the six standard apoE genotypes (2/2, 2/3, 2/4, 3/3, 3/4, 4/4), we used a binary variable coded as presence or absence of any E4 allele.
Neuropathology. A neuropathologist who was blinded to the participants’ cognitive test scores performed standard gross and microscopic evaluations of the participants’ brains (n = 118) according to previously described protocol.56 He identified brain infarcts by examining the intact brain and 1.5-centimeter–thick coronal sections of the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem and cerebellum. He classified infarcts visible to the naked eye as either lacunar (< 1.5 cm) or large (> 1.5 cm) (a classification described by Snowdon and colleagues 50). He determined the severity of Alzheimer disease neuropathology using the staging method of Braak and Braak.66 Braak stage 0 includes cases without any entorhinal or hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles or only extremely rare transentorhinal tangles; stages I and II indicate neurofibrillary disease in the entorhinal cortex; stages III and IV involve increasing neurofibrillary disease in the entorhinal cortex and in other medial temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus and the amygdala; and stages V and VI involve additional neurofibrillary disease in the neocortex.66,67 Statistical methods. We used logistic regression to analyze prevalence data and derive adjusted odds ratios (ORs). The main independent variable was the number of non–third molars. We coded categories of teeth as 0 for the edentulous group, 1 for those with one to nine teeth, 2 for those with 10 to 16 teeth, and 3 for those with 17 to 28 teeth. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate hazards ratios for incidence data.68 We coded the following covariates as binary variables: college education, presence of apoE4, brain infarct identified at autopsy, presence of moderate-to-severe damage to periodontal tissues and presence of any medical inflammatory condition. All correlations were Spearman rank correlations. A test for trend was based on the Cochran-Armitage statistic for the percentage who lost a tooth owing to periodontitis as well as on a test for linearity in a one-way analysis of variance for the mean number of teeth lost due to periodontitis. We used two-tailed P values in all analyses. The statistical package we used was SAS/STAT (Version 9, SAS System for Windows, SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). The α level of significance for our analysis was .05. RESULTS In the subset of 144 participants in our study, the first cognitive examinations took place between October 1991 and October 1992. The number of non–third molars teeth present had a strong inverse association with past tooth loss due to periodontal disease as determined by clinician’s notes (Table 1). The number of non–third molars also was inversely correlated with age (r = −0.41; P < .0001) and positively associated with attained education (χ2 = 24.3; P < .0001), but was not associated with the presence of apoE4 (χ2 = 2.7; P = .44). Approximately one-third of the participants with no teeth or very few teeth (one to nine) had dementia at the first cognitive examination (Table 2). In those with 10 or more teeth, the percentage with dementia was 17 percent or less. Adjusting for age and education, we found that the number of non–third molars present was not significantly associated with dementia prevalence at the first cognitive assessment in the total population of all participants. We tested for effect sizes and found a significant interaction between the number of teeth and apoE4 (P = .04)—that is, the allele was a statistically significant modifier of the association between tooth loss and dementia prevalence. The interactions between number of teeth and age or education were not statistically significant. Table 2 shows the prevalence of dementia in the total population of participants (n = 144) and two subsets, one with apoE4 (n = 32) and one without (n = 112). In the 112 participants without apoE4, a low number of teeth (one to nine) was significantly associated with dementia prevalence after we adjusted for age and education. A combined category (zero to nine), comprising the edentulous and group with a low number of teeth (one to nine), also was significantly associated with dementia prevalence (OR = 4.3, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = [1.16-15.60], P = .03). Medical histories were available for 133 participants. Sixty had one or more medical conditions associated with documented inflammatory disease. Adding the risk factor of inflammatory disease did not alter the significance of the association between those with one to nine teeth and the prevalence of dementia in the subset of the population without apoE4, but in fact increased the OR (OR = 8.2, 95 percent CI = [1.34-49.80] P = .02). The categories of the number of teeth were not associated with the presence of one or more inflammatory conditions (χ2 = 1.5; P = .67). Full-mouth radiographs obtained before the first cognitive examination were available for 76 participants. All participants had some alveolar bone loss; 68 percent had slight periodontal damage, 30 percent had moderate periodontal damage, and 1 percent had severe periodontal damage. There was a significant inverse relationship between the number of teeth and moderate-to-severe periodontal damage as assessed via radiographic examination (r = −0.31, P = .01). Adjusting for age, education and apoE4, we found that moderate-to-severe periodontal damage, as evidenced by alveolar bone loss, was not associated with dementia at the first cognitive examination (OR = 1.5, 95 percent CI = [0.37-5.8]) or incidence of dementia (hazards ratio = 2.4, 95 percent CI = [0.86-6.6). Nor was it related to Alzheimer disease neuropathology (χ2 = 1.1, P = .29) or brain infarcts (2 0.21, P = .65). We based our incidence analysis on the 101 participants who did not have dementia at the first examination and who had undergone at least one additional cognitive examination. We further collapsed the four tooth categories into two categories, a low number of teeth (zero to nine) and a high number of teeth (10 to 28), owing to the similarities of these categories found in the prevalence analysis. Adjusting for age, education and presence of apoE4, we found that presence of a low number of non–third molars (zero to nine) was associated with the incidence of dementia during the subsequent 12 years of observation in the Nun Study (Table 3). Only 15 of the 101 participants had apoE4; no one in the zero-to-nine tooth category in this group developed dementia. Thus, we could not test for an interaction between the number of teeth and apoE4 and, therefore, did not create apoE4 subgroups. Of the 144 participants in our study, 15 were living and 129 were deceased. Neuropathologic examination results were available for 118 of the deceased participants. In this subset, adjusting for age, education and presence of apoE4, we found no association between the number of teeth and the severity of Alzheimer neuropathology, Braak stage (OR = 1.1, 95 percent CI = [0.49-2.7], P = .75) and no association between number of teeth and brain infarcts (OR = 1.14, 95 percent CI = [0.49-2.66], P = .76). DISCUSSION Only a few studies 17-19 have explored a potential link between oral disease and the subsequent risk of developing dementia. Data from two case-control studies suggest that tooth loss may be a significant risk factor for Alzheimer disease.17,19 In our prospective longitudinal study, we found an association between the presence of a low number of teeth and the prevalence and incidence of dementia. Thirty-two of the 144 participants in our study had dementia at the first cognitive examination in the Nun Study. (Eleven participants did not have more than one cognitive examination.) We do not know how long these sisters had had
dementia. They may have had dementia when some of their teeth were extracted, in which case the dentist may have thought it was easier to extract than to restore their teeth. However, we excluded from our incidence analysis the participants who had dementia at the first examination and followed only those participants who did not have dementia at the first examination. Of the participants who did not have dementia at the first examination, those with few teeth (zero to nine) had an increased risk of developing dementia during the study compared with those who had 10 or more teeth. It is interesting that we found this increase in risk only in those without apoE4. Additionally, in participants without apoE4, a low number of teeth (one to nine) significantly increased the risk of having dementia at the first cognitive examination (OR = 6.4) compared with participants in the reference group, who had 17 to 28 teeth. This increase in odds did not occur in the participants with apoE4. Perhaps apoE4 is
such a strong risk factor for Alzheimer disease that it significantly modifies the association between tooth number and dementia. We assessed damage to alveolar bone from periodontal disease and other conditions of an inflammatory nature to investigate the potential role of inflammation in our findings. Inflammation has been suggested as playing a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease.69 Chronic “trickling” of periodontal pathogens into the systemic bloodstream may result in a sustained elevation of inflammatory products within the circulation.21 In addition, inflammatory cytokines
produced in the periodontal tissues may disseminate into the bloodstream.70-72 The potential role of cytokines in neurological changes relating to psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer disease, has been highlighted in the literature.73 The presence of interleukin-6, a cytokine significantly elevated in severe periodontal disease,28 has been demonstrated in and around senile plaques.74 This cytokine may regulate the production of beta-amyloid protein found in senile plaques.75 Interleukin-1 (IL-1), another cytokine associated with periodontal disease,76 also has been implicated in Alzheimer pathogenesis.77 Furthermore, several studies have linked polymorphisms (variations) in the IL-1 gene family to periodontal disease 78-85 and Alzheimer disease.86-89 Although these polymorphisms are found at different loci, one might consider the possibility that these polymorphisms reflect a hyperinflammatory genotype that could be an underlying trait common to people with periodontal disease and people with dementia. Although not statistically significant, the adjustment for one or more inflammatory diseases increased the odds of dementia at the first cognitive examination in those with few teeth (one to nine) from OR = 6.4 to OR = 8.2. However, we found no significant association between dementia and a history of periodontal disease, as marked by alveolar bone loss. Moderate-to-severe periodontal damage to the alveolar bone was not a significant predictor of dementia, nor was it related to Alzheimer disease or brain infarcts. Documenting the amount of alveolar bone loss from full-mouth radiographs does not present a comprehensive evaluation of the true periodontal disease burden of the participants. It only provides information about their history of periodontal disease. Full-mouth radiographs were not available for all participants; the final radiographic sample included 76 participants. Limitations of radiographic analysis have been described previously 90 and include variability of technique including angulation and patient positioning, variations in opacity and contrast, differences in film speed and processing and masking of alveolar bone by other anatomical structures. Periodontal data, therefore, must be interpreted with caution. Further studies are necessary for a more comprehensive investigation of the potential role of periodontal disease in the association between tooth loss and dementia. Besides periodontal disease, there are other possible explanations for the observed association between number of teeth and dementia in our study. Because the brain is undergoing final maturation in childhood, adolescence and even young adulthood, oral diseases in early life might be particularly damaging to the brain. One must consider the cumulative burden of all oral infections throughout the participant’s lifetime, both odontogenic and periodontal. Alternatively, the association may be due to some unmeasured or unobserved confounding factor. For example, tooth loss could be marking early life stressors and low socioeconomic status, which may have played a role in development of dementia in late life. Nutritional deficiencies, infections or chronic diseases in early life may result simultaneously in tooth loss and damage to the brain. Although unmeasured confounding is a potential limitation of any observational study, our unique study population minimized many confounding factors. Our sample was composed of a relatively highly educated population of primarily teachers, living in similar housing, who did not smoke, who did not drink heavily, and who had the same marital and reproductive history, similar medical and nursing care, and dental care from the same dentist for an average of 21 years. CONCLUSION Regardless of the issues of confounding and biological mechanisms, our findings suggest that a low number of teeth has an association with dementia late in life. However, one should not ascribe causality on the basis of the findings of this investigation. It is not clear from our findings whether the association is causal or casual. Further studies are necessary to determine the true nature of the association between tooth loss and dementia.",-,"1. Chalmers JM, Carter KD, Spencer AJ.

"Dentition, Dental Health Habits, and Dementia: The Leisure World Cohort Study","Annlia Paganini-Hill, PhD, Stuart C. White, DDS, PhD, and Kathryn A. Atchison, DDS, MPH","OBJECTIVES: To explore the association between dentition and dental health behaviors and incident dementia. DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort. SETTING: Leisure World, Laguna Hills, CA; a retirement community. PARTICIPANTS: Five thousand four hundred sixty-eight older (median age 81) adults followed from 1992 to 2010. MEASUREMENTS: Questions regarding dental health focused on number of natural teeth, dentures worn, number of visits to a dentist, and oral health habits. Dementia status was determined from in-person evaluations, follow-up questionnaires, hospital data, and death certificates. Estimates of dementia risk were calculated using Cox regression analysis in men and women separately. RESULTS: Men with inadequate natural masticatory function who did not wear dentures had a 91% greater risk of dementia than those with adequate natural masticatory function (>10 upper teeth and >6 lower teeth). This risk was also greater in women but not significantly so. Dentate individuals who reported not brushing their teeth daily had a 22% to 65% greater risk of dementia than those who brushed three times daily. CONCLUSION: In addition to helping maintain natural, healthy, functional teeth, oral health behaviors are associated with lower risk of dementia in older adults. Key words: dementia; dental health practices; teeth;elderly; epidemiology","Although interest in the effect of oral health on the general health of elderly people is growing, most geriatric dental and dementia research has been cross-sectional and focused on the assessment of oral health status in demented, cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals. With increasing severity of cognitive impairment and dementia, individuals have fewer teeth, more dental caries, more periodontal disease, more denture-related problems, less use of dentures, and poorer oral hygiene; they require more assistance with oral hygiene, and caregivers have more difficulties providing this care.1–4 However, the association between oral health and dementia may be bidirectional; poor dental health may be a risk factor for as well as a consequence of cognitive impairment. Dental health may have a role in the etiology of cognitive decline and dementia through nutritional status, infection and inflammation, or other routes.5 Few investigators have prospectively evaluated oral health and subsequent development of cognitive impairment and dementia.6–10 The focus of the present study was to examine the possible role not only of dentition status, especially the number of natural teeth and use of dentures, but also of dental health habits as predictors of dementia in elderly men and women. It was hypothesized that more teeth and better preventive dental health behaviors would be related to lower risk of dementia. The results in a large cohort (>5,000) of elderly (median age 81) men and women followed for up to 18 years are reported. METHODS The Leisure World Cohort Study was established in the early 1980s, when 13,978 residents of a California retirement community (Leisure World Laguna Hills) completed a postal health survey. Residents were recruited in four waves: those who owned homes in Leisure World on June 1, 1981, and new residents who had moved into the community and were living there on June 1, 1982; June 1, 1983; and October 1, 1985. The population and the cohort are mostly Caucasian, well-educated, upper-middle class, and elderly. Follow-up of the cohort is maintained by periodic resurvey (1983, 1985, 1992, 1998), review of local hospital discharge data (1981–2001), and determination of vital status by search of governmental and commercial death indexes and ascertainment of death certificates. Thirty-seven cohort members have been lost to follow-up. Dental Health Status and Behaviors A follow-up survey was mailed to the 8,403 cohort members still alive on November 1, 1992. Questions regarding dental health focused on the number of natural teeth, dentures worn, number of visits to a dentist, and oral health habits. Participants were asked to indicate how often they brushed their teeth in the morning, brushed their teeth at night before bed, brushed their teeth during the day, cleaned their dentures, used dental floss, used mouth wash, and used a toothpick, with response categories of every day, sometimes, and never. Sixteen teeth have been suggested as the lowest acceptable number of natural teeth in persons aged 60 and older for adequate masticatory function.11 This categorization was used, with the additional division of 16 or more teeth into 16 to 25 and 26 or more teeth. This was further refined to 10 teeth in the upper jaw and six in the lower jaw.12 This latter criterion was used to classify participants into two groups: those with or without adequate natural dentition. Those without adequate natural dentition were further categorized as wearing dentures or not. Dementia Risk Factors The follow-up survey also asked about several known risk factors for dementia. Participants were asked the highest level of education completed, with response choices of did not complete eighth grade, some high school, high school graduate, vocational school, some college, some graduate school, and advanced degree. They were asked whether they had ever seen a doctor for head injury and whether a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) had Alzheimer’s disease, senility, or dementia. Lifestyle Factors and Disease History Information on lifestyle factors and disease history came from the original health survey completed in the early 1980s. This baseline survey asked demographic information, brief medical history, medication use, and personal habits, including cigarette smoking, exercise, alcohol consumption, and beverage intake. Based on their reported smoking history, participants were classified as never, past, or current smokers.13 Information about consumption of alcoholic beverages was asked separately for wine (4 oz), beer (12 oz), and hard liquor (1 oz), each equivalent to approximately 0.5 oz of alcohol. Response choices for average weekday consumption were never drink, less than one, one, two, three, and four or more drinks. Total alcohol intake per day was calculated by summing the number of drinks consumed of each type.14 Individuals were then categorized into four groups (0, 1, 2–3, and 4 drinks/d). Daily caffeine intake was estimated by summing the frequency of consumption of each beverage and chocolate multiplied by its average caffeine content (mg/standard unit) as 115 mg for regular coffee, 3 mg for decaffeinated coffee, 50 mg for tea, 50 mg for cola soft drinks, and 6 mg for chocolate.15 Caffeine intake was categorized as <50, 50–99, 100–199, 200–399, 400 or more mg/d. The amount of time spent on physical activities was ascertained by asking the amount of time spent in active and other (less physically demanding) activities. Activities were categorized as 0, 0.5 or less, 0.75–1, and 2 or more h/d for active activities and <2, 2–3, 4–5, and 6 or more h/d for other activities.16 Body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) was calculated based on self-reported height and weight at baseline and categorized according to federal guidelines: underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2), and obese ( 30.0 kg/m2).17,18 History of hypertension, angina pectoris, heart attack, stroke, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer was determined according to a positive response to the question “Has a doctor ever told you that you had any of these conditions?” Determination of Outcome Dementia cases were identified from follow-up questionnaires, hospital records, death certificates, and in-person evaluations as part of a dementia study,19 with the date of diagnosis being the date at which dementia was first mentioned. The subset of participants in the dementia study were asked to undergo an in-person evaluation including a neurological examination (with mental status testing and assessment of functional abilities) and a neuropsychological test battery that included the Mini-Mental State Examination.20 For participants in the dementia study whose poor health, frailty, or disability did not allow for an in-person evaluation, information was obtained from the participant in a telephone interview and included the short version of the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument 21 or from an informant and included the Dementia Questionnaire.22 All cohort members were followed to dementia diagnosis, death, or December 31, 2010, whichever came first. Statistical Analysis Chi-square tests were used for comparison of categorical variables and t-tests for testing differences in means of continuous variables. Hazard ratios (HRs) of dementia associated with oral health were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with age at study entry being the age when the 1992 follow-up survey was completed and the event of interest being age at dementia. Because women differ from men on many of the dental and potential confounding variables and women live longer on average than men and for comparison with other studies limited to one sex, separate analyses were performed for men and women. HRs were calculated for dental status and each dental health behavior adjusted for age (continuous), lifestyle factors, disease and head injury history, education, and family history of dementia. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). No adjustment in P-values was made for multiple comparisons. Previous reports present details of the methods and validity of exposure and outcome data.14–17,23,24 The institutional review boards of the University of Southern California and the University of California at Los Angeles approved the study. RESULTS Of the 8,403 cohort members sent the 1992 survey, 6,173 returned the survey, 184 were too ill to participate, 388 died within the year without completing the form, and 1,658 did not respond or refused. After excluding 173 individuals who had dementia when the information on number of teeth was collected, 397 who did not report their number of teeth or information on all dental habits, and 135 with missing information on potential confounders, data were analyzed on 5,468 participants (3,735 women and 1,733 men; Figure 1). At study entry, participants ranged in age from 52 to 105 (median 81), and 72% had some education beyond high school. The median number of teeth in cohort members was 24 (range 0–32, mean 20), and nearly half had dentures (partial or full). Men tended to have fewer teeth than women (median 22 vs 24) and a greater frequency of denture use. Only 11% of the cohort was edentulous. Thirty-seven percent had inadequate natural masticatory function (<10 teeth on the maxilla or <6 teeth on the mandible). Five percent of the sample reported having had a head injury and 11% a family history of dementia. By December 31, 2010, 1,145 participants had been diagnosed with dementia. Age at dementia diagnosis ranged from 67 to 104 (median 91). Individuals with dementia were identified from the dementia study (n = 519), hospital records (n = 46), death certificates (n = 490), and follow-up questionnaires (n = 90). Table 1 shows the multivariate-adjusted risk of incident dementia according to number of teeth, inadequate natural masticatory function, and use of dentures for women and men separately. Although 90% of participants with inadequate natural masticatory function wore some dentures, those that did not had higher risk of incident dementia than those with adequate natural masticatory function ( 10 upper teeth and 6 lower teeth). The risk was statistically significant in men (HR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.13–3.21) but not in women (HR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.86–1.73). Table 2 shows the HRs for the dental health behaviors of individuals with teeth and with dentures. For dentate individuals, those who reported not brushing their teeth daily had a 22% to 65% greater risk of dementia than those who brushed three times daily—in the morning, during the day, and at night. The risk was statistically significant only in women. Using dental floss, mouth wash, or a toothpick had little effect on risk. Dementia risk was 89% greater in men who had not seen their dentist within the last 12 months than in those who had seen their dentist two or more times. For denture wearers, cleaning dentures was not significantly related to dementia risk. DISCUSSION This study extends the available literature on the benefits of adequate dentition, use of dentures in those without adequate natural masticatory function, and daily tooth brushing. Each of these was associated with lower incidence of dementia in elderly men and women. The associations between dementia and number of teeth and dental health behaviors were largely independent of other lifestyle practices, history of common chronic diseases of older adults, and known risk factors for dementia (education, head injury, family history). Although lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol and caffeine consumption play important roles in dental health, the HRs adjusted for these and other confounders were similar to those adjusted for age only. This study has several limitations. All variables used in the analyses are self-reported; no dental examinations were performed. Tooth count and oral behaviors rather than oral health were measured. Although tooth count is a component of oral health, oral health also includes periodontal and pulpal disease. Good oral behaviors probably minimize both conditions. Nonetheless, previous studies in this population and others support the reliability of self-reported number of teeth,8 health practices and drug usage,23 medical history of major chronic disease,23,24 and height and weight.23 Although changes over time in all potential risk factors may affect outcome, dental health habits are, like all habits, routines of behavior that are repeated regularly and become customary. Although adjustment was made for several known risk factors for dementia (education, head injury and family history), information was not available on apolipoprotein E4 status. In addition, the proportion of individuals with dementia was undoubtedly an underestimate of the true incidence, and clinical diagnoses of dementia based on standard criteria were lacking for many participants. Participants with dementia who had not been seen in person or hospitalized and were not reported as having dementia at the time of the follow-up surveys or on their death certificates were misclassified into the group without dementia, which in all likelihood weakened the association between oral health and dementia seen here. For these reasons, these results are preliminary and incomplete. Furthermore, the participants were from a select population—moderately affluent, highly educated, health conscious, and primarily Caucasian. Although this may limit the generalizability of the results, it reduces potential confounding by race, education, socioeconomic status, and presumed access to health care. Nonetheless, unrecognized and uncontrolled confounders cannot be excluded in this or any observational study. Only a few studies have explored the possible association between oral health and risk of developing dementia (Table 3).6–10 Generally, the fewer the number of teeth, the higher the risk. Two case–control studies suggest that tooth loss may be a significant risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).6,8 In a study of 60 Japanese with AD and their age- and sex-matched controls, loss of teeth before age 50 to 60 was a significant risk factor.6 Case-control data from the Hypertension Analysis of Stress Reduction Using Mindfulness Meditation and Yoga Study, including members of the Swedish Twin Registry aged 65 and older, showed that tooth loss before age 35 was a significant risk factor for AD but not for other dementias.8 The age- and sex-adjusted risk of having lost half or more of one’s teeth by age 35 was 1.88; further adjustment attenuated the risk to 1.68, still highly significant. No data were available in the current study on time of tooth loss, and therefore the possibility of early tooth loss being associated with higher risk of dementia can be neither excluded nor supported. In a cross-sectional analysis nested within a prospective study of community-dwelling elderly residents of South Korea, 686 residents aged 65 and older without dementia were followed for 2.4 years, and dementia status and number of teeth were ascertained at follow-up.10 Fewer teeth were associated with dementia, most strongly in those without dentures (HR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.06–2.51 adjusted for age, sex, and education). This was similar to the 1.91 risk observed in the current study in men without adequate natural masticatory function and no dentures. A Longitudinal study from Japan found that 156 of 517 participants who had no mental impairment at baseline developed some cognitive disability or dementia during the 6-year follow-up.7 The risk of mental impairment was higher in those with worse dentition. In participants who had fewer teeth or were edentulous, the incidence was higher in those not using dentures than in those using dentures, as found in the current study. Although the crude risks were statistically significant, adjustment for other significant factors (age, physical health status, type of residence, and cerebrovascular disease) attenuated the risks, and they were no longer statistically significant. Another longitudinal study used dental records of 101 Milwaukee participants of the Nun Study without dementia and found that a low number of teeth increased the risk of dementia (HR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.1–4.5 for participants with 0–9 teeth vs those with 10–28 teeth) during the subsequent 12 years of observation.9 Although the participants in the Nun Study were, like the participants in the current study, highly educated, no information was provided on use of dentures. Wearing of dentures may have a beneficial effect on mastication in those who have lost teeth and appears to be beneficial in terms of dementia risk. The current study and two previous studies 7,10 found higher risks of dementia in those not using dentures. In individuals with inadequate masticatory function in the current study, risk was 22% to 91% higher in those not using dentures; in the Asian studies, the risk was approximately 40% higher. Although cross-sectional studies have shown that dental health behaviors are related to cognitive ability, the authors know of no longitudinal study that has examined dental health practices as potential risk factors for dementia. The current study found that reports of not brushing one’s teeth every day were related to dementia risk, as were reports of not visiting the dentist within the past 12 months. Although conscientiousness and other personality traits play a role in health-related behaviors, only select oral health practices (tooth brushing but not using dental floss, mouth wash, or a toothpick) were related to dementia in dentate individuals. In addition, adjustment for other lifestyle factors (smoking, exercise, body mass index) that are probably related to a general attitude of good self-care did not appreciably change the risks of dementia observed for tooth brushing. Nonetheless, it is plausible that an individual’s poor oral health behaviors may be early signs of dementia. It is also possible that tooth brushing, with its close association with the immediate outcome of gingivitis, with its inflammatory role, may be an earlier indicator of dementia risk. Although significant effects of tooth brushing were observed only in women, the smaller number of men, with a smaller proportion identified as developing dementia, reduced the power to find a significant result. Because the 0 category for number of dental visits within the last 12 months can encompass a wide range of time since last visit, it may be that the larger risk observed in men than women is the result of men with longer elapsed times. One interesting report showed that oral care influences cognitive function in individuals with dementia randomly assigned to receive oral care or not.25 In the oral care group (n = 90), nurses or caregivers cleaned participants’ teeth with a toothbrush for approximately 5 minutes after each meal, and professional care, such as plaque and calculus control, was administered as necessary once a week. In the group that did not receive oral care (n = 99), several participants brushed their own teeth or asked the caregiver to do so. In both groups, dentures were cleaned with a brush daily and with a denture cleanser weekly. Difference in Mini-Mental State Examination score from baseline declined in both groups over 12 months, but the decline was significantly greater in the group that did not receive oral care. Potential mechanisms for a role of oral health in development of dementia include infection and inflammation, lower extracellular acetylcholine release, and nutrition.26–32 Periodontal pathogens can produce chronic systemic inflammation 26 and neuropathology. A previous study found that brains of individuals with AD were more likely to have Treponema bacteria and to have more species of it than brains of controls and that the spread of oral bacteria to the brain was probably through the trigeminal nerves.27 Inflammatory responses associated with periodontal disease have been implicated as risk factors for dementia and dementia progression.28 Periodontal disease and tooth loss have been associated with arteriosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke,5 which are in turn risk factors for dementia. Several investigators 31,32 have synthesized these findings into a potential model of proposed mechanism: direct effects of infectious oral pathogens on the brain, inflammatory response due to these pathogens, and the effects on brain vascularity. One additional, unmentioned mechanism may be that host susceptibility to inflammatory conditions may predispose the individual to dental disease and dementia. The current study had no data on periodontal disease, and the proxy variable tooth loss may occur for a variety of other reasons, including caries, service use, and professional treatment decisions and may be a weak marker of periodontal disease. The stronger associations between cognitive function and direct measures of periodontal disease than with number of teeth observed in a cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data suggest this.33 Particularly relevant to the finding that individuals without adequate masticatory function not using dentures had the highest risk of dementia is the finding of spatial memory impairment and lower extracellular acetylcholine release in toothless rats than in control elderly rats.29 The investigators suggest that tooth loss may induce the functional deterioration of the cholinergic neuronal system and that loss of teeth may be a risk factor for dementia. Dietary changes and nutritional status with respect to tooth loss and denture use may also represent links with cognitive impairment or dementia due to general or specific nutritional deficiency states.30 Although not establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between incident dementia and dental status and behaviors, these findings suggest that the association between oral health and dementia may be bidirectional. Future longitudinal studies need to explore further the causal relationship between oral health and cognitive impairment. If confirmed, then retaining adequate masticatory function through regular oral hygiene and use of dentures may reduce risk of dementia. In addition, early detection of deteriorating oral health could affect the identification of individuals at high risk of cognitive decline and lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSION Results in this large elderly cohort showing a lower risk of dementia with adequate masticatory function and regular tooth brushing suggest that good oral hygiene and health are important factors associated with the mental health of older adults.

The relationship between oral health status and Body Mass Index among older people: national survey of older people in Great Britain,"A. Sheiham, J.G. Steele, W. Marcenes, S. Finch and A.W.G. Walls","Aims To assess the relationship between oral health status and Body Mass Index.Material and methods This paper relates to the free-living sample(participants who lived in their own home, rather than an institution) of the National Diet and Nutrition Survey: people aged 65 years and older.Subjects 629 adults.Data collection probability random national sample of adults who had a dental examination, an interview and an anthropometric examination.Data analysis Fisher’s exact test and multivariate logistic modeling.Findings Being underweight was relatively uncommon in this population.People without teeth were significantly (P=0.05) more likely to be underweight than those with 11 or more teeth; 12.3% and 2.9%. A highly statistically significant (P=0.001) difference was observed in BMI between dentate people with 1-10 teeth and with more than 10 teeth; 24% and 2.9% were underweight. Dentate people with less than 21 natural teeth were on average more than 3 times more likely to be obese than those with 21-32 teeth (P=0.036). There was no significant difference in both the proportion of overweight and obese adults between those who were edentulous and dentate with 21 or more teeth. A similar pattern was observed when the number of posterior occluding pairs was compared with BMI categories. Results of multiple logistic regression were adjusted for the confounding effects of age, social class, region of origin and partial denture wearing.Conclusions Older people in Britain with more than 20 teeth are more likely to have a normal Body Mass Index.","Dental status can affect diet, nutrition and health by changes inthe types of food eaten.1-3 Tooth loss has been associated with changes in food preference and nutritional deficiency.4,5The evidence that people whose mastication is impaired by tooth loss are more likely to be underweight is conflicting. In the 1967–1968 HSS6 study of elderly people in Britain, Berry found that inefficient mastication was associated with being underweight and leanness. They also had 20% less energy intake. Further evidence for an association between edentulousness and undernutrition comes from the British DHSS survey 6 of nutrition and health in old age. Conversely, differences in body weight by dental status were not found by Elwood and Bates.7Halling, Bengtsson and Arvidsson,8 on the other hand, found that body weight was higher in edentulous people and in those with 1–15 teeth compared with those with more than 15 teeth. A similar trend was reported by Nowjack-Raymer In a large national survey in the USA.Overall it appears that edentulousness and chewing problems are related to being underweight,10-12 but the true relationship is far from clear. Whilst relationships between dental state, chewing ability and food choice have been explored, these studies often suffer from being small scale, non-representative or insufficiently rigorous in the collection of nutritional data. There are only very limited data linking nutrition or general health with dental state.From the point of view both of public health and of individual healthcare it is important to understand any relationship between dental state and body weight if either are to be managed appropriately in the elderly.This study aims to clarify the relationship between dental status and Body Mass Index (BMI), using data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey of people 65 years and older. MATERIALS AND METHODS The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) included two independent random samples of free-living and institutionalised adults aged 65 and over living in Great Britain. This paper relates to the free-living sample; participants who lived in their own home,rather than an institution.The free-living sample was selected using a multistage random probability design. Households containing eligible adults were identified from the returns and a sample of individuals was selected using probabilities required to produce the target sample sizes.Institutions were excluded. Full details of the sampling procedures and the response rate are published elsewhere.2,13The oral health survey of people participating in the NDNS was carried out to relate their oral health to their dietary intake and nutritional status; it included an oral examination and an oral health interview.2 Trained and calibrated dentists undertook the oral examinations, whilst trained interviewers conducted the oral health questionnaire. Two measures of oral health were derived to give an indication of the potential masticatory efficiency. They Were the number of natural teeth and the number of posterior occluding pairs of teeth (POPs). The relationship between mechanical efficiency and the numbers of natural teeth and their distribution has been well established for many years,14 though the impact of a partial denture on mechanical function is less clear.The dietary survey collected detailed information about the quantities of foods and nutrients consumed by the sample of elderly people as well as demographic data, anthropometric measurements and measurements of the levels of certain nutrients in blood and urine. To measure body fatness, height and weight, measurements were used to derive the Quetelet or Body Mass Index, a ratio between the weight in kilograms and the height in metres squared(weight[kg]/height[m]2. Height was measured with a portable, digital telescopic stadiometer with participants without shoes and head horizontal in the Frankfurt Plane. Weight was measured to the nearest 100 grams using Soehnle Quantratonic digital personal scales on a hard, level surface.13A ratio of 20 to 25 was considered as ‘normal’, while less than this defined underweight, values between 25 and 30 were defined as being overweight, and values of 30 or over were considered obese. Whilst these divisions are essentially arbitrary, they are widely used.14 Data analysis Data analysis included descriptive and analytic statistics. Statistical significance was set at the 5% level. Multivariate logistic modeling was used to make allowance for the potential confounding effects of age, sex, social class, region of origin and partial denture wearing during the assessment of the relationships tested. Due to the low prevalence of underweight elderly people (n=24, Table 2), adjusted odds ratios could not be estimated using multivariate logistic modeling for this group, and Fisher’s exact test was used. Since there was no difference between those with 11–20 and 21–32 teeth (2.9% were underweight in both groups) these categories were combined for analysis of dataon low body weight. Separate analyses were conducted to compare edentulous people with those with 11–32 teeth and to compare those with 1–10 teeth with the same groups. A similar approach was adopted when the relationship between number of POOPs and BMI was analysed. The categories 1–4 and 5 or more were combined and separate analyses were conducted to compare with those dentate people with zero POPs and the edentulous. This was necessary because Fisher’s exact test applies only to a two by two table.RESULTS Complete data were available for 629 people. The frequency distribution of demographic variables is presented in Table 1. A total of 346 (55%) participants were dentate and 283 (45%) were edentulous (Table 2).A scatterplot of number of teeth against BMI showed that the relationship was not linear. BMI data were categorized into underweight (BMI<20), overweight (25-30) and obese (>30) and were compared with ‘normal’ (20-25). The majority of the sample had a BMI greater than 25; 47.4% were overweight and 18.9% were obese. Few people were underweight (3.8%), and 29.9% were in the‘normal’ category. The frequency distribution of BMI categories was similar in dentate and edentulous people (Table 2).The results of Fisher’s exact test to evaluate the relationship between being underweight and dental status showed that people without teeth were significantly (P=0.05) more likely to be underweight than those with 11 or more teeth, 12.3% and 2.9% respec-tively (Table 3). There was also a highly statistically significant(P=0.001) difference in BMI between dentate people with 1–10 teeth and those with more than 10 teeth; 24% and 2.9% were underweight respectively (Table 3). The results of multiple logistic regression demonstrated that dentate people with less than 21 natural teeth were on average more than three times more likely to be obese than those with 21–32 teeth (P=0.036, Table 3). There was no statistical difference in both the proportion of overweight and obese adults between those who were edentulous and dentate with 21 or more teeth. A similar pattern was observed when the POPs measure of oral health was used (Table 4). All results of multiple logistic regression were adjusted for the confounding effects of age, social class, region of origin and partial denture wearing.DISCUSSION This research reports data on a carefully drawn national probability sample. Validated measures were used, data collection was rigorous, and data analysis took into account the confounding effect of age, social class, region of origin and partial denture wearing during the assessment of the relationships tested. The analysis was deliberately restricted to the relationship between BMI and the presence and number of natural teeth. The functional benefits and wearing habits of complete dentures are variable and difficult to quantify, particularly in the absence of a reasonable population of‘non-wearers’. All but a very small number of individuals without any natural teeth in one or both arches had complete dentures and wore them for some part of the day. The presence of partial dentures in those with some natural teeth was included as a co-variable in the model so that the impact of partial dentures could be accounted for when evaluating the relationship between BMI and the number of natural teeth. The results of this study showed that having a functioning natural dentition, defined as having more than 20 teeth,increased the likelihood of having a ‘normal’ BMI (20-25).Amongst adults over 65 years, having few natural teeth or none at all was associated with a greater risk both of being underweight and with a greater risk of being obese. The approach used in this study tested the relationship between oral health measures and four categories of BMI, underweight, ‘normal’, overweight and obese, as it was clear that the association between number of teeth and BMI was not linear. This differs from other studies that assumed a linear association between oral health measures and relative body weight. To assume linearity may cancel or mask the true association, or alternatively, may show a weak association in either direction. Existing evidence relating edentulousness,and having few teeth, to being underweight,10-12 overweight 8 or unrelated to weight appear to be contradictory.These findings may not explain the apparent contradictions.Interestingly, there was not a statistically significant difference in BMI between edentulous people and dentate adults having a functioning dentition of more than 20 teeth. The insufficient masticators identified in this study were those with less than 21 teeth without replacement. This explains the lack of significant association between dental status and BMI reported in Table 2. Numbers of teeth may not be an adequate measure of masticatory function. Having premolar and molar teeth which occlude are relevant to. This study tested relationship between BMI and number of occluding posterior pairs, and the results followed the same pattern observed when the number of teeth were used as a measure of oral health (Table 4).The nature of the relationship between BMI and oral health is clearly rather complex. A low BMI is easily explainable on the basis of there being real functional difficulties that can prevent normal eating in some cases. On the other hand, the association of poor oral health with obesity is likely to be associated with the quality of the diet. There may even be an argument that the loss of teeth may have been the result of a poor quality diet in some instances. Interestingly, the strongest associations between BMI(both being underweight and obese) were where people had some teeth, but were not edentulous. It can be more difficult to provide adequate function, and therefore to provide for an adequate and varied diet, where there are a few poorly distributed teeth than where there are none at all. This is a problem particularly where the teeth are in only the upper arch. Whilst this does not always hold true it may partly explain the relationships observed.The findings of this study have important implications for public health policy. Previous analyses of these data have shown that people with fewer than 20 teeth had dietary restrictions s3and nutritional deficiency when compared with those with 20 or more teeth. The findings reported here provide further scientific evidence for 20 or more natural teeth being a reasonable threshold for acceptable oral health and a functional dentition into old age.16-18 In conclusion, maintaining a healthy and functional dentition into old age may have an important additional role to play in maintaining a healthy Body Mass Index.",-,"1.Posner B M, Jette A, Smigelski C, Miller D, Mitchell P.

Association between underweight and overweight/obesity with oral health among independently living Brazilian elderly,"Torres Luısa Helena do Nascimento M.S., Silva Debora Dias da Ph.D., Neri Anita Liberalesso Ph.D., Hilgert Juliana Balbinot Ph.D., Hugo Fernando Neves Ph.D., Sousa Maria da Luz Rosario de Ph.D.,","Objective:Poor oral status, represented by partial/complete tooth loss, may lead to changes in foodchoice, which may ultimately lead to underweight, overweight, or obesity. The aim of this study isto evaluate whether poor oral status is associated with underweight or overweight/obesity,regardless of physical activity.Methods:This cross-sectional study is part of a major project, The Frailty in Brazilian Elderly Study,carried out in Campinas, Brazil (2008–2009). The sample was composed of 900 independent-livingolder adults. Complete data were available for 875 individuals including sociodemographic, self-reported amount of medications used and eating difficulty questionnaire, smoking habit, depres-sive symptoms, physical activity, oral examination, and anthropometric assessments according tothe WHO criteria. Body mass index was used as an outcome. Multinomial logistic regression wasadjusted for confounding variables.Results:The mean age of the sample was 72.7 y (5.81) and the prevalence of edentulism was47.7%. Edentate individuals not wearing dentures were more likely to be underweight [odds ratio(OR)¼3.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14–13.64] and overweight/obese (OR¼2.88, 95%CI 1.12–7.40). Males (OR¼0.56, 95%CI 0.36–0.85) and those not using medications (OR¼0.41 95%CI 0.24–0.70) were less likely to be overweight/obese. Individuals who smoke (OR¼2.62, 95%CI 1.26–5.44)were more likely to be underweight. Older individuals with family income between 3.1 and 5minimum wage (OR¼1.69, 95%CI 1.00–2.87) were more likely to be overweight/obese.Conclusion:To our knowledge, this is one of thefirst studies associating poor oral health, repre-sented by edentulism not rehabilitated with dentures, with unfavorable body mass, regardless ofthe two major confounders, physical activity and depression symptoms. Keywords:Geriatric dentistryBody mass indexTooth lossNutritional statusExercise","Introduction The elderly population in Brazil is growing fast; by 2050 it is expected that elderly people will represent 18% of the population[1]. According to national data, less than 10% of Brazilian older individuals from 65 to 74 y old have 20 teeth or more[2].Poor oral health and poor general health are interrelated,especially among older individuals, due to common risk factors[3]. Oral health changes such as tooth loss influence the individual’s life, increasing their chance of having a poor quality of life [4]; it may also result in decreased masticatory efficiency and function[5].A minimum of 20 teeth are needed for satisfactory chewing ability and functional dentition[6]. Dental status can impact on food choice and on the intake of important nutrients[7–9]. Moreedentate individuals than dentate individuals tend to consume less than the recommendations of most nutrients[9–14] .The number of teeth, regardless of whether they are replaced or natural, may have an impact on the body mass index (BMI)[15] . Thus, oral rehabilitation with complete dentures does not necessarily imply a perfect chewing ability[16] . Denture use is associated with decreased masticatory capacity[17] . In addition,it can be a determinant of poor nutrition because older adults tend to change their eating habits as a result of the reduced masticatory efficiency[11,18–20].Furthermore, poor nutrition can possibly lead to changes in BMI. Partial or complete tooth loss not rehabilitated with dentures was associated with obesity in a population from Southern Brazil[21] . Obesity is increasing worldwide, representing not only a global outbreak[22] but also a public health problem[23] due to its association with disability, which directly affects health care costs[24]. According to some studies, there isa relationship between low physical activity, high BMI, an inadequate dietary standards[25,26]. According toTsai et al.[27] ,physical activity seems to have the potential of impacting theaging-associated anthropometric changes. Despite being a keyfactor for weight gain and obesity, the effects of physical activityhave not been well established in this relationship up untilrecently[11,21]. Although a significant number of studies haveshown that oral status, mainly partial and complete tooth loss, isassociated with BMI, there is no evidence showing if this rela-tionship keeps its significance if adjusted to physical activity.Difficulty in chewing or swallowing was associated withlower BMI among older women in the USA[19] . Significantincreased mortality risk was also associated with underweight[28]. Therefore, it is complex to study the nutritious status inolder adults because their health is a result of the interactionbetween the way they aged and lived and the habits they hadthroughout their lives.The hypothesis of the present study is that oral status, rep-resented by partial or complete tooth loss not rehabilitated withdentures, is positively associated with underweight or over-weight/obesity, regardless of confounders, including physicalactivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationshipbetween underweight and overweight/obesity and oral healthstatus using data from the FIBRA study.Materials and methodsStudy designThis cross-sectional study is part of a larger study on independent-livingolder individuals from the city of Campinas, Brazildthe“Rede FIBRA”study,The Frailty in Brazilian Elderly Study which is a multicenter and multidisciplinarystudy designed to understand better the prevalence, characteristics, and primaryfactors associated with frailty in Brazilian elderly.Aprobabilistic,clustersamplewasused,takingintoconsiderationurbancensussectors. The number of elderly individuals in Campinas was calculated as 82 560(65 y old), corresponding to 7.8% of the city’s population. Based on this number,the sample was calculated through the formula of finite population, taking into account the achievement of statistical representativeness to describe the prevalence of frailty, use and need of dental prosthesis, presence of teeth, and oral soft tissue injuries. Older individuals were invited from their homes to take part in the study. Data were collected in a single session from September 2008 to June 2009.Population and sample The inclusion criteria included the following: 65 y old or more, able to understand the instructions, and permanent resident in the home and the census sector.The exclusion criteria[29] included the following: severe cognitive impairment,temporary orpermanentinabilitytowalk,localizedstrengthlossandaphasiaduetoserious stroke, serious impairment due to Parkinson, severe communication difficulties, chemotherapy treatment, severe sensory deficit, and terminal stage cancer.Ninety of the 835 urban census sectors of Campinas were randomly selected.On average,10 elderly persons were randomly selected in each census sector. The Sample size was calculated in 900 older people living independently in the community and 875 individuals answered the data and participated in this study.Ethics This study was carried out after approval from the Research Ethics Committee involving Human Beings of the Piracicaba Dental School/University of Campinas (No. 15/2009).Measurements The purpose of the study was explained to participants before informed consent was obtained. The interview started with identification and the Mini Mental State Exam (cut off according to Brucki et al.[30]).Variables Questionnaire Socio demographic data, self-reported intake of medications, smoking habits, self-reported eating difficulties questionnaire, and depressive symptoms assessment.Socio Demographic data includes information regarding age, monthly family income, schooling, race/skin color, gender, and marital status. Socio-demographic variables and current smoking status were assessed through theapplication of an interview questionnaire. Independent variables of monthlyfamily income and age were transformed from continuous into ordinal variables.The intake of medications was assessed as the amount of medications dailytaken, prescribed or not over the last 3 mo. A summary measure of the number ofmedications was used in the analyses.Self-reported eating difficulties assessment was performed through thefollowing question: Have you had difficulties in chewing or swallowing food overthe last 12 mo?Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale(GDS), Brazilian Portuguese short version[31] . The cutoff point was5 for theabsence and>5 for the presence of symptoms.Physical activity assessment.Physical activity assessment was obtained throughself-reporting of the regular practice of physical activities (those who expendedweekly at least 150 min on exercise of moderate intensity or at least 120 min ofhigh intensity were considered active), based on recommendations of theAmerican College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), and American Heart Association[32]. The ones that expended less than that were considered sedentary. The Exercise intensity classification was according to Haskell et al.[33],who considered energy expenditure under 3 metabolic equivalents of task (METs) asmild intensity, 3-6 METs as moderate intensity, and more than 6 METs as high intensity.Sixteen Items Were used to assess physical exercise and active sports (walking,stair climbing as a way of exercise, cycling, ballroom dancing, gymnastics,stretching, yoga, tai-chi, jogging, mild or vigorous walking, working out, swimming, playing volleyball, playing soccer, and refereeing soccer games); there wasalsoanopenquestionaboutanyothertypeofexercisenotincludedinthepreviousitems.Anthropometric measuresHeight and weight were used to calculate the BMI, which is a ratio between weight in kilograms and the height in meters squared (kg/m2). Anthropometric Measures were carried out using classic protocols that required digital platescales (standardized to every data collection) and measuring tape. Participants Were classified as underweight (<23 kg/m2), eutrophic (23–27.99 kg/m2), overweight (28–29.99 kg/m2), and obese (>30 kg/m2) according to Pan American Health Organization recommendations for older individuals[34]. For analysis purposes, overweight and obese categories were considered a single category.The reference category was eutrophic.Oral examinations Number of teeth and presence of dental prosthesis.All examinations were carried out by three trained dentists and dental status was assessed by recording the number of natural teeth and the use of dental prostheses for both arches according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria[35]. Data regarding the number of natural teeth and presence of dental prostheses were used to generate a new variable named“Oral Status.”The WHO[36] recommends the presence of at least 20 teeth for function and esthetic natural dentition. Thus,participants were categorized into the following: edentulous wearing none orone complete denture, edentulous wearing upper and lower complete denture,<20 teeth without prosthesis,<20 teeth with prosthesis,20 teeth withoutprosthesis, and20 teeth with prosthesis.Statistical analysesThec2test was performed for categorical variables. To test the studyhypothesis, all independent variables that showed an association withP<0.25 inthe univariate analyses were candidates to the multivariate model[37] . Variablesthat did not contribute to the model (P>0.25) were excluded and a new modelwas developed. The old and new models were always compared using the like-lihood ratio test. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to estimatethe crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals werecalculated for the variables of interest with both categories of the BMI outcomes(underweight and overweight/obesity). Associations with BMI categories were adjusted by means of multinomiallogistic regression for sociodemographic variables, including age (65–69/70–74/75–79/80 y old), race/skin color (white/non-white), gender (male/female),marital status (married/unmarried), schooling (illiterate/8y/>8 y), monthlyfamily income [minimum wage in Reais, MW (1 MW/1.1–3 MW/3.1–5MW/>5.1MW)]. It was also adjusted for intake of medications (amount of medications inuse: 0/1–2/3), depression-GDS (yes/no), smoking habit (current smoker/not),physical activity (sedentary/active), and oral status (number of present teeth/prosthesis use, presence or absence of prosthesis), and self-reported eatingdifficulties assessed through the question,“Do you have difficulties in chewing orswallowing food?”(always/sometimes/never).All statistical analyses were carried out using the PASW Statistics softwareversion 18.ResultsThe mean age of the sample was 72.7 y (5.81) and themedian schooling was 4.0 y (75th 6 y). There were a largerpercentage of women in the sample (69.3%). The averagemonthly family income was equivalent to 2.67 (0.94) MW(approximately USD 667.50). Of the studied subjects, 53.9% (n¼306) were sedentary and 46.1% (n¼262) were considered active.Almost one-half of the participants were edentulous and, amongthose, the majority was underweight or overweight/obese.Among individuals with 20 teeth or more, the majority was inthe eutrophic category. The mean number of natural teeth was7.21 (9.13). The characteristics of the sample in relation to theBMI categories are shown inTable 1.Variables independently associated with underweight andobesity adjusted by means of multinomial logistic regression arelisted inTable 2. Smoking status, family income, depression, andphysical activity adjusted the model.DiscussionThe results of this cross-sectional study suggest that completetooth loss not rehabilitated with complete dental prostheses isassociated with both underweight and overweight/obesity inindependent-living older individuals. Many studies[6,12–14]have shown an association between number of teeth and BMI,although no previous study showed that poor oral status isassociated with compromised BMI, regardless of physical activity. The number of natural teeth may affect the ability to eat certainfoods[13] , affecting the intake of essential nutrients. Having 20teeth or more helps prevent underweight, overweight/obesityand can increase the possibility of having normal BMI values, thuscontributing to general health[6,14]. It is important to stress thatthe majority of the edentulous individuals were either under-weight or overweight/obese.Conflicting results have been reported when considering therelationship between compromised dentition, artificially restoreddentition, food selection, and nutritional status[5,38–40] .Compared to edentulism, the presence of some teeth may reflectsome changes in the eating habits and consequently a betternutrition, causing minor variations in BMI. Sheiham et al.[9]concluded that the presence of even a few natural teeth is of some value, when comparing the food intake values of dentate individuals with very few teeth with edentulous subjects.Although the presence of some teeth contributes to healthy BMI values, the replacement of lost teeth by dental prostheses could allow the recovery of the masticatory ability[40] , also showing protective effect against obesity[21] . These results are in line with ours, because edentulous individuals without dental prosthesis rehabilitation were more likely to be underweight or overweight/obese.It is known that many older individuals use inadequate dental prosthesis only for esthetic reasons and eventually remove it to eat. A significant number of these individuals may also have partial or complete tooth loss not rehabilitated by dental prostheses[16] . Both conditions may cause weight changes. Ina study conducted with independent-living elderly in Southern Brazil, obesity was associated with partial or complete tooth loss not rehabilitated with dental prostheses[21] . These Findings are in agreement with those of the present study. The authors of the former study, however, did not adjust the analysis for physical activity[11,21].Body mass is affected by several factors, which are determined not only by the number of teeth, but also by medical problems,intake of several medications, dietary habits, and socioeconomic status, which can affect the way older individuals make choices including those related to food[14,41,42]. According to the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey[43], 6% of families living in private households have an income ranging from 3.1 to 5 MW. In addition, almost 83.6% of families living in private households live with less than that. Our results show that individuals who have a family income ranging from 3.1 to 5 MW are more likely to be overweight/obese. These Findings suggest that households with intermediate family income spend more on low-quality food rich in fat and sugar. Such an assumption is confirmed by empirical data obtained in the Brazilian National Household Food Budget Survey[44] , which showed that, compared to lower family incomes, families in the mid-range income strata consume an excessive proportion of calories from total and saturated fats and sugar. This result is in accordance with Barreto Et al.[45], who reported that obesity was more common among non-poor when compared to poor individuals as a result of the combination of lipid-rich diets with reduced physical activity.Although for Griffiths and Bentley[46], what may be protecting poor individuals from obesity is physically active occupations and lack of income to purchase unhealthy foods.Many studies that evaluated the association between tooth loss and nutrition have not taken into account physical activity.Nevertheless, this study assessed this relation because physical activity is an important predictor of weight control. Physical Activity was used as a confounding variable in the studies association, but it was not significant. Similarly, Mack et al.[15] found no association between physical activity and BMI when studying Swedish elderly men. However, Barreto et al.[45] found an association between obesity and sedentarism. Okay et al.[47]wondered how much physical activity is required to be significant in weight reduction. Interestingly, sedentary and moderately active women in Canada were more likely to be obese compared with highly active ones[48] . In the present study,older individuals were categorized as active if performing both high and moderate physical activities.Comorbidities increase with the aging of populations and the intake of medications may lead to several side effects. The Importance of chronic diseases and use of drugs are due to their impact on quality of aging, health, and health care costs. In the present study, individuals who did not use any medication were less likely to be overweight/obese. Although questions such as the type of medications in use or if the participants felt any side effect when using them were not asked. Another possible consequence for the use of multiple medications could be appetite suppression, gastrointestinal upset, anorexia, nausea,and the excretion of important minerals and vitamins[5]. Individuals who do not need to take any medication can be considered healthy and their BMIs tend to range in the eutrophic category.Healthy aging is a result of the interaction between physical and mental health, social and family support, and economic independence. Depression is a common condition among the elderly mainly because it is connected to general age-related changes. One of the major consequences of this disorder is that it can lead to isolation, negligence with (oral) hygiene, and consequently the act of avoiding the preparation of foods and nutritional meals. Compared to other studies in literature,depression was not associated with BMI in this study. An Explanation for that may be the fact that depression is a complex disease with many contributing factors.Being male had a protective effect against overweight/obesity. Other studies found that being female had a significant correlation with high BMI[11,21]. According to Campos et al.[49] , a possible explanation for the higher likelihood of women being overweight or obese is the largest accumulation of visceral fat, differences in food intake, and increased life expectancy. In Addition, the authors argue that menopause is accompanied by weight gain and adiposity.Older individuals who smoke were currently more likely to be underweight, finding that is in agreement with Barreto et al.[45]. Smokers tend to be careless with their health, possibly because smokers have a less healthy diet. Among smokers who are underweight, there are fewer individuals who stop smoking due to concerns about weight gain. According to Intorre et al.[50], smoking is a modifiable risk factor for disease in older individuals and it is related to the association between underweight and mortality rate, reflecting the relationship between illness and weight loss[45].This study presents some limitations, especially considering that it is a cross-sectional study; therefore, causality cannot be inferred. A longitudinal study is needed to clarify the effect of physical activity in the relation between oral status and BMI,particularly in weight control and reduction. Although the association was evaluated between BMI and oral health, dietary intake data were not collected. This would allow the identification of the elders’dietary restrictions and food choices and would contribute to a more precise adjustment of the model. The Validity of the results could have been strengthened by the presence of this information, so this should be considered when interpreting results. Chronic diseases, such as diabetes, which is known to be related to oral status and BMI, were not evaluated.Another limitation of this study was that almost 90% (n¼610) of the population studied was considered independent in all six functions of the Activities of Daily Living, revealing the homogeneity in relation to the degree of independence of the participants.Conclusion The results of the present study suggest the need for greater interaction between health professionals, focusing on the maintenance of oral health, functional dentition, and oral rehabilitation. As a consequence of natural teeth retention, older individuals may increase nutritional food intake, aiming at healthy aging, especially within normal BMI.Acknowledgments Torres LHN was supported by Capes.This research was funded by Fapesp (2009/51455-2) and CNPq(555082-2006/7).",-,"[1] Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.

"DENTITION STATUS, MALNUTRITION AND MORTALITY AMONG OLDER SERVICE HOUSING RESIDENTS","R.K.T. SaaRela, H. Soini, K. HilTunen, S. MuuRinen, M. SuoMinen, K. PiTKala","Background: oral health status and oral health problems can affect eating habits and thus consequently
the nutritional status of frail older people. Objectives: To assess older service house residents' dentition and its
associations with nutritional status and eating habits, and as well as to explore the prognostic value of dentition
status for mortality. Design: a cross-sectional study with a three-year follow-up. Methods: in 2007, we assessed
the nutritional status of all residents in service houses in the two cities of Helsinki and espoo in Finland
(n=2188). altogether 1475 subjects (67%) participated in the study; dentition status data were available for 1369
of them. using a personal interview and assessment, trained nurses familiar to the resident collected the subjects´
demographic data, medical history, functional and cognitive status, information on dentition status, oral
symptoms, eating habits and diets. We assessed nutritional status with the Mini nutritional assessment (MNA),
and retrieved information on mortality from central registers on 6 July 2010. Results: edentulousness was
common; more than half of the residents (52%) had lost all their teeth: 7% (n=94) were totally edentulous
without prosthesis (Group 1), 45% (n=614) had removable dentures (Group 2), and 48% (n = 661) of the
residents, had some natural teeth left (Group 3). Dentition status was associated with age, gender, education and
disability. according to the MNA, 13% were malnourished, 65% were at risk for malnutrition, and 22% were
well nourished. edentulousness without prosthesis was associated with malnutrition, oral symptoms and
infrequent use of oral care services. in Group 1, 52% were deceased during follow-up period. The respective
figures for Groups 2 and 3 were 48% and 40% (p=0.004). However, in Cox regression analysis adjusted for age,
gender, comorbidity and MNA score, dentition status no longer predicted mortality. Conclusion: edentulousness
is still common among older service housing residents. edentulousness without prosthesis was associated with
poor nutritional status, oral symptoms and infrequent use of dental services. These findings suggest the need for
cooperation between nursing staff and oral care services. Key words: Dentition status, nutrition, mortality, older adults, service housing residents.","in Finland, edentulousness is still common even though oral
health has improved in past decades. a decade ago, a large and
representative national survey in Finland showed that half of
the population over 75 years of age was edentulous (1).
The relationship between oral health and nutrition is
multidirectional (2). nutritional factors play a role in the
development and prevention of oral diseases and tooth loss (2).
The state of oral health affects an older person's´ ability and
desire to eat and to maintain adequate nutritional status (3, 4).
When chewing ability declines, people choose to eat foods that
require less mastication or they process their food to make it
easier to chew (5). These changes can lead to adverse changes
in nutrient intake (6-8), diet quality (9-11), and quality of life
(12-14). Joshipura et al. (15), for example, showed that
edentulous participants consumed fewer vegetables, less fiber
and carotene, and more cholesterol, saturated fat and calories
than did participants with 25 or more teeth.
older people, especially those living in institutions, are at
special risk for malnutrition (16-17). Finnish studies based on
the Mini nutritional assessment MNA –test, which is well validated and widely used nutritional screening tool in older, frail persons, have shown that about one third of aged nursing
home residents and about half of aged long-term care hospital
patients were malnourished (18, 19). also, nutritional problems
are often poorly recognised and left untreated (19, 20). lamy et
al. (21) reported that edentulous subjects without dentures or
with only one complete denture had significantly lower MNA
scores, and consumed mashed food more frequently than did
edentulous subjects with two complete dentures in both jaws.
Soini et al. (22) showed that the number of eating problems was
significantly associated with the MNA score, and that those
with chewing and swallowing problems had lower MNA
scores. Furthermore, several studies have shown an association
between malnutrition and mortality (23-25), and between
dentition status and mortality (26-31).
in Finland service housing is provided for persons who
cannot cope with everyday life in their own homes on home
care. The residents mainly live in their own flats or in their own
room in a group homes. The nursing care is provided round a
clock and medical services are provided by primary care
physicians. little is known about dentition status and its
association with the nutritional status and mortality of residents
living in service houses. in our current study, we aimed to assess the dentition status of the older service housing residents
(≥65 years) and its associations with nutritional status and
eating habits. We also explored the prognostic value of
dentition status for mortality.Materials and methods
This research was originally a developmental project funded
by two municipalities to improve the nutritional care of older
residents in institutional care. This study comprised all service
housing residents aged 65+ years in the cities of Helsinki and
espoo in Finland (n=2188). altogether, 1475 (67%) residents
participated in the study, 1369 of them, had available dentition
status data. The rest either refused (28%) or were residents in
temporary respite care (5%). The local ethics committee of the
Helsinki university Hospital approved the study, and all
participants provided their informed consent.
Ward nurses familiar to residents interviewed and assessed
each resident. The nurses received detailed training prior
performing assessment. The structured questionnaire included
information on demographics, dentition status, oral symptoms,
medical diagnoses, functional and cognitive status, and eating
habits. Ward nurses evaluated dentition status interviewing,
observing and assessing the residents. all the residents´ active
medical diagnoses were retrieved from their medical records.
Comorbidity was computed for each resident using Charlson’s
comorbidity index (32). This index is a validated and widely
used weighted index, which take into account the seriousness
and number of resident´s comorbid diseases.
Cognitive and physical functioning were evaluated with
questions retrieved from the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale
(CDR) (33). The subject’s stage of cognition was evaluated
according to the “Memory” score in the CDR (0 = no memory
problems, 0.5 = possible memory problems, 1 = mild problems,
2 = moderate problems, or 3 = severe problems) and divided
into two groups: those with CDR < 1 and those with CDR > 1
(cognitive impairment). Their dependence in activities of daily
living (aDls) was assessed according to the CDR “personal
care” item. a CDR > 2 was defined as dependence in aDls
(requiring assistance in dressing, hygiene, managing personal
effects, or requiring significant help with personal care, often
involving incontinence). Mobility was assessed with the
question “Can the resident walk indoors?”, (yes/no).
information on 3 –year mortality was retrieved from central
registers on 6 July 2010.
The nutritional status of each resident was assessed using the
Mini nutritional assessment (MNA) (34). The MNA consist of
measurements and questions of four categories:
anthropometric measurements, general status, dietary
information and subjective assessment. Fewer than 17 points
indicates malnutrition, 17-23.5 indicates a risk for malnutrition,
and more than 23.5 points indicates good nutritional status.
Residents’ weight and height were measured and their body
mass index (BMi) was calculated by dividing a resident´s
weight by the square of his/her height in metres. The nurses
provided information about residents´ eating habits and diets.
The consistency of food was defined by three categories:
normal food, soft food, pureed or liquid food. nurses familiar
to the residents observed and evaluated the average amount of
food eaten in a normal meal compared with a model meal,
which was provided as an image for the nurses. The amount of
meal eaten by a resident was then categorised as eating
adequately (usually eating amount of a model meal) or little
(usually eating less than a model meal). The use of snacks in
the service house between meals was enquired with yes/no
questions.
oral symptoms (yes/no) were categorised as follows:
chewing problems, swallowing difficulties, pain in the mouth,
and dry mouth. The use of oral care services was assessed with
the question and the responses provided by nurses: “When was
the most recent oral examination performed by a dentist or
dental hygienist? Responses were categorised as follows: 1 =
less than one year ago, 2 = one to three years ago and 3 = more
than three years ago. Statistical analysis
We analysed the data using SPSS and nCSS statistical
programs. The residents´ dentition status was classified
according to the type of dentition: Group 1: edentulous without
dentures; Group 2: edentulous with some removable dentures in
one or both jaws (complete or partial); Group 3: all or some
natural teeth left with or without removable denture in one or
both jaws. The number of teeth was not counted. We compared
these three dentition status groups using the X2 test or Fisher's
exact test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis -test
for continuous variables. P –values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant. Cox regression analysis was used to
explore the prognostic value of dentition status on mortality.
Results shows the characteristics of participants living in
service housing according to their dentition status. of the
residents, 79% were women. The residents´ mean age was 83
years, 56% had a low level of education (i.e. primary school or
less). The residents had lived in the present service house for a
mean of 2.9 years. of the subjects, 7% (n=94) were totally
edentulous with no dentures (Group 1) and 45% (n = 614) were
edentulous, but had some kind of dentures (Group 2) (complete
dentures being the most common in this group (n=520)), and
48% (n = 661) had some natural teeth left (Group 3). Diabetes
and prior hip fracture diagnoses were significantly associated
with dentition status categories being least common among
those with natural teeth left.
according to the CDR class “Memory”, 55% of the residents
had cognitive impairment. Subjects in Group 1 more often
required assistance in personal care than those the other two
groups. The mobility of the subjects also differed according to
dentition status groups. in Group 1 17% were unable to walk at
all. The respective figure in Groups 2 and 3 was 10%. We used the chi-square test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis -test for non-normally distributed continuous variables to test for differences between the groups. SD =
standard deviation. Charlson comorbidity index (32)We used the chi-square test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis -test for non-normally distributed continuous variables to test for differences between the groups. SD =
standard deviation. The association between dentition status and nutritional
status and eating habits as well as between oral symptoms and
the use of oral care services appears in Table 2. according the
MNA, 22% of the service housing residents were well
nourished and 13% malnourished. nutritional status was
significantly associated with dentition status (p = 0.014). of the
participants in Group 1, 23% were malnourished, 63% were at
risk of malnutrition and 14% were well nourished. The
respective figures for the Group 2 were 12%, 64% and 24%. in
the Group 3 12% of the participants were malnourished, 65% at risk of malnutrition and 22% were well nourished.
Most of the residents were able to eat normal food. Dentition
status categories were significantly associated with the
consistency of food offered. Puréed or soft food was most
common in Group 1. of the subjects, 76% ate a normal amount
of their food at meals. according to nurses´ evaluation totally
edentulous residents (Group 1) on average ate adequately from
the main meals more often than did other groups. Group 1
suffered from chewing problems and swallowing difficulties
more often than Groups 2 and 3. Subjects in group 1 had more often oral symptoms, but used oral care services less frequently
than did those in Groups 2 and 3.
of the residents, 44% were deceased during the three-year
follow-up. of the subjects in Group 1, more than half (52%)
were deceased; the respective figure in Group 2 was 48% and
in Group 3 40% (P = 0.004). in the Cox regression analysis
adjusted for age, gender, comorbidity and MNA score,
dentition status no longer predicted mortality (Group 1: HR
1.19 (95%Ci 0.87 to 1.63) and Group 2: HR 1.15 (95%Ci 0.97
to 1.37) when Group 3 is used as the references group (HR 1.0).
The findings were essentially the same when the analysis was
repeated without MNA score (Group 1: HR 1.29 (95%Ci 0.95
to 1.77) and Group 2: HR 1.13 (95%Ci 0.96 to 1.34). Discussion according to our findings edentulousness is still common
among Finnish elderly residents living in service housing: more
than half of the residents had lost all their teeth and 7% were
edentulous without dentures. edentulousness was associated
with higher age, lower education, diabetes, disability, poor
nutritional status, reported oral symptoms and poorer use of
dental services. Mortality was higher among edentulous
residents without dentures, but when adjusting for age, gender,
comorbidity and MNA, dentition status lost its predictive value
for mortality.
The strength of our study is its large and representative
sample of residents living in service housing in metropolitan
area of Finland. The study population consisted of all residents
residing in service housing in the cities of espoo and Helsinki,
67% of whom participated in the study. Well-trained nurses
collected the data on demographic factors; functional,
nutritional and dentition status; as well as other study
information. information on medical diagnoses was obtained
from medical records, which support the validity of data. in
addition, nutritional status was measured with the MNA test
(34), which is a simple, well-validated instrument developed
especially for assessing the nutritional status of aged
individuals.
one limitation of our study is its cross-sectional design,
which makes it impossible to draw causal relationships between
dentition status and nutrition. an additional limitation of this
study is that the number of teeth was not counted. Therefore,
the group 3, with some natural teeth remaining, and with or
without dentures to support their occlusal status, can be a
heterogeneous group. our results are consistent with those of earlier reports (21,
35) that dentition status among institutionalised older people is
poor. over 50% of the residents in our study were edentulous
and 7% of the sample had no dentures. Those residents who
were edentulous and had no dentures were at particular risk for
malnutrition. This finding is in line with those of previous
studies by lamy et al. (21), andersson et al. (36) and Soini e al.
(35). understandably, pureed or soft food consumption was also
reported most frequently in edentulous subjects without
dentures. Surprisingly, the nurses´ evaluation indicated that
edentulous residents in Group 1 ate normal amounts of food at
meals more often than did those in other groups. This may be
due to the fact that residents in Group 1 more often consumed
pureed or soft food, the amount of which is difficult to evaluate
and to compare with portions of normal food. it is alarming that
Group 1 having the highest number of oral symptoms had the
least possibilities to oral examinations.
Bivariate analysis revealed that dentition status was
significantly associated with mortality, although this
association diminished after adjustment for age, gender, MNA
score and comorbidity. This finding is inconsistent with earlier
findings, however. Shimazaki et al. (26) reported that the six year mortality rate controlling for age, sex, physical-mental
health status, type of institution, cerebrovascular disorder,
cardiovascular disease and musculoskeletal disease among
edentulous subjects without dentures was significantly higher
than that among subjects with 20 or more teeth. in Finnish
study by Hämäläinen et al. (27) found that the smaller the
number of teeth the subject had, the higher their risk of death.
Dental variables proved to be significant predictors of mortality
even after controlling for gender, number of chronic diseases
and self-rated health. Österberg et al. (30) showed that the
number of teeth was still an important predictor of mortality
after adjusting for the most important covariates as health
factors, socio-economic factors and lifestyle factors. However,
in all these three studies the population differs from ours having
significantly less disabilities and comorbidities. Thus, in our
frail population living their last years of life there are several
other competing factors contributing to mortality. For example,
based on previous studies (23-25) we considered nutritional
status as a potential confounder in the analysis of the
relationship between dentition status and mortality. The
relationship between oral health and nutrition is
multidirectional and complex (2, 37).
our results suggest a need for cooperation between nursing
staff and oral health care professionals to maintain good
nutritional status of older service housing residents. Dentition
status and oral health should be considered a part of the
nutritional assessment of older adults. There seems to be a need
for training nurses to consider these issues. older adults should
also have regular oral examinations and treatment. Acknowledgments: Conflict of interest: The authors declare that there is no conflict of

We evaluated if poororal status was associated with risk of malnutrition and malnutrition in this population.Methods: A random sample of 471 south Brazilians 60 y of age was evaluated. Measurementsincluded a questionnaire to assess sociodemographic, behavioral, general, and oral health data;nutritional status assessment, according to the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA); and oral statusassessment, by means of oral examinations assessing the number of teeth and use of dentalprostheses. Correlates of risk of malnutrition/malnutrition according to the MNA were assessed bymeans of multivariate logistic regression.Results: Participants who reported dissatisfaction with their gingival health and edentulous personswearing only one denture were more likely to be at risk of malnutrition, according to the screeningMNA. Dissatisfaction with gingival health was a risk indicator, whereas having one to eight naturalteeth was protective against the risk of malnutrition/malnutrition according to the full MNA.Conclusion: In the present study, older people with a compromised oral status had higher odds forrisk of malnutrition. The maintenance of a few teeth had a crucial role in increasing the chance ofmaintaining an adequate nutritional status in the studied population.

All rights reserved.Keywords: Aged; Nutritional assessment; Oral health; Geriatric dentistry; Tooth loss; Complete dentures","Introduction It is estimated that developing countries will experience a threefold increase in the proportion of older people in the next 30 y [1]. In Brazil more specifically, the elderly currently represent the fastest-growing age group. These Changes in the population structure are expected to dramatically increase the burden to public health systems in such developing countries [2].Poor oral health among aged persons in particular represents an important public health issue and a growing burden to countries worldwide [3]. Poor general health and poor oral health are interrelated, especially among older people, primarily because of common risk factors.Research findings also point to more complex relations,with oral infections such as periodontitis indicating a risk for chronic diseases, including ischemic heart disease [4],but also being aggravated by chronic diseases such as diabetes[5]. Moreover, recent studies have indicated that partial tooth loss and edentulism have a potential role in mortality due to cardiovascular disease[6–8]and all-cause mortality[9].Hypotheses to explain such associations of oral health/disease with general health include the effects of oral dis-ease, chronic periodontitis in particular, in inflammation[10]and the effects of tooth loss and poor masticatory function in diet and nutritional status. In this regard, poor oral health and poor oral function have been implicated as risk indicators for a poor diet. Aged people with fewer teeth are known to be particularly more likely to eat less nutrient-rich food including vegetables, fruits, meat, and whole grains[11–13]. Persons who have masticatory dysfunction may adapt food consistency to their dental status, resulting in an increased consumption of soft and easy-to-eat food with a generally poor-quality diet[14 –17]. Edentulous people frequently report difficulties chewing foods that are hard or fibrous in texture[18,19]. There is evidence suggestingthat edentulous persons lack specific nutrients and that thesenutritional deficiencies could ultimately result in an increasein the incidence of various health disorders[20,21]. Thus,the detection of risk of malnutrition and of malnutritionusing simple, non-invasive, and accurate measurementswould represent an important step towards the provision ofimproved health care for older people[22,23].The existing evidence indicates that several factors, in-cluding age-related physiologic and social changes, chronicdiseases, decreased mobility[23], medication use, swallow-ing problems, and depression[24]influence nutritional in-take, making older people more prone to risk of malnutritionand malnutrition. Although tooth loss is known to affect theability to chew, a relatively small number of studies haveassessed whether partial tooth loss and edentulism are pre-dictors of nutritional status among independent-living olderpersons using measurements that assess the risk of malnu-trition and malnutrition such as the Mini-Nutritional Assess-ment (MNA). The existing evidence shows that a poor oralstatus predicts underweight in older people[18,23]and thatself-reported edentulism is a risk factor for weight gains5% in 1 y among aged North Americans[17], but reportson more comprehensive nutritional assessments are scarce.Such information would be of relevance because malnutri-tion, although not extremely prevalent in independent-livingolder people, has been identified as a component of frailty inaged persons[25]and is an important predictor of morbidityand mortality[21]. The few studies assessing whether oralstatus predicts risk of malnutrition and malnutrition accord-ing to the MNA were carried out in samples of aged personsliving in institutions or staying in hospitals. The findingsfrom these studies showed that edentulous older people notwearing dentures and living in long-term care residenceshave lower MNA scores[26]and are more likely to bemalnourished[27].Aged persons living in institutions or hospitalized, how-ever, represent populations with characteristics that are dif-ferent from those observed in elderly people living in thecommunity[28]. It is not known whether such associationsremain significant in older people living in the communityor whether partial tooth loss and edentulism that are notreplaced by dental prostheses increase the chance for risk ofmalnutrition and malnutrition.Our hypothesis is that independent-living older peoplewith complete tooth loss that was not rehabilitated withcomplete dental prostheses would be more likely to be atrisk of malnutrition or malnourished than edentulous peoplewearing complete dentures or aged persons with naturalteeth. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate ifpoor oral health status was associated with risk of malnu-trition and malnutrition insouth Brazilian independent-livingolder people.Materials and methodsStudy designThis was a cross-sectional study, with a simple random-sampling design. A random numbers table was used toselect participants from the municipality registers of indi-viduals60 y of age. Potential participants were invitedthrough telephone or letter in cases where telephone num-bers were not available. Those who refused to participatewere replaced using subsequent numbers in the randomnumbers table that was generated previously and the mu-nicipality registers of citizens60 y of age.The present study is based on data collected in a largerstudy about the associations of oral health status, with anemphasis on the number of teeth and use of dental prosthe-ses, and the nutritional status, diet, and anthropometricmeasurements of independent-living older people in the cityof Carlos Barbosa, southern Brazil. The city had 20 519inhabitants in 2000, of which approximately 2100 were60 y of age according to the most recent Brazilian census.Population and samplePrevious data from a study about body composition andoral health performed by our group in the city of CarlosBarbosa in 2004 was used to calculate sample size. Thecalculation was performed using a bidirectionalof 0.05and aof 0.20, with 407 participants required to detectdifferences with respect to oral status between subjectsclassified as being eutrophic or malnourished. We added20% to that number to compensate for refusals, adding up toa total sample of 480 participants.A sample of 471 participants was evaluated betweenMarch and December 2006. Only persons60 y of age,living independently, and generally healthy were invited totake part in the study. Generally healthy persons were de-fined as those whose physical, medical, and mental statusesallowed them to travel and to participate in a comprehensiveoral health examination conducted in a clinical setting [29].We were not able to contact 57 elderly individuals after trying at least three telephone contacts and sending oneletter, 23 elderly individuals were restricted to bed at home,and 9 elderly individuals refused to participate for unknownreasons.This study was approved by the committee of ethics inresearch of the Faculty of Dentistry of the Federal Univer-sity of Rio Grande do Sul and all participants providedwritten informed consent.MeasurementsData collection took place in community clubhousesprovided by the municipality and included interviews,anthropometric measurements, nutritional status assess-ments, andoral examinations. All participants completed aninterviewer-administered structured questionnaire, whichcomprised 36 questions assessing a wide range of social,demographic, behavioral, and self-reported medical anddental health data. Nutritional status was assessed using theMNA. The oral status assessment comprised an oral examination assessing the number of natural teeth and the use of dental prostheses.Socio Demographic and behavioral data, medical and dental history assessments Sociodemographic and behavioral data included information regarding age, monthly family income, schooling,ethnicity, gender, marital status, geographic localization of the family residence, and smoking status. Current medical history and intake of medications were self-reported. The Intake of medications was registered as the number of prescription medications taken daily. Current medical history incorporated a review of 19 diseases that included hypertension, arthritis, cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes.A summary measurement of the number of conditions was used in the analysis (chronic conditions were considered present if the number of self-reported conditions was at least two)[30].Self-rated gingival health and self-rated teeth/denture health were assessed as part of the oral health evaluation.Participants were asked about the degree of satisfaction with their own gingiva and teeth/denture health, with answers ona 5-point Likert type scale ranging from “extremely satisfied” to “extremely dissatisfied.”Nutritional status assessment The MAN[31]is a comprehensive tool that was originally developed for the assessment of nutritional status of older patients in clinics, nursing homes, hospitals, or among those who are otherwise frail. More recently, the MNA has also been used in the assessment of nutritional risk in community-dwelling elderly populations[32]. The MNA comprises 18 items grouped in the following sections: anthropometrics(weight, height, and weight loss), general assessment (life-style, medication use, and mobility), dietary assessment(number of meals, food and fluid intake, and autonomy offeeding), and subjective assessment (self-perception of health and nutrition status)[31]. The MNA incorporates two scores. The screening MNA has six items with scores rang-ing from 0 to 14. Older people with scores6 are classifiedas at risk of malnutrition and those with scores6 areclassified as normal with respect to the screening MNA. Thefull MNA is comprised of all 18 MNA items, with scoresranging from 0 to 30. Older persons with scores25 areclassified as having a normal nutritional status, those withscores from 17 to 24 are classified as at risk of malnutrition,and those with scores17 are classified as malnourished[31]. Risk of malnutrition and malnutrition categories ac-cording to the full MNA were grouped as risk of malnutri-tion/malnutrition for analysis purposes because there wereonly six participants classified as malnourished according tothe full MNA.To measure body fatness, which is one of the items thatis part of the MNA, height and weight measurements wereused to derive the body mass index (BMI), a ratio calculatedby reference to weight in kilograms and height in meterssquared. Height was measured with a portable stadiometer(Seca 206 centimeter measuring tape with wall stop; Seca,Hamburg, Germany). Participants were measured withouttheir shoes and head horizontal in the Frankfurt plane.Weight was measured using a digital personal scale on ahard, level surface (Tanita body fat monitor/scale TBF-612;Tanita Corp., Maeno-Cho Itabashi-Ku, Tokyo, Japan).Participants received scores based on their BMI values:score 0 was attributed to participants whose BMI was19 kg/m2, score 1 to participants whose BMI was 19 or20 kg/m2, score 2 to participants whose BMI was 21 or 22kg/m2, and score 3 to participants whose BMI was23kg/m2. Higher scores implied better nutrition.Midarm circumference of the dominant arm was mea-sured in centimeters. The distance between the acromialsurface of the scapula and the olecranon process of theelbow, on the back of the arm, was measured and themidpoint between the two points was marked with a pen asa reference for measuring the circumference of the arm. Thecalf circumference was measured in centimeters at the wid-est part, with the calf uncovered.Additional measurements above and below this pointwere taken to ensure that the initial measurement was thelargest. For midarm circumference, participants received thefollowing scores: 0, if midarmcircumference was21 cm,0.5 if it was 21 to 22 cm, and 1.0 if it was22 cm. For calfcircumference, participants received the following scores: 0,if calf circumference was31 cm, and 1.0, if31 cm.Oral examinationsDental status was assessed by recording the number ofnatural teeth, which subsequently was used to calculate thenumber of missing teeth per subject (i.e., 28 minus the sum of present teeth; third molars were excluded). The presenceand type of dental prostheses for both arches was registeredin accordance with World Health Organization criteria[33].Dental prostheses in each arch were classified as absent,fixed prosthesis, removable dentures with fixed prosthesis,removable partial dentures, and complete dentures. The dataregarding the number of natural teeth and the presence ofcomplete dental prostheses in both dental arches were usedto generate a new variable, oral status. Participants werecategorized as edentulous wearing upper and lower den-tures, if the participant was edentulous and wore upper andlower complete dentures; edentulous wearing only one den-ture, if the participant was edentulous and wore only theupper or the lower complete denture; dentate with one toeight teeth, if the participant had one to eight natural teeth;and dentate with more than eight teeth, if the participant hadmore than eight natural teeth (75th percentile for thevariable number of teeth). All examinations were carried outby a single dentist with previous experience in clinicalgeriatric dentistry who was trained to use the criteria de-scribed inMATERIALS AND METHODSbefore the beginning ofthe study.Statistical analysesChi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests were performedfor categorical variables, and Student’sttests or Mann-Whitney tests were used for continuous variables. The valuefor rejection of the null hypothesis was set atP0.05.Fisher’s exact tests were used instead of chi-square tests incases where there were fewer than five cases in a given cell(i.e., ethnic group). Mann-Whitney tests were used insteadof Student’sttests when continuous variables followed thenon-parametrical distribution.To test the study hypothesis, all independent variablesthat showed association withP0.25 and those withclinical/epidemiologic relevance, according to data in theliterature, were candidates to the multivariate model, ac-cording to the Enter method[34]. Variables that did notcontribute (i.e.,P0.25) to the model were eliminated anda new model was calculated. The new model was alwayscompared with the previous one using the likelihood ratiotest. Crude and adjusted odds ratios are presented with therespective 95% confidence intervals.Associations with the screening MNA and full MNAcategories were adjusted by means of multivariate logisticregressions for sociodemographic, behaviorial, and medicalvariables, including age (in years), monthly family income(in reais; US $1 US was equivalent to 2.15 Brazilian reaiswhen the data were collected), geographic localization ofparticipants’ residences (urban or rural), marital status (mar-ried or single/divorced/widowed), smoking status (formeror non-smoker and current smoker), race (white or non-white), gender, schooling (up to4yor4 y of formal education), and presence of chronic conditions (yes or no).The following oral health status variables were assessed forassociations with nutritional status outcomes: self-reportedsatisfaction with gingival health and self-reported satisfac-tion with teeth/dentures health and oral status. For analysispurposes, self-perceived gingival teeth/denture health vari-ables were recategorized. The extremely satisfied, very sat-isfied, and moderately satisfied categories were groupedunder a single category, as were the dissatisfied and ex-tremely dissatisfied categories. Analyses were performedwith SPSS 12.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).ResultsThere was a larger percentage of female participants inthe studied sample. Age ranged from 60 to 92 y and averagemonthly income was 593.00 reais (equivalent to US$269.00 during the period when data collection was carriedout). Most participants were white and married. Only 23%of the examined sample had more than eight teeth and44.3% of participants were edentulous. The average numberof teeth in the studied sample was 5.477.04, and theaverage number of teeth in participants with at least eightteeth was 14.455.96. There were 125 participants(26.5%) at risk of malnutrition according to the screeningMNA. Only six participants (1.3%) were classified as mal-nourished according to the full MNA. An additional 91 participants (19.3%) were at risk of malnutrition according to the full MNA.Characteristics of the studied sample with respect to the screening MNA are listed in Table 1. The only variables significantly associated with risk of malnutrition according to the screening MNA in the univariate analysis were oralstatus and self-rated gingival health.Table 2 presents the characteristics of the studied sample with respect to the full MNA. The univariate analysis revealed that participants at risk of malnutrition/malnutrition according to the full MNA were less likely to be female and had significantly fewer teeth than well-nourished elderly. Oral status also differed significantly between participants at risk of malnutrition or were malnourished and those who were well nourished.Dissatisfaction with gingival health was significantly associated with risk of malnutrition/malnutrition according to the full MNA.Variables independently associated with the screeningMNA adjusted by means of multivariate logistic regression are listed in Table 3. Older people who reported dissatisfaction with their own gingival health and edentulous people wearing only one denture were more likely to be at risk of malnutrition according to the screening MNA. Variables Independently associated with the full MNA adjusted by means of multivariate logistic regression are listed in Table 4. Participants who reported dissatisfaction with their own gingival health were more likely to be at risk of malnutrition/malnourished. Having one to eight natural teeth was protective against the risk of malnutrition/malnutrition.Discussion Our results showed that study participants with worseoral status and dissatisfaction with their gingival health had higher odds of risk of malnutrition, according to the MNA.In addition, having even a few natural teeth was protective against the risk of malnutrition/malnutrition. This is one of the few studies to our knowledge showing that edentulism,which was not rehabilitated with a set of complete dentures,and self-rated gingival health were associated with risk of malnutrition according to the MNA in a representative sample of community-dwelling older people. These findings are of relevance due to the known effects of malnutrition in frailty[25], morbidity, and mortality[21]in older people.An important aspect in relation to the analysis of the screening and full MNA scores presented in this study is related to the different oral status categories significantly associated with each of the two outcomes. The full score represents a more comprehensive measurement or nutritional state; otherwise the screening form could be used in epidemiologic surveys due to its simplicity and fast application and its relation to oral status observed in this study.The associations between poor oral health and diet have been shown previously in the literature, with older people with compromised dentition eating significantly less nutrient-rich foods than older people with functional dentition[12–17].Self-reported edentulism has been associated with diminished micronutrient intake and consumption of hard-to-chew foods[17]. Interestingly, to date only studies carried out in samples of hospitalized[35]or institutionalized[36]elderly have assessed whether a poor oral health status may result in risk of malnutrition as a result of an inadequate diet using a simple nutritional assessment tool such as the MNA[27]. However, chronic disease, frailty, and cognitive impairments are much more prevalent in these populations than in community-dwelling elderly[37], limiting the generalization of results from these previous studies. The association between a poor oral status and nutritional status observed in the present study may be explained by impairments in masticatory function due to extensive tooth loss that was not rehabilitated by a set of complete dental prostheses. In the present study, edentulous participants wearing only one denture reported dissatisfaction with chewing ability more frequently than others (data not shown), supporting the notion that masticatory function, which is known to affect food choice[12], may be related to the observed results. Such a notion is confirmed at least in part by a study in which edentulous older women reporting chewing difficulties had lower plasmatic concentrations of some key micronutrients that included carotenoids and 25-hydroxyvitamin D[21]. Interestingly, there is plenty of evidence showing that dental prosthetic rehabilitations are not capable of fully restoring mastication and bite force[12,15], butin the present study participants not wearing a set of complete dentures were more likely to be at risk of malnutrition,which indicates that, in cases of edentulism, wearing two complete dentures represented an advantage in terms of having a good nutritional status for the studied population.In this study, having as few as one to eight teeth was associated with better nutritional status. It is difficult to compare these results with the existing literature because of differences regarding population characteristics and outcomes, but our findings suggest that in populations where edentulism is extremely common[38], having even a few natural teeth may have had a beneficial role on nutrition-related parameters. These findings expand the existing evi-dence from a study performed in the United Kingdom[39]and from another performed in Thailand[40]indicating thathaving functional dentition (i.e.,20 natural teeth) is asso-ciated with the maintenance of an adequate body composi-tion during aging, and from a North American study whereself-reported edentulism was a risk factor for weight gains5% in 1 y[17].Some different interpretations to the reported associationbetween risk of malnutrition and dissatisfaction with gingi-val health are feasible. It is known that measurements of perceived health status rely on individual judgments, values,and beliefs, reflecting the extent to which a person experiences function/dysfunction and comfort/discomfort, for example[41]. Thus, edentulous older people may experience pain, discomfort, or poor denture stability due to severe residual alveolar ridge resorption or oral mucosal lesions[42], whereas dentate elderly with periodontitis and/or tooth mobility may experience pain, both resulting in chewing difficulties[43]that may lead to an increased chance of malnutrition observed in the present study.Although the association between oral health status and lower MNA scores remained significant after adjustment for several confounders, an important limitation of the present study was that medical diseases were self-reported.Confirmation of the diagnosis by a physician would result in more reliable results with respect to the presence of chronic conditions and, consequently, to a more precise adjustment for confounders when assessing the relation between oral health variables and nutritional status. Another Limitation of the present study is related to a lack of association between having more than eight teeth and the stud-ied outcomes.Such an absence of association may be related to the small number of subjects classified into this category in the studied sample, which may have resulted in a lack of statistical power. Moreover, the cross-sectional study design does not allow the examination of cause-and-effect relations, limiting our conclusions. Future studies examining whether tooth loss rehabilitated with dental prostheses is associated with the maintenance of an adequate nutritional status and body mass and longitudinal studies assessing whether incident tooth loss represents a risk for malnutrition among community-dwelling older people are needed. In conclusion, the results of the present study support the hypothesis that poor oral health is associated with a risk of malnutrition and with malnutrition in the studied sample.The implications of this study include the need for increased consciousness by dental and nutritional professionals of the importance of keeping good oral health for the maintenance of good nutritional status in older people living in the community. Public health policies aimed at preserving natural teeth in older populations may have a positive impact on nutritional status and dietary intake at the population level.",-,"[1] Barreto SM, Passos VMA, Lima-Costa MFF.

"Edentulism, use of dentures and consumption of fruit and vegetables in south Brazilian community-dwelling elderly","R. J. DE MARCHI*, F. N. HUGO*, D. M. P. PADILHA*, J. B. HILGERT*,D. B. MACHADO†, P. C. DURGANTE†& M. T. ANTUNES†","SUMMARY There is evidence suggesting that edentulous older persons modify their diet, avoiding foods that are difficult to chew, such as fruit and vegetables; meanwhile, the consumption of these foods is associated with prevention of chronic diseases.However, few studies evaluated whether a poor oral status without prosthetic rehabilitation is associated with a reduction in the consumption of fruit and vegetables in community-dwelling older persons. We evaluated the association of oral status with emphasis on complete dentures use with the daily consumption of at least 400 g of fruit and vegetables, following the recommendations of the WHO. A random sample of 282 south Brazilians‡60 years of age was evaluated. Measurements Included a questionnaire to assess socio demographic-ic, behaviour, and health data; consume of fruit and vegetables by means of a 24-h diet recall, and oralstatus assessment, by means of oral examinations assessing the number of teeth and use of dental prosthesis. Multivariate Poisson regression showed that the only variable significantly associated with inadequate consumption of fruit and vegetables was edentulism with the use of only one denture[PR = 1Æ75 (1Æ11–2Æ74)]. Edentulous participants wearing only one denture were less likely to consume at least 400 g day)1 of fruit and vegetables.These results indicate that, in edentulous community-dwelling elderly, oral health rehabilitation might play an important role in the maintenance of consumption of adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables, which is an important component of a healthy diet and also in the prevention of chronic diseases.KEYWORDS: aged, fruit and vegetables, tooth loss,edentulism, dentures, nutrition, diet","Introduction In developing countries, the demographic transition and the concurrent increase in the number of older persons represent a major challenge to public health systems. In Brazil, more specifically, the elderly represent nowadays the fastest-growing age group (1). In this context, nutrition is an important factor contributing to health and functional ability during ageing, and the impact of the nutritional state on physical and psychological well-being is especially high in the elderly (2).Furthermore, chronic diseases, infections and poor oral health, more notably tooth loss, are more frequent in older persons (3). In this context, Hugo Et al.(4)based on the data from the SB Brazil Survey (2003)identified on a representative sample of the Brazilian Population a DMF-T Index (Rate of Decayed, Missing And Filled Teeth) of 27Æ8 (with a maximum value of 32)among people aged 65–74 years, where the missing teeth represented almost 93% of the score.Previous evidence shows that fruit and vegetables are important components of a healthy diet and that their consumption is important in preventing a wide range of diseases (5). The existing evidence also supports a protective effect related to the consumption of fruit and vegetables on the risk of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction development in both women and men (6, 7). Furthermore, No ̈thlingset al.(8) found an inverse relation between fruit, legume and vegetable consumption and risk for all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality.According to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO), inadequate consumption of fruit and vegetables is one of the five main factors in the global burden of disease. Because of the global need to decrease the incidence of chronic, non-communicable diseases, in 2002, the WHO proposed a worldwide prevention strategy to promote healthy eating practices.One of the main recommendations was increased consumption of fruit and vegetables, the reference for which was a recommended daily intake of at least 400 g, or the equivalent of five servings (9).In Brazil, Fisberg and co-workers (2) estimated that less than half of all adults consume vegetables daily,while fewer than a third report daily consumption of fruit, and only one in eight meets the recommendation of consuming five or more servings a day of fruit and vegetables. In the United States, Arab and Su (10) used indexes that measure dietary quality, summarising the main characteristics of healthful eating habits and allowing for the identification of lower consume of fruit and vegetables among vulnerable segments of the population. However, because of methodological changes in dietary measurements over time, few studies have evaluated trends in food consumption, particularly that of fruit and vegetables.Tooth loss has been associated with decreased masticatory performance, perceived ease of chewing and acceptability of some specific foods, including the decrease in the range of foods eaten (11, 12). As reported by Moynihan (13) tooth loss, edentulism and decreased salivation affect the ability to eat and compromise the nutrient intake of older adults. Sheiham and co-workers(14) in a study with a representative sample of older people in the United Kingdom found that a compromised oral health increases the chance for inadequate consumption of hard-to-chew foods. Particularly among edentulous persons, a significant reduction in the intake of non-starch polysaccharides (dietary fibre) (12, 15) andalso in some kinds of fruit and vegetables has also been reported (16, 17). Further than changes in diet, previous investigations have suggested that edentulism without rehabilitation by a set of complete dentures has a large influence on the nutritional status of both institutionalised (18) and community-dwelling older people (19).One explanation for these differences on diet hasbeen that perceived chewing ability is closely related to comfort when people chew, especially as regards hard-to-chew foods, and as a result, eating can be uncomfortable where teeth have been lost (19). Hyland Et al.(20) in a qualitative study with older people in United Kingdom observed that one of the main impacts of edentulousness was the limitation of food choice.Participants regarded the limitation in dietary choices because they were often concerned to avoid embarrassment when eating in a social context.Even though tooth loss is known to affect the ability to chew, food choices and even nutritional status, a relatively small number of studies assessed whether edentulism was a predictor of the consumption of fruit and vegetables among community-dwelling elderly in newly industrialising economies, such as the case of Brazil, using measures that assess the intake of these foods, such as the 24-h recall. Furthermore, there aren't many studies, at least to our knowledge, which assessed whether the oral rehabilitation by means of conventional complete dentures in cases of edentulism increases the chance of consuming the recommended daily amount of fruit and vegetables, in a population with a large prevalence of extensive tooth loss and edentulism, such as the Brazilian elderly (4).Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether oral status with emphasis in edentulism and complete dentures use was associated with the daily consumption of the recommended amounts of fruit and vegetables in south Brazilian community-dwelling older people.Materials and methods Study design This was a cross-sectional study, with a simple random sampling design. A random numbers table was used to select participants from the municipality registers of individuals aged 60 years or more from the city of Carlos Barbosa, southern Brazil. Potential participants were invited through telephone or letter in cases where telephone numbers were not available. Those who refused to participate were replaced using subsequent numbers in the random numbers table that was generated previously and the municipality registers.This study is based on data collected in a larger study about the associations of oral health status, with an emphasis on the number of teeth and use of dental prostheses, and the nutritional status, diet and anthropometric measurements of independent-living older people in the city of Carlos Barbosa, southern Brazil(19). The city had 20 519 inhabitants in 2000, of which approximately 2100 were 60 years old or more according to the most recent Brazilian census.A sample of 471 participants was evaluated between March and December of 2006. Only persons aged 60 years or more, living independently and generally healthy, were invited to take part in the study.Generally healthy persons were defined as those whose physical, medical and mental statuses allowed them to travel and to participate in a comprehensive oral health examination conducted in a clinical setting (21). The Final sample for the oral health survey, drawn from those who effectively responded the 24-h recall, comprehended 282 individuals, representing 60% of theissued sample. To check representativeness of the study participants, socio demographic data of the population of aged persons of Carlos Barbosa city was retrieved from the municipality records. There were no significant differences regarding age, gender, marital status and geographic location of residences between study participants and the overall population aged 60 years or more living in Carlos Barbosa (Table 1). This study was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Research of the Faculty of Dentistry of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, and all participants provided written informed consent.Measurement Data collection included interviews, anthropometric measurements, nutritional status assessment and oral examinations. All participants completed an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire, whichcomprised 36 questions assessing a wide range of social,demographic, behavioural and self-reported medical and dental health data. The oral status assessment comprised an oral examination assessing the number of natural teeth and the use of dental prosthesis.Sociodemographic and behavioural data, medical and dental history assessments Sociodemographic and behavioural data included information regarding age, monthly family income, school-ing, ethnicity, gender, marital status, geographic localization of the family residence, and smoking status.Current medical history and intake of medications were self-reported. The intake of medications was registered as the number of prescription medications taken daily.Current medical history incorporated a review of 10 diseases that included hypertension, arthritis, cancer,heart disease and diabetes.A summary measurement of the number of conditions was used in the analysis (chronic conditions were considered present if the number of self-reported conditions was at least two) (22).Oral examinations Oral status was assessed by recording the number of natural teeth and the use of dental prosthesis, according to the WHO criteria (23). Oral status categories were defined as follows: edentulous wearing one denture,edentulous wearing both dentures, dentate with one to eight teeth using none or one removable prostheses,dentate with one to eight teeth using two removable prostheses and dentate with more than eight teeth,according with the quartiles of the sample concerning the number of natural teeth. All examinations were carried out by a single dentist with previous experience in clinical geriatric dentistry who was trained to use the criteria described in Materials and methods before the beginning of the study. More details are provided elsewhere (19).Dietary profileThe dietary profile of the study participants was analyzed by means of a 24-h food recall obtained through a direct and individual interview carried out by the researcher. Detailed information about the quantities of foods consumed was collected, and the recall was performed only in weekdays. The amount of fruit and vegetables (FV) consumed per person per day was calculated using the software Nutwin v. 1Æ5 (UNIFESP,São ̃o Paulo, Brazil). Participants were categorised using a cut point the values recommended by the Program‘5-a-day’, which establishes that the minimum consumption of FV should be of at least 400 g day)1(9).Thus, participants were categorised in respect to the outcome as those who consumed‡400g day)1 of FV(i.e. consuming the recommended amounts of FVdaily), and as those who consumed <400 g day)1ofFV (i.e. those consuming less than the recommended amounts of FV daily).Statistical analysis Chi-square test was performed for categorical variables,and Student’st-test was used for continuous variables.The value for rejection of the null hypothesis was set atP<0Æ05. To test the study hypothesis, all independent variables that showed association with P<0Æ25 and those with clinical⁄epidemiologic relevance, according to data in the literature, were candidates to the multivariate model (24). Variables that did not contribute (i.e.P>0Æ25) to the model were eliminated, and anew model was calculated. The unadjusted andadjusted prevalence ratios are presented with therespective 95% confidence intervals.Associations with the FV categories were adjusted bymeans of Poisson regression with robust variance forsociodemographic, behavioural and medical variables,including age (categorised as 60–74 or‡75 years ofage), monthly income (data were collected in BrazilianReais and later categorised into those receiving 1 or lessminimum wage or >1 minimum wage, which wasequivalent to R$ 385,00 when data collection wascarried out; US$1 was equivalent to 2Æ15 Brazilian Reaiswhen the data were collected), geographic localisationof participants’ residences (urban or rural), maritalstatus (married or single⁄divorced⁄widowed), smokingstatus (former or non-smoker and current smoker),race (white or non-white), gender, schooling (up to4 years or >4 years of formal education), and presenceof chronic conditions (2 or more chronic conditions).Analyses were performed withSPSS16Æ0*.ResultsThere was a larger percentage of women in the studiedsample. Age ranged from 60 to 89 years, and averagemonthly income was 620Æ00 Reais (equivalent to US $281Æ00 during the period when data collection wascarried out). Most participants were white and married.Only 26% of the examined sample had eight or morethan eight teeth, and 43Æ7% of participants wereedentulous. The average number of teeth in the studiedsample was 5Æ877Æ19. There were 138 participants(48Æ9%) who consumed <400 g day)1of FV.Characteristics of the studied sample in respect toconsumption of FV are shown in Table 2. The onlyvariable significantly associated with less than recom-mended daily consumption of FV in the multivariateanalysis was edentulism with the use of only onedenture [PR: 1Æ75 (1Æ11–2Æ74)]. Variables independently associated with consume of FV (above and below 400 g day)1) adjusted by means of Poisson regression with robust variance (24) are shown in Table 3.Discussion Our results showed that edentulous participants wearing only one complete denture presented a significant higher chance for consuming less than the recommended daily amounts of fruit and vegetables. This Finding is of relevance, as inadequate consumption of fruit and vegetables is recognised as one of the five main factors in the global burden of disease (9), and the intake of fruit and vegetables is known to reduce risks of cardiovascular disease (25), coronary heart disease(26, 27) and cancer (28, 29).The effects of edentulism and use of dentures on diet have been shown previously in the literature (30).Allen (17), assessing the impact of provision of new complete replacement dentures in Ireland, found that although most of the participants had control over preparation of their own food, their diet was still lacking in fruit, vegetables and fibre 2 months after completion of treatment. Results from US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) (2003) showed that biochemical analyte levels for nutrients found in fruit and vegetables, as well as the corresponding intake of dietary fibre, were significantly lower among edentulous persons (31). Although previous evidence has shown that edentulous older people consumed fewer non-starch polysaccharide (dietary fibre) (12, 14, 15), vegetables and some types of fruit (16, 17), this is the first study, atleast to our knowledge, showing that edentulism without rehabilitation by a set of complete dentures is associated with an important clinical indicator of the adequacy of fruit and vegetables’ consumption.The association between edentulism without use of dental prosthesis and consume of less than the recommended amounts of FV observed in the present study may be explained by avoidance of hard-to-chew foods like raw vegetables, resulting from impairments in masticatory function. This assumption is in accordance with the notion that if a subject believes a food will cause chewing difficulties or pain, he or she avoids eating that food (32), and also with evidence from a study of Sahyoun and Krall (33), where participants with self-perceived ill-fitting dentures had lower dietary quality scores, consumed fewer fruit and vegetables and had a lower variety of foods in their diets.Furthermore, the existing evidence also suggests that edentulous persons lack specific nutrients and that these nutritional deficiencies could ultimately result in an increase in the incidence of health disorders (34, 35).In another section of this research program, we found that older people who reported dissatisfaction with their own gingival health and edentulous wearing only one denture were more likely to be at risk of malnutrition, when evaluated with the screening Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNAÒ) (19). Those results corroborate previous evidence from a study by Lamya And co-workers (18) accessing diet and nutritional risk of elderly living in institutions. They found that edentulous patients without dentures or wearing only one complete denture were more likely to eat mashed food regularly, which was not sufficient to maintain good nutritional status according to the MNAÒ.Batt Et al.(36) suggested that edentulous older people may experience pain, discomfort, or poor denture stability because of severe residual alveolar ridge resorption or oral mucosal lesions. This may result in the avoidance of the use of dentures during meals or ultimately, the permanent avoidance of their use. Shahet al.(37) found a gap between edentulousness, denture wear and denture needs in India. The authors suggested that among the reasons for this disparity we're the spread misconception that tooth loss and edentulism were inevitable part of the ageing process and the lack of knowledge regarding oral health and economic deprivation among older people.Interestingly, there is evidence showing that dental prosthetic rehabilitations are not capable of fully restoring mastication and bite force (38). Furthermore,it has been suggested that prosthetic rehabilitation in the absence of dietary counselling does not lead to dietary improvement (17, 38). Evidence has also shown that when edentulous patients have been provided with dental implants to retain an oral prosthesis,improvement in food choice has occurred, but not toa dramatic extent (39). Hyland Et al.(20) evaluating seniors’ perspectives of how dentures affect eating found that, in fact, patients were often concerned to avoid embarrassment when eating amongst strangers,friends or even family. This commonly meant not consuming certain foods ‘in company’.It is difficult to compare our results with the existing literature because of differences regarding population characteristics and outcomes. The edentulous participants in this study are rather characteristic of persons who have been edentate for a long time. They have been using complete dentures for many years and had adapted to the limitations imposed by the loss of their natural teeth. If on one hand, the evidence shows that simply improving the quality of dentures in edentulous patients without nutritional counselling is unlikely to result in significant improvement in diet (38), on the other hand,it is also unlikely that edentulous without oral rehabilitation could manage to eat difficult-to-chew food, such as fruit and vegetables. Therefore, our findings suggest that in this population, where edentulism is extremely common (4), having some natural teeth or wearing complete set of dentures in case of edentulism may have had a beneficial role on consumption of the recommended amount of fruit and vegetables.The limitations of this study include the utilisation of a single 24-h recall in determining dietary intake.However, the 24-h recall has been selected as the most appropriate dietary methodology for collecting quantitative data from a large population (2). Moreover,socioeconomic status and education level, which are factors strongly influential on diet and food choices,showed to be very similar among the study participants(14). However, the cross-sectional design of the study does not allow the evaluation of cause-and-effect relationships, thus limiting our conclusions. There area number of social factors that also influence diet, and itis important to consider and control for these factors in this type of research (12). Future studies aimed at checking whether edentulism and tooth loss rehabilitated with dental prostheses is associated with the maintenance of an adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables, as well as longitudinal studies assessing whether incident tooth loss represents a risk for inadequate consumption of these foods among community-dwelling elderly are needed.In conclusion, the results of the present study support the hypothesis that edentulism without prosthetic rehabilitation is associated with risk of inadequate consumption of fruit and vegetables in the studied sample. The implications of this study include the need of increased awareness by dental and nutrition professionals of the importance of maintaining a good oral health, particularly the prosthetic rehabilitation when teeth have been lost, for the maintenance of a good diet during ageing, as dentures can provide a better masticatory capacity for edentulous people.Knowledge of the frequency and distribution of fruit and vegetables intake in the population, as well as their determinants, is necessary to orient national and local strategies to encourage consumption of these foods and promote healthy eating practices. Public health policies aimed to preserve natural teeth and provide oral rehabilitation for older adults may have a positive impact on nutritional status and dietary intake at the population level.Acknowledgments This study was supported in part by the Coordination For the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel(CAPES) – Brazilian Ministry of Education, and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) – Brazilian Ministry of Science And Technology.",-,"1.

Complete Edentulism and Comorbid Diseases: An Update,"David A. Felton, DDS, MS, FACP","The relationship between complete edentulism, which is the terminal outcome of a multifactorial oral disease process and other comorbid diseases, was first reported in 2009. Although the relationship between edentulism and a multitude of systemic diseases was reported, none of the publications studied could determine causality of tooth loss on the incidence of any comorbid disease. Since that publication, there has been a renewed interest in this relationship, and a plethora of new articles have been published. This article will provide an update on articles published since 2008 on the relationship between edentulism and comorbid diseases, and will include the relationship between complete edentulism and such comorbid conditions as malnutrition,obesity, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary diseases (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cancer, and even mortality. Keywords Complete edentulism; comorbid disease;malnutrition; obesity; rheumatoid arthritis;cardiovascular disease; pneumonia; COPD;cancer; dementia; mortality.","As prosthodontists and dentists, we have been treating the clinical condition of complete edentulism for over a millennium.Unfortunately, treatment of the edentulous patient may have in many academic institutions focused on the technical aspects of removable prostheses rather than the clinical rationale for treatment and long-term outcomes. According to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, the completely edentulous patient meets WHO criteria for being: (1) physically impaired,(2) disabled, and (3) handicapped.1-3 Consider the patient shown in Figure 1, a 23-year-old male with a history of chronic soft drink consumption, who presented in pain for dental treatment. Rather than attempting to salvage some remaining mandibular anterior teeth to retain a removable partial dental prosthesis, the patient was edentulated and allowed to heal. He underwent two additional surgeries before denture fabrication; the first surgery was required due to the failure to recognize and remove lateral bony exostosis that impede successful prosthesis insertion, and a second surgery is required to remove 5 to 7 mm of alveolar bone due to a lack of adequate interarch space. Finally, complete denture prosthesis were inserted on healed alveolar ridges. Given that the average life expectancy in the United States is 78.8 years, what does this 23-year-old edentulous patient have to look forward to over the next 55 years, and how might edentulation at this early age impact his overall systemic health?Incidence of complete edentulism in the United States and globally Over a decade ago, Douglas et al suggested that complete edentulism in the United States was not declining, and may,in fact, be on the rise. The authors suggested that the apparent decline in edentulism of approximately 10% per decade will be more than offset by the increase in the population growth of adults over the age of 55. They suggested that the completely edentulous population in the United States would increase from 33.6 to 37.9 million by 2020, due to population growth and increased life expectancies for the elderly.Slade et al evaluated edentulism trends in the United States.They investigated population trends in U.S. adults>15 years of age using five national cross-sectional health surveys (1957 to 1958, 1971 to 1975, 1988 to 1998, 1999 to 2002, and 2009 to 2012). These surveys included 155,524 individuals. The authors found that the prevalence of edentulism declined from 18.9% at the 1957 to 1958 cohort to 4.9% in the most recent age cohort. They reported the rate of edentulism in the United States in 2010 at 12.2 million. As might be expected, edentulism was a rare condition in high-income households, and states with higher levels of poverty experienced higher levels of edentulism. Slade et al projected that the rate of decline would slow to 2.6% by 2050; however, they also concluded that rate of decline in edentulism may be offset by population growth and aging. Wu et al reported similar findings. They evaluated social stratification and tooth retention in 11,812 adults 50+years of age between 1988 and 2004, using NHANES surveys.During this time, the rate of edentulism declined from 24.6%to 17.4%. In addition, the mean number of missing teeth declined from 8.19 to 6.5. Wu et al concluded that tooth loss and edentulism were directly related to race, lower income, and lower education levels. Given these data, it appears that the need for complete denture education must be continued for the next four or five decades in the United States.Globally, complete edentulism also appears to be on the decline. Kassebaum et al studied the effects of 291 diseases and their 1160 sequelae occurring between 1990 and 2010 globally. A total of 68 studies were selected and included 285,746 people in 26 countries ages 12 and older. A meta-analysis was conducted of the data. The results indicated that the global incidence of complete edentulism decreased from 4.4% to 4.1%between 1990 and 2010. Clearly, dentistry and prosthodontics have made an impact on tooth loss and complete edentulism;however, although a decline has been observed, we have not eliminated complete edentulism or the need for complete denture education, at least in the United States.Tooth loss and comorbid disease The relationship between tooth loss and other systemic comorbid conditions is, at best, multifactorial (Fig 2). What, then,is a comorbid condition? Comorbidity is one or more diseases(or disorders) that exist in addition to the primary disorder or disease for a given patient (in this case, complete edentulism).The combined relationship between the primary condition and the comorbidity can have profound impacts on the individual's overall health. In medicine, the Charlson Comorbidity Index Is the most widely used validated method for quantifying the effects of multiple diseases on a patient. It predicts the 1-year mortality rates for individuals with multiple systemic diseases.Of 22 possible conditions the Index uses, oral health is not one of the possible disease entities. In an evaluation of the relationship between complete edentulism and other systemic comorbid conditions, Felton Reported on a multitude of studies indicating that completely edentulous patients had a greater risk of developing coronary artery plaque formation, and for having certain cancers. In addition, edentulous patients had a greater incidence of asthma(OR=10.52) and diabetes. In addition, one study found a direct relationship between the number of remaining teeth and the incidence of dementia.10 Unfortunately, none of the studies reviewed could confirm whether the relationship between complete edentulism and these comorbid conditions was causal(i.e., a direct cause and effect relationship) or casual.The purpose of this report, then, is to provide an updated review of the current literature on the relationship between tooth loss, complete edentulism, and comorbid disease conditions.Methods To further investigate this relationship, the National Library of Medicine’s PubMed web site was used to search the literature using the following parameters:(1) Articles published since 2008(2) Patient cohorts studied had to have a minimum of 50 patients, and a control group for comparison.(3) MESH terms included complete edentulism, dentures,and tooth loss in combination with the following comorbidities: nutrition, cancer, cardiovascular disease,cognition or dementia, diabetes, mortality, respiratory or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).(4) Some portion of the investigated patient cohort had to be completely edentulous(5) Abstracts were reviewed, and articles printed and reviewed to determine if they met the inclusion criteria by single author.Results total of 225 abstracts of potential articles published since the 2009 report were reviewed, resulting in 95 full-text articles for review. Of these, 48 were found to meet the inclusion criteria.These were subdivided into categories evaluating edentulism and its relationship to the following comorbid conditions:(1) Impact on nutrition and obesity(2) Cardiovascular diseases(3) Diabetes(4) RA(5) Respiratory diseases, including COPD(6) Cancer(7) Cognitive disorders(8) Mortality Tables 1–10 present some of the pertinent data from the 2009 paper highlighted at the start of the table in bold/italic type, and the more recent data in standard type. In addition,some discussion is required to distinguish between the use of“Odds ratio” and “Hazard ratio,” which are reported from many of the manuscripts. As used here, “Odds ratio” is obtained from the use of logistic regression analysis, and relates to the ratio of proportions. In other words, an odds ratio of 2.3 implies that one patient cohort is at a 2.3-time greater risk for developing systemic comorbidity than a different patient cohort (i.e.,edentulous vs. dentate). “Hazard ratio” is obtained from a Cox Regression (i.e., survival analysis) statistical evaluation (i.e., the number of new cases of a “disease” occurring per population cohort, per unit time). The hazard ratio is the relative risk of the disease comorbidity occurring based on a comparison of eventrates during a given time period.Discussion Complete edentulism, nutrition, malnutrition,and obesity Malnutrition and obesity are the two general aspects of nutrition that have been studied related to tooth loss and denture wear.Nutrition and malnutrition (Table 1)In our previous report, Nowjack-Raymer and Sheiham,11Sahy-oun et al,12 and Slade et al 13 reported that tooth loss negatively influence nutritional intake, and that edentulous patients were at greater risk for malnutrition than the dentate or partially dentate cohort. In a systematic review, Lancker et al14founda direct correlation between poor oral health and malnutrition.Ioannidou et al 15 found that tooth loss was related to a decreased intake of vital nutrients, and that the risk was 1.42 times greater for each five teeth lost. De Marchi et al 16 reported that the edentulous patient cohort did not consume the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables. Han and Kim 17 Reported that in the denture-wearing cohort, 12.8% were malnourished while using dentures, whereas 20% experienced malnutrition if dentures were not used. De Marchi et al 18 found that the edentulous patient was 3.26 times more likely to suffer from malnutrition(OR=3.26 with one denture) then the partially dentate population, and that if a patient had up to eight remaining natural teeth,these teeth served as a protective mechanism against malnutrition. Saarela et al 19 reported that the denture-wearing patient cohort was better equipped to have an adequate diet, and that complete edentulism without dentures resulted in malnutrition.Obesity (Table 2)Obesity has emerged as one of the fastest growing medical conditions in the United States. It affects more than a third of the adult U.S. population. Obesity can lead to a multitude of comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancer, and premature death. The estimated annual cost associated with obesity is a significant part of the expenditures for health care in the United States. The Incidence of diabetes appears to be age- and ethnicity-related.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates of obesity are shown in Figure 3 for 2011; note how that increased by 2013 (Fig 4). Sadly, it is even worse for non-Hispanic blacks.Also note that inNOstate is the incidence of obesity less than 20% (U.S. CDC).In our previous report, only Sheiham et al 20 reported that the edentulous population was at an increased risk for obesity.De Marchi et al 21 found that a 3.28-time higher risk of obesity occurred if fewer than eight natural teeth remained (OR=3.28).For edentulous patients, Do Nascimento et al 22 reported that the edentulous patient cohort that did not wear dentures were at an increased risk of being obese (OR=2.88). Finally, Hamdan Et al,23in a randomized control trial, compared the nutritional intake of patients with well-fitting complete dentures, and those with implant-retained mandibular overdentures, but found no difference between the cohorts.Clearly, the evidence appears to support the premise that the edentulous patient appears at risk for poor nutritional intake, malnutrition, and obesity. Our abilities to provide exceptional complete denture prosthesis are essential to correct this situation.Complete edentulism and cardiovascular diseases (Table 3)Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, killing more than 370,000 adults annually. The Primary risk factors for cardiovascular disease are high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol levels, and smoking, although other risk factors also play a role in the disease progression(U.S. CDC).Our previous investigation pointed to the relationship between tooth loss and atherosclerotic plaque formation. Taguchi Et al 24 reported that tooth loss increased the risk of hypertension.Desvarieux et al 25 demonstrated that tooth loss was associated with an increase in the formation of carotid artery plaques, andSchwahn et al 26 showed that tooth loss and periodontal disease were associated with increased levels of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream. Since that report, two additional studies merit consideration.Medina-Solis et al,27in a cross-sectional survey of 13,966 participants with a mean age of nearly 51 years, found a rate of complete edentulism of 10.2%. They found that the effect of edentulism on angina pectoris was correlated with age, being more prevalent in the younger age group (OR=12.93).Polzer et al 28 conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether the number of remaining teeth is associated with circulatory mortality or all-cause mortality,and to determine whether the replacement of missing teeth would provide protection for the patient from mortality. They Identified 23 studies that met their inclusion criteria, including five that met moderate to high levels of quality. Their Assessment found a relationship between circulatory mortal-ity and the number of remaining teeth, as well as a relationship between all-cause mortality and the number of remaining teeth.Unfortunately, no studies determined whether the replacement of missing teeth protected the patient against mortality. Polzeret al indicated that the effects of denture use on circulatory mortality needed to be studied.Complete edentulism and diabetes (Table 4)Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of mortality in the United States. In 2012, over 29 million adults were diagnosed with the disease, and it is estimated that one in four people do not know they have the disease. In addition, 86 million are considered pre diabetic, and without diet and exercise, up to 30% of these individuals will become type 2 diabetics within 5 years (U.S.CDC). According to the WHO, diabetes is projected to be one of the world’s main killers and disablers within the next 25 years.Nearly 171 million globally are estimated to be affected by diabetes. Our previous report suggested that edentulous patients had a higher risk of developing non insulin dependent diabetes(Cleary and Hutton,29 and Medina-Solis et al 30).More recently, Azogui-Levy and Dray-Spira 31 Evaluated this relationship in a French population of 19,231 participants aged 35 and older. They collected data from their patient cohort over three visits in a 2-year period and found that diabetics were older (mean age of 66 years vs. 52 years for non diabetics), more likely to be obese (35% vs. 12%), and had a higher prevalence of oral health problems (16.4%) than non diabetics (13.4%). They Also determined that diabetics were more likely to experience dental problems (OR=1.47), and were more than twice as likely to wear removable prostheses (62%) than non diabetics were (33%; OR=2.17).Pateletal32analyzed NHANES 2003 to 2004 data of 2508 participants 50 years of age and older. They found the prevalence of edentulism was 28% for the diabetic population, but only 14% for the non diabetic cohort. Multiple Regression analysis indicated that patients with diabetes were more likely to be edentulous than those without diabetes(OR=2.25).Complete edentulism and RA (Table 5)RA is a systemic inflammatory disease that can manifest itself in numerous joints in the body. The inflammation primarily affects the synovial membrane, leading to cartilage and bone erosions and occasionally, to joint deformity. Common joint manifestations include pain, swelling, and redness. It is believed to be the result of a faulty immune response. RA affects nearly 1.3 million in the United States, with women being affected 2.5 times as frequently as men (U.S. CDC). For a good review of the etiology and pathogenesis of RA, see Culshaw Et al.33In our previous study, we reported that de Pablo et al 34 found that patients with RA were at a 2.27-time greater risk for being edentulous than those with remaining teeth. This risk was3.34 times greater when the patient cohorts were adjusted for confounders (sex, age, smoking, and race-ethnicity). In a study of 9702 women using NHANES II data in a cross-sectional analysis, Demmer et al 35 found that completely edentulous patients experienced a statistically significant increase in the risk of incident RAY (OR=1.92) compared to those patients who had lost fewer than five teeth; however, the causality of RA asit relates to complete edentulism has not been demonstrated to date.Complete edentulism, respiratory diseases, andCOPD (Tables 6 and 7)Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized clinically by the inability to inspire and expire; it is generally associated with inflammation of the lung tissues. The major risk factor is smoking, but poor air quality may be implicated as well. COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States, and fifth leading cause globally.36 It is expected to become the fourth leading cause of death globally by 2030.37In the United States, COPD affects an estimated 24 million adults, and results in 700,000 hospital admissions and 124,000 deaths annually (U.S. CDC). Individuals with this disease are classified using the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification system; stages I to IV are identified, based on spirometry assessments. In our last report, which focused on asthma, we noted that Xie Et al 38,39 had reported that asthma was more likely to occur in the edentulous adult, and that the use of inhaled corticosteroids could lead to increased alveolar ridge resorption in the maxillary arch. Six studies were identified that reported on the association between tooth loss and respiratory diseases, including COPD and pneumonia.Respiratory infections (Table 6)Several studies have investigated tooth loss and denture use as it relates to the development of upper respiratory tract infection and dysphagia. A plausible mechanism of pneumonia could be associated with aspiration of oral pathogens from the mouth or associated prosthetic appliances.Sjogren et al 40 conducted a systematic review of the effects of good oral hygiene on respiratory tract infection and pneumonia in hospitals and nursing homes. They estimated that a reduction of 10% of the cases of death from pneumonia in nursing home residents could be associated with improving oral hygiene of the patients.Iinuma et al 41 investigated a population of community-dwelling elders in Japan. A total of 524 patients age 85+years were assessed over 36 months. The investigators found that nocturnal denture wear was significantly associated with a higher risk (OR=2.3) of pneumonia.Przybylowska et al 42 evaluate the composition of denture plaque biofilm on the oral mucosa in 51 patients, 37 diagnosed with COPD. Of these patients, 62% had complete dentures,24% had transitional RDPs, and 13.5% had metal-based RDPs.All control group patients had complete dentures. Bacterial Sampling was conducted on all patients. The investigators found pathogenic bacteria in 92% of the COPD patients. In addition,70.3% of the hospitalized patients had denture stomatitis witch. albicans infection. Abundant biofilm was detected in 27%of the COPD patients, but only in 7% of the control group. The Investigators concluded that poor oral hygiene in the denture-wearing COPD patient can lead to COPD-related events.Finally, Ortega et al 43 evaluated the oral health status of elderly patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia compared to a control group without swallowing difficulties. The investigators found that 40% of the dysphagia patients were edentulous, 16%of the patients had confirmation of aspiration into the lung tissues, 80% had signs of biofilm penetration into the larynx,and 32% had oropharyngeal residue of the denture biofilm.Ortega et al concluded that elderly patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia had a high risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.COPD (Table 7)In a prospective 5-year cohort study of 11,387 patients ages 45 to 64, Barros et al 44 studied the inflammatory biomarkers and COPD. They found an increase of IL-6 in the COPD patient cohort, and a significant pathogenic biofilm on dentures;these patients were found to be at higher risk for COPD-related events. Barros et al found that the completely edentulous patient cohort had a 2.37 times higher risk for COPD hospitalization and COPD-related death than the dentate or partially dentate cohorts (OR=2.37 for GOLD stage 1 and 2).Offenbacher et al,45in a cross-sectional study of 13,465 patients age 45 to 64 (of whom 2084 were completely edentulous)found that 28.3% of the edentulous patient cohort had COPDvs. 19.6% of the dentate patients. The risk (OR) of development of COPD in denture wearers was 1.3 times higher for GOLD stage 2 and 2.5 times higher for GOLD stage 3 COPD.Complete edentulism and cancer (Table 8)Cancer is the second-leading cause of mortality annually in the United States, resulting in nearly 585,000 deaths in 2011. Currently, the U.S. CDC reports that two of every three individuals diagnosed with cancer lives at least 5 years after their diagnosis. Of great interest to prosthodontists, cancer of the head and neck region (larynx, pharynx, and oral cavity) accounts for 12% of malignancies globally. An estimated 300,000 mortalities are annually associated with head and neck cancer. The Leading types of cancer, according to the U.S. CDC, are shown in Figure 5.Our previous report suggested that complete edentulism was related to various types of cancers, including lung, esophageal,and bladder cancer.9,46 Three additional studies have been found since our last publication. In the first, by Ansai et al,47656 Japanese community-dwelling participants were studied over 12 years, to determine if tooth loss was associated with oro-digestive cancer mortality. A significant association was found between tooth loss and cancer death; however, this became in-significant when adjusted for confounders. Survival rates were lowest in the completely edentulous cohort, especially for female denture wearers, when compared to the dentate cohorthaving 20 or more remaining teeth (p=0.047).Shakeri et al,48in a case-controlled study in Iran, studied 309 patients with confirmed diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma,and 613 age- and sex-matched controls. They found that participants with eight or more remaining teeth were more likely to have gastric cancer than those with fewer than 8 remaining teeth (OR=1.6), or those who were edentulous (OR=1.6);however, the authors reported there was insufficient evidence for a clear pattern of association between the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and oral health. Finally, in a similar study, Zeng et al 49 conducted a meta-analysis of 11 articles to determine the association between tooth loss and cancer of the head and neck region. They found a direct association between tooth loss and head and neck cancer.They reported that the loss of 6 to 15 teeth increases the risk(OR=1.58), the loss of 15 to 19 teeth increases the risk (OR=1.72), and the completely edentulous condition increases the risk even further (OR=1.89).Complete edentulism and cognitive impairment(Table 9)Cognitive disorders, also known as dementia, are characterized by memory impairment, as well as marked difficulty in speaking, motor activity, object recognition, and disturbance of executive function (ability to plan, organize, and abstract).Alzheimer’s Disease is the most common form of dementia.It is a progressive disease that begins with mild memory loss,and is thought to involve parts of the brain that control thought,memory, and language. The cause remains unclear. In 2013,up to 5 million adults had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in the United States. The number of individuals with the disease doubles every 5 years after the age of 65. By 2050, the number of affected individuals is projected to rise to 14 million, nearly threefold increase above current levels. The best-known risk factor is age, although genetics may play a role. Alzheimer’s,and other cognitive disorders, are the sixth leading cause of mortality in the United States. Nearly 84,767 deaths were reported to result from Alzheimer’s disease in 2011. In nursing homes in the United States, approximately 48.5% of patients have some level of this disease (U.S. CDC).In our previous work, we reported on the relationship between tooth loss and cognitive disorders that was first reported by Stein et al.10In a prospective longitudinal study of 144 Roman Catholic nuns in Milwaukee, WI, detailed dental records were managed by a single dental practitioner overa 40-year period. In addition, cognitive assessments were performed on the patients over a 12-year period. Finally, cranial tissues were obtained post-mortem, and analyzed by a trained neuropathologist blinded to the nuns’ cognitive function scores.The findings were impressive, as 22% of the study participants had one or more copies of the gene for Alzheimer’s. In addition,the investigators found a direct correlation between the incidence of dementia and the number of missing teeth. This initial publication has led to additional interest in the relationship between tooth loss and cognitive disorders since 2007.Okamoto et al 50 evaluated 2335 community-dwelling patients for memory loss as a function of tooth loss in a prospective 5-year clinical trial. They found that the completely edentulous patient experienced a greater decline in cognitive function when compared to the dentate cohort. The risk of decline in cognitive function was 2.39 times greater (OR=2.39) in the edentulous population. The risk of patients with 1 to 8 remaining teeth be-coming edentulous within 5 years was 4.68 times greater than that of patients with more teeth.Shakoor et al 51 examined 1210 patients with diagnosed dementia in a national cross-sectional study. They evaluated oral health, gait, and physical and cognitive impairment as a function of tooth loss. They reported that the incidence of falls increased 17% in the edentulous population (OR=1.58),and that the incidence of falls decreased for those edentulous patients who wore their dentures (OR=0.66) and for partially dentate patients (OR=0.59).Kisely et al 52 conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 2784 patients with severe mental illness and a control group of 31,084 patients. Nine studies were selected from 550 citations that met the inclusion criteria. The authors reported that the rate of complete edentulism varied from 3%(India) to 65% (England and Denmark). Patients with severe mental illness had a 3.4-time greater risk of being completely edentulous, and had 6.2 more decayed, missing, and filled surfaces than the control group.Nao Rungroj et al 53 used a subset of the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities study, a community-based study of vascular disease of 558 adult 52- to 75-year olds studied over 8 years. The Authors reported that 13.8% of the cohort was edentulous, and that there was a greater, but not clinically significant, decline in cognitive function in the edentulous cohort over the 8-year evaluation period. No causal effect could be determined.Paganini-Hill et al 54 evaluated the oral health and cognitive abilities of 5468 older community-dwelling adults with a mean age of 81 years over an 18-year period. The authors found that 90% of those patients with inadequate natural masticatory function were edentulous. The edentulous patients who didn't wear dentures demonstrated a 91% greater risk for dementia(HR=1.91) than those who were partially dentate. For the partially dentate cohort, poor oral hygiene resulted in a greater risk for dementia (22% to 65%) than those who performed proper brushing daily. The authors concluded that the wearing of removable prostheses appeared to be beneficial in terms of reducing the risk of dementia.Tsakos et al 55 evaluate cognitive function in 3166 community-dwelling adults 60+years of age. All assessments are done at baseline and at 5-year intervals (10 years to-tal). Completely edentulous patients were found to recall 0.88fewer words, and were 0.09 m/sec slower than partially dentate controls. The authors stated that complete edentulism was independently associated with cognitive decline and physical decline in older English adults, and that tooth loss may be a potential early marker of cognitive decline in the elderly.Zenthofer et al,56in a cross-sectional study, assessed oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) in institutionalized patients. They found that edentulous patients reported lower QoL scores than those with FDPs and RDPs, but higher than those who were edentulous and had no replacement dentures.Complete edentulism and mortality (Table 10)Current life expectancy in the United States is 78.8 years, and nearly 2.6 million deaths are reported annually, from a multitude of causes (U.S. CDC). In our 2009 paper, there were no reports of the relationship between complete tooth loss,edentulism, and mortality.9 Although several papers reviewed above 28,40,44,47 have discussed the relationship between tooth loss and mortality, several more deserve consideration.Brown 57 Provided one of the initial studies of the relationship between edentulism and mortality. In a cross-sectional survey of 41,000 adults 18+years of age. Mortality information was collected after 15 years. He found that 12.3% of the participants were completely edentulous (46% rate at 75+age cohort), and that complete edentulism that occurred before age 65 was associated with all-cause mortality. After adjustment for all confounders, the risk of death was 1.5 times greater for the edentulous patient than for the partially and fully dentate patient cohorts. An association between complete edentulism and cardiovascular mortality was also demonstrated.Holm-Pedersen et al 58 evaluated 573 nondisabled community-dwelling individuals at baseline, and at 5-year intervals for 20 years. They found that 40% of the entering participants were edentulous, and by 21 years, 88% had died.Edentulous patients had a statistically higher risk for mortality (HR=1.26) when compared to partially dentate patients.Holm Pedersen et al suggested that tooth loss was independently associated with mortality and that tooth loss may be an early predictor of accelerated aging.Osterberg et al 59 evaluated whether the number of teeth remaining at age 70 in a Swedish population influenced mortality. In their study of 1803 participants, they found that the 7-year mortality rates were highest in completely edentulous men (42% to 47%). They reported that the number of remaining teeth was an independent, significant 7-year predictor of mortality in both sexes: each remaining tooth reduced 7-year mortality by 4%. The number of remaining teeth was shown to be a significant predictor of mortality in the elderly,regardless of socioeconomic status, health factors, or lifestyle.Ansaietal60studied 656 patients over a 12-year period. They Found a significant association between cancer death and tooth loss (HR=1.03). Survival rates for female patients (only) were lowest in the edentulous patient cohort, and were statistically worse than those with 20 or more teeth.Janket et al 61 evaluated the role of removable prostheses on cardiovascular survival in a 15-year cross-sectional study. In 256 participants, they found that partially edentulous patients with an RDP had a lower risk for cardiovascular mortality than those who were fully dentate; however, those with complete dentures, or with a complete denture opposing an RDP hada higher risk of mortality. This study suggested that the periodontal health of the remaining teeth, if present, may influence cardiovascular survival; the authors suggested that reducing inflammation of remaining teeth and replacement of missing teeth appears to impact longevity.Polzer et al 62 conducted a systematic review in which 23studies were selected. They reported that a relationship existed between the number of remaining teeth and both circulatory and all-cause mortality; however, no study in their investigation demonstrated whether replaced teeth protect the patient againstmortality.In contrast, Schwahn et al 63 studied 1803 patients over a 10-year period to determine if missing, but un-replaced teeth had an effect on mortality. In their patient cohort, 188 had unreplaced missing teeth. They found that having nine or more-replaced teeth was directly related to all-cause mortality(OR=1.53) in this patient cohort; those patients with nine or more un-replaced teeth had a twofold increase for cardiovascular mortality. Interestingly, they demonstrated that an induction period of at least 9 years appears to be required for this relationship to develop. When adjusting for confounders, the OR forall-cause mortality was 1.43, and 1.88 for cardiovascular death.A reduced, but non replaced dentition appears to be associated with an increased risk for mortality.Watt et al64studied 12,831 participants for 8 years. After adjusting for confounders, edentulous participants demonstrated a significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (HR=1.3 generally, HR=1.49 for cardiovascular death mortality) compared to participants with natural teeth. Edentulous patients had a 2.97-time greater risk for mortality related to stroke. The authors concluded that being edentulous was shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease mortality.Finally, Liljestrand et al,65in cross-sectional study of 8446 patients in Finland, evaluated the dental status of their patient cohort at baseline and over the next 13 years. National registers were used to obtain information on various comorbidities and mortality. The authors reported that the edentulous patient was at increased risk for development of cardiovascular disease (HR=1.40), coronary heart disease (HR=1.5), diabetes mellitus(HR=1.56), and death (HR=1.68). In comparison to patient cohorts with remaining teeth, they were at the greatest risk for death. Conclusions According to the research found and evaluated in this study, it appears that:(1) Tooth loss, as well as complete edentulism, is associated with a multitude of systemic comorbid conditions.(2) The edentulous patient is at risk for reduced nutritional intake and for obesity.(3) Edentulous patients are at an increased risk of COPD-related events.(4) Poorly maintained removable prostheses may be associated with increases in pneumonia-related hospitalizations.(5) Tooth loss and complete edentulism may be associated with an increased risk of head and neck cancer.(6) The risk of decline in cognitive function appears to be greater in the edentulous population.(7) Edentulism is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease mortality.(8) A reduced, but non replaced dentition is associated with an increased risk for mortality.(9) Wearing of optimal removable prostheses may help protect patients against some types of comorbid disease conditions.(10) We need to educate patients and caregivers as to the potential long-term harmful outcomes of tooth extraction,and of poorly maintained removable prostheses.",-,"1.

The association between malnutrition and oral health status in elderly in long-term care facilities: A systematic review,"Aurélie Van Lancker, Soﬁe Verhaeghe, Ann Van Hecke, Katrien Vanderwee, Joline Goossens, Dimitri Beeckman","Objectives: Malnutrition is a common problem in the elderly. It is not clear if oral health is associated to malnutrition in this population. The aim of this systematic review is to determine whether an association exists between oral health and malnutrition in the elderly in a long-term care facility.Design: Systematic review.Data source: Medline, Cochrane and Cinahl were systematically searched for to identify articles published between January 1985 and May 2011. Reference lists were checked for additional publications.Review methods: Publications were included if they explored the association between oral health status and malnutrition. As no consensus about terminology was found, a sensitive ﬁlter was developed. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed. Two independent reviewers performed all methodological steps. Results: Sixteen studies met the criteria for inclusion. Eleven studies used a multivariate approach; nine of these found an association between oral health status and malnutrition. Four studies found a relationship between masticatory problems and malnutrition. Five studies found an association between malnutrition and dental condition, number of oral problems, tongue alteration, problems with saliva ﬂow, and candidiasis. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was medium.Conclusions: Tentative evidence indicates an independent association between oral health status and malnutrition in the elderly residing in a long-term care facility. Caution is needed for the interpretation of these results because of the absence of a gold standard to deﬁne and assess malnutrition and oral health status and the presence of methodological limitations throughout the studies.Keywords:Malnutrition, Oral health status, Elderly, Long-term care","What is already known about the topic?Malnutrition is a complex and multifactorial problem in
the elderly.Especially elderly residing in a long-term care facility are
vulnerable to malnutrition.Oral health status in elderly is poor, resulting in a
negative impact on quality of life. What this paper adds This review suggest an independent association between
oral health status and malnutrition.The methodological quality of studies covering this topic
is suboptimal, more high quality cohort studies are
needed.1. Introduction Malnutrition is an under-assessed and under-managed problem in the elderly population (Elia et al., 2005). Malnutrition can be deﬁned as: ‘A state of nutrition in
which a deﬁciency or excess (or imbalance) of energy,
protein and other nutrients causes measurable adverse
effects on tissue/body form, function and clinical outcome’
(Stratton et al., 2003). International studies report that 30–
90% of the hospitalised geriatric patients (Kaiser et al.,
2010; Kubrak and Jensen, 2007; Vanderwee et al., 2010),
30–50% of the institutionalised elderly (Kaiser et al., 2010;
Pauly et al., 2007; Soini et al., 2006; Stratton et al., 2003)
and 4.3–44% of the community dwelling older persons
(Cuervo et al., 2009; Kaiser et al., 2010; Stratton et al.,
2003) are malnourished. International variation in prevalence ﬁgures has been reported. This variation is due to (1)
differences in study population, (2) the use of different
deﬁnitions and (3) difference in methods to measure
malnutrition. Some studies only focused on patients with
malnutrition, others also included patients at risk for
malnutrition.The causes of malnutrition in the elderly are complex and
multifactorial. Malnutrition can be caused by a variety of
factors. These factors can be divided in two main groups: (1)
a lack of adequate availability, quality and presentation of
food, and (2) a reduced intake when food is available
(Stratton et al., 2003). Loss of appetite is probably the most
common cause of reduced food intake and results from
physical problems, mental health issues, intake of certain
drugs (such as opioids) or treatments (such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy) (Chen et al., 2007; Stratton et al., 2003).
Inadequate intake of ﬂuids and food can have harmful
consequences, will lead to poor health and can result in a
decreased quality of life in patients (Chen et al., 2001).
Research in older adults showed that malnutrition leads to
depression, a lower functional status, higher infection rates,
longer hospital stays, higher mortality rates and higher costs
for patient and society (Chen et al., 2007; Kubrak and Jensen,
2007; Stratton, 2007; Correia and Waitzberg, 2003). Nurses
play an important role in both screening of patients at risk of
malnutrition and referring them to adequate care (Chen
et al., 2007). Ageing is associated with a change in body composition,
loss of sensorimotor functioning, comorbidity and polypharmacy (Hickson, 2006). More speciﬁc, ageing is
associated with problems in oral health like loss of teeth,
oral dryness, periodontal diseases, caries, painful mucosal
disorders and decreased masticatory functioning (Petersen
and Yamamoto, 2005). Adequate oral health can be deﬁned
as: ‘A standard of health of the oral and related tissues
which enables an individual to eat, speak and socialize
without active disease, discomfort or embarrassment and
which contributes to general well-being’ (Department of
Health, 1994). A poor oral health status is especially
prevalent in elderly persons, as it results from cumulative
disease progression over time. A compromised health status and the use of multiple drugs are also important risk
factors for poor oral health, mainly occurring in the elderly
(Niessen and Fedele, 2002). The oral health status
inﬂuences the chewing ability, taste perception and the
capacity to swallow (Petersen and Yamamoto, 2005). The
negative impact of poor oral conditions on quality of life
has been demonstrated in plenty of studies and is an
important issue (Gerritsen et al., 2010; Naito et al., 2006).
Research shows that oral health in institutionalized elderly
is poor, mainly due to loss of independence in the elderly,
difﬁculty in accessibility and affordability of oral care (De
Visschere et al., 2006). Nurses are, beside dentists and
dental hygienists, responsible for the oral health care of
their patients. Moreover, nurses give low priority to oral
health care (Wardh et al., 2000).
To date, it is not clear if oral health status is associated
with malnutrition. A comprehensive understanding of the
existence of an association between oral health status and
malnutrition is important to implement prevention and
treatment interventions.
2. Aim The aim of this systematic review is to determine the
association between oral health status and malnutrition in
elderly residing in a long-term care facility.
3. Method
3.1. Search strategy
The electronic databases Medline, Cinahl and the
Library of the Cochrane Collaboration were used to search
for relevant articles between January 1985 and May 2011.
The search strategy consisted of a set of MeSH terms and
free text words subsequently combined. Following groups
of key words were introduced:
1) malnutrition, undernutrition, protein-energy malnutrition, nutritional status, nutritional assessment, nutritional disorders, sarcopenia;
2) homes for the aged, long term care, nursing homes,
health service for the aged, skilled nursing facilities,
intermediate nursing facilities, long-term care hospitals, aged, aged 80 and over, geriatric assessment;
3) oral health, oral hygiene, mouth, dental care.
The reference lists of all included articles were checked
for additional articles.
3.2. Selection criteria
Articles were included if they explored the association
between oral health status and malnutrition in elderly in
long-term care facilities. Study design was not deﬁned as
an exclusion criteria because of the exploratory character
of the review. Articles written in English, Dutch, French or
German were included.
Three reviewers (AVL, KV and JG) independently
screened the titles and abstracts based on the selection
criteria. If the abstract did not provide enough information to decide retrieved inclusion reviewers upon inclusion/exclusion, the full paper was
for further screening. Disagreement about or exclusion were discussed between the until consensus was reached.
3.3. Quality assessment
The methodological quality of each study was independently assessed by two reviewers (AVL and JG) using a
modiﬁed version of the Quality Assessment and Validity Tool
for Correlational Studies developed by Cummings et al.
(2008). The original tool is an adapted version of the
Estabrooks’ original Quality Assessment and Validity Tool for
Cross-Sectional Studies (Estabrooks et al., 2001, 2003, 2009;
Squires et al., 2011a,b). The tools of Estabrooks and
Cummings were previously used in several systematic
reviews (Baich et al., 2010; Cumming and Estabrooks,
2003; Cummings et al., 2008, 2010; Meijers et al., 2006; Salt
et al., 2008; Thungjaroenkul et al., 2007). The tool included
13 items to assess (1) research design, (2) sampling, (3)
measurement and (4) statistical analysis. Each item scored
one point if the criteria was met. The item related to
measurement of the dependent variable was scored 2 if it
was observed or measured independently, 1 for self-report
and 0 if the criteria was not met. The maximum score was 14.
Two adaptations were made for this review. The
adjustments, concerning the internal consistency and
theoretical framework, were approved by the ﬁrst author
of the tool. The item concerning the internal consistency of
the scale was modiﬁed, because not each instrument was
designed as a scale. Therefore, when the researchers
reported a consistent measurement according to a
standard, a score of 1 was given. The item on theoretical
framework was not applicable for this review, nevertheless
one point was counted for that item.
Discrepancies in the individual evaluations of the
reviewers were discussed until consensus was reached.
Based on this assessment three categories could be
deﬁned: low (0–4), medium (5–9) or high (10–14) quality.
Studies with a low quality score (0–4) were excluded from
this review.
3.4. Data abstraction and synthesis
Two reviewers (AVL and KV) independently extracted
data form the included articles and summarized the
ﬁndings in a standardized table of evidence (Table 4).
Inconsistencies were discussed. This standardized table
included following items: author and year of publication,
design, setting, sample, measurements and results.
There was an obvious heterogeneity between the
studies in relation to deﬁnition, measurement and
outcome of both dependent and independent variables;
no meta-analysis could be performed.
4. Results
4.1. Selected articles
A total of 2280 articles were identiﬁed: Medline
(n = 1658), Cinahl (n = 22) and the Cochrane Library
(n = 600). Duplicate articles (n = 522) were excluded. An
additional 1716 articles were excluded because the
inclusion criteria (based on title and/or abstract) were
not met. The full texts of 42 articles were reviewed in
detail. This review resulted in the exclusion of 25 articles
because the focus was not malnutrition or oral health
status (n = 6), the relationship between the variables was
not explored (n = 12) and another population under study
was involved (n = 7) (Fig. 1). No relevant articles were
added after checking the reference lists of the included
publications. The ﬁnal group of 17 articles were subjected
to a methodological quality assessment. All included
studies had a cross-sectional design and the number of
included patients varied between 40 and 3088.
4.2. Methodological quality
Details on the quality assessment of the included
articles are presented in Table 1. One study had a low
methodological quality score and was excluded (Horn
et al., 1994). Fifteen studies had a score between 5 and 9,
indicating medium quality. One study had a score of 10,
indicating high quality (Andersson et al., 2002).
4.3. Study characteristics
Different measures were used to assess nutritional
and oral health status in the patients under study. In
seven studies, malnutrition was assessed with one
measure (such as body mass index); in nine studies by
a combined measure (such as body mass index and serum
albumin level) (Table 2). Data about the nutritional status
were collected by ward nurses (Nordenram et al., 1996,
2001), an independently working physician (Dion et al.,
2007), trained ward nurses (Andersson et al., 2002, 2004;
Rauen et al., 2006; Soini et al., 2006) or external
investigators (Chai et al., 2006). Eight studies did not
provide information about this (Blaum et al., 1995; Griep
et al., 2000; Lamy et al., 1999; Mojon et al., 1999; Okada
et al., 2010; Paillaud et al., 2004; Sadamori et al., 2008;
Sullivan et al., 1993).
Oral health status was deﬁned differently throughout
the studies (Table 3). Data about oral health status were
collected by one dentist in ﬁve studies (Dion et al., 2007;
Lamy et al., 1999; Sullivan et al., 1993; Mojon et al., 1999;
Griep et al., 2000). Other studies reported data collection
by a dentist and a dental nurse (Nordenram et al., 2001), a
ward nurse (Soini et al., 2006), a trained ward nurse
(Andersson et al., 2002, 2004) or an investigator (Chai et al.,
2006; Sadamori et al., 2008). Five studies provided no
information (Blaum et al., 1995; Nordenram et al., 1996;
Okada et al., 2010; Paillaud et al., 2004; Rauen et al., 2006).
To assess the association between malnutrition and oral
health status, the researchers applied (1) correlation
analyses (Andersson et al., 2002, 2004; Griep et al.,
2000; Okada et al., 2010), (2) Pearson chi square analyses
(Lamy et al., 1999; Rauen et al., 2006; Soini et al., 2006), or
(3) other univariate analyses (Sadamori et al., 2008).
Multivariate analyses (Chai et al., 2006; Mojon et al., 1999)
or regression analyses (Andersson et al., 2002, 2004; Blaum
et al., 1995; Dion et al., 2007; Nordenram et al., 2001;
Okada et al., 2010; Paillaud et al., 2004; Sullivan et al.,
1993; Griep et al., 2000) were used in 11 studies. The
association between the variables was evaluated using
nutritional status or malnutrition as the dependent
variable and oral health status as the independent variable
in most studies (n = 13). One study evaluated oral health
status as both the dependent and the independent variable
(Okada et al., 2010). Two studies reported malnutrition as
the independent variable and oral health status as the
dependent variable (Andersson et al., 2004; Paillaud et al.,
2004).
The review revealed three groups of oral health
problems: (1) masticatory problems (also deﬁned as the
inability to chew, and oral dysfunction), (2) problems
related to dental condition (deﬁned as the number of
natural teeth, edentulism, and denture use), and (3) other
oral problems (deﬁned as the number of oral problems,
problems related to the tongue and saliva ﬂow, and oral
candidiasis). An overview of these results is provided in
Table 4.
4.4. Association between masticatory problems and
malnutrition
The association between masticatory problems and
malnutrition, was evaluated in seven studies (Blaum et al.,
1995; Dion et al., 2007; Lamy et al., 1999; Mojon et al.,
1999; Nordenram et al., 1996, 2001; Okada et al., 2010).
Four studies investigated the association between
masticatory problems and malnutrition at a univariate
level (Blaum et al., 1995; Mojon et al., 1999; Nordenram
et al., 2001; Lamy et al., 1999). Two of these studies found a
signiﬁcant association (Blaum et al., 1995; Nordenram
et al., 2001). One study reported a signiﬁcant association
between masticatory problems and BMI; however no
association was found between the level of serum albumin
(Mojon et al., 1999). Lamy and colleagues (1999) could not
conclude on an association.
Four studies used multivariate analysis. Masticatory
problems were identiﬁed as the independent predictor for
low BMI and level of serum albumin, weight loss and
protein energy malnutrition; with reported odds ratios
between 1.01 and 1.52 (Blaum et al., 1995; Dion et al.,
2007; Nordenram et al., 2001; Okada et al., 2010). One
study found no signiﬁcant association at multivariate level
(Nordenram et al., 1996).
4.5. Association between dental condition and malnutrition
The association between dental condition and malnutrition was evaluated in seven studies (Chai et al., 2006;
Griep et al., 2000; Lamy et al., 1999; Mojon et al., 1999;
Rauen et al., 2006; Sadamori et al., 2008; Soini et al., 2006).
All studies found a signiﬁcant association at univariate
level with malnutrition as the dependent variable.
However, in two studies an association could only be
determined between edentulism and (1) BMI (Mojon et al.,
1999), and (2) MNA score (Lamy et al., 1999). No signiﬁcant
association was found between dental condition and the
level of the serum albumin (Lamy et al., 1999; Mojon et al.,
1999). The study of Sadamori et al. (2008) reported an
association between dental condition and the level of the
serum albumin; however not with BMI. In the study by
Chai and colleagues (2006), using multivariate analyses,
dental condition was found to be associated with being
malnourished (OR 3.00; 95% CI 1.12–8.06; p < 0.05 (Chai
et al., 2006). This conclusion was not found in the study by
Griep et al. (2000).
4.6. Association between other oral problems and
malnutrition
Two studies found an signiﬁcantly association between
the number of oral problems and malnutrition at univariate (Soini et al., 2006) and multivariate (Sullivan et al.,
1993) level.
Two studies, focused on a wide variety of oral problems
(Andersson et al., 2002, 2004). In 2002, Andersson and
colleagues found a weak association at multivariate level
between malnutrition and (1) problems related to the
tongue (r = 0.22; p < 0.001), and (2) saliva ﬂow (r = 0.16;
p < 0.019). The same study found that a problem with the
saliva ﬂow was a predictor for malnutrition (OR 0.06; 95%
CI 0.00–0.086; p < 0.039). The 2004 study found that
malnutrition was an independent predictor for tongue
alterations (OR 4.4; 95% CI 2.0–9.6; p < 0.0005) and a
reduced saliva low (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.3–5.4; p < 0.007)
(Andersson et al., 2004).
Paillaud et al. (2004) found that the level of serum
albumin was independently associated with candidiasis
(OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.0–1.7; p = 0.044) at multivariate level.
5. Discussion
The aim of this review was to determine the
existence of an association between oral health status and malnutrition in elderly residing in long-term care
facilities. Multiple studies reported the existence of this
association. However, conclusions should be interpreted
carefully as studies used cross-sectional designs and no
causality could be determined (rival hypotheses could not
be ruled out). Moreover, a wide variety of deﬁnitions,
measurements, methods and outcomes were used to
identify oral health – and nutritional status.
In total, 16 studies met the criteria for inclusion. More
than half of the studies (n = 11) applied multivariate
techniques to identify an independent association between oral health and nutritional status (Andersson et al.,
2002, 2004; Blaum et al., 1995; Chai et al., 2006; Dion et al.,
2007; Griep et al., 2000; Nordenram et al., 1996, 2001;
Okada et al., 2010; Paillaud et al., 2004; Sullivan et al.,
1993). Nine of these did conclude the existence of the
association. Four studies determined a signiﬁcant association between masticatory problems and malnutrition
(Blaum et al., 1995; Dion et al., 2007; Nordenram et al.,
2001; Okada et al., 2010). Three studies reported on an
association between malnutrition and incomplete denture
(Chai et al., 2006), number of oral problems (Sullivan et al.,
1993) and saliva ﬂow (Andersson et al., 2002). The latter
examined oral health as an independent predictor for
malnutrition. Two additional studies examined the opposite association and found that malnutrition was associated with the presence of oral candidiasis (Paillaud et al.,
2004), alteration to the tongue and a lower saliva ﬂow
(Andersson et al., 2004). However, it should be noted that
malnutrition was deﬁned and measured differently across
all studies. The absence of a gold standard to deﬁne and
assess malnutrition is a major problem. Consequently, it is
difﬁcult to compare the results and to report on a
conclusive association.
Multiple researchers indicated the failure to recognize
the nutritional status by using one single indicator (such as
BMI or serum albumin level) (Arrowsmith, 1999; Klein
et al., 1997). Eight studies deﬁned nutritional status as a
result of multiple indicators. Eight studies used one single
indicator to deﬁne if a patient was malnourished. Multiple
limitations are related to the use of a single indicator, such
as the absence of an agreed in cut-off score and the
presence of confounding factors, such as edema and
inﬂammation (which may inﬂuence BMI, weight loss
and serum albumin level) (Ahmed and Haboubi, 2010;
Beck and Ovesen, 1998; Omran and Morley, 2000).
5.1. Methodological limitations
In general, the methodological quality of the included
studies was medium. One study had a low quality score;
being the reason for exclusion (Horn et al., 1994). The
absence of prospective study designs, non-probability
sampling techniques, multicentre studies, description of
validity and reliability of the dependent and the independent variable, and reporting about how outliers were
analyzed, were the most commonly reported methodological limitations.
The study of Griep et al. (2000) and Nordenram et al.
(1996), which could not detect an association at multivariate level, were found to have the most methodological limitations. These studies found an association at univariate level, but were not able to report this association at
multivariate level, possibly linked to a small number of
malnourished persons or an overall small sample size.
Some studies (n = 7) included confounding factors, such
as age and care dependency in the multivariate model.
However, other factors, not being identiﬁed, could still
cause over- or under-estimation of the association
between oral health status and malnutrition. Alternative
designs, such as a prospective cohort study with comparable groups and statistical control of the potentially
intervening variables, are recommended (Bachman, 2011).
5.2. Association and underlying mechanisms
The association between poor oral health and malnutrition in elderly people can mainly be clariﬁed by teeth
loss. Teeth loss and a decreased chewing efﬁciency is more
common in this group, mainly because of the ageing
process and the higher occurrence of periodontal diseases
(Russell and Ship, 2008). Teeth loss is likely to reduce
masticatory ability and causes more difﬁculties when
eating (Joshipura et al., 1996). In addition, it is well
established that the use of a partial or complete denture as
substitute for natural teeth can lead to chewing problems
(Budtz-Jorgensen et al., 2001). This may increase the risk of
being malnourished (Budtz-Jorgensen et al., 2001). Moreover, saliva plays an important role in the masticatory
process. The lubricative function of saliva allows moistening of food and support the creation of a food bolus which
facilitates the ability to chew (Budtz-Jorgensen et al.,
2001). Despite the fact that evidence concerning the
relation between a decrease of saliva production and
ageing is conﬂicting, it is known that a reduction in saliva
production is caused by systemic diseases and their
treatment (Turner and Ship, 2007). Consequently, as
elderly residing in a long-term care facility are more
affected by systemic diseases and polypharmacy, they are
more vulnerable for a reduced saliva ﬂow (Besdine, 2009).
Malnutrition leads to nutrient deﬁciency, resulting in
reduced cytokines and more periodontal diseases, such as
oral candidiasis. In addition, malnutrition leads to a
reduced salvia volume resulting in alterations of the
tongue (Enwonwu, 1995).
5.3. Implication for practice
Despite the fact that no causal relationship could be
determined, efforts should be made to improve both oral
health and nutritional status in the elderly. Studies
indicate that nurses and physicians attach low priority
to oral care and nutritional care in long-term care facilities
(Wardh et al., 2000; Costello and Coyne, 2008; Elia et al.,
2005; Cowan et al., 2004). The main reasons are
misconceptions and neglect concerning the importance
of oral care and nutritional care, lack of knowledge and
resistance against oral cleansing and feeding activities
(Wardh et al., 2000; Costello and Coyne, 2008; Elia et al.,
2005; Cowan et al., 2004). Attitude and knowledge related
to screening, prevention and treatment of oral health
problems and nutritional status should be improved through training and education of professional caregivers
(Nicol et al., 2005; Suominen et al., 2009).
Oral care starts with the incorporation of an oral
assessment on admission and re-evaluation on a regular
basis. To prevent loss of natural teeth, nurses should
support patients and their family in performing interventions aimed at oral care. Mouth cleansing and teeth/
denture brushing must be done at least once a day (Attin
and Hornecker, 2005). Nurses also play a key role in
referring the elderly to the general practitioner or dental
care. Dental care is important to maintain natural teeth
and the function of the dentition. This care should be
individualized (Petersen and Yamamoto, 2005). The
inclusion of a dentist as part of the interdisciplinary team
is recommended. The introduction of a protocol may
support the interdisciplinary team in preventing and
treating oral problems.
An association was also found between malnutrition
and oral health status. Therefore, it is equally important to
improve nutritional care in the elderly. Firstly, an
international organization should take the lead in
introducing and implementing a universal deﬁnition
and standard to assess malnutrition (Kubrak and Jensen,
2007). Researchers previously advised to use at least two
indicators or a validated assessment instrument, including multiple indicators, to evaluate the nutritional status
(Arrowsmith, 1999; Klein et al., 1997). The ESPEN
guideline for Nutrition Screening 2002 (Kondrup et al.,
2003) recommends using the Mini Nutritional Assessment as it is a validated and widely used tool in
institutionalized elderly (Green and Watson, 2006). An
assessment of the nutritional status should be performed
on admission and re-evaluation on a regular basis is
required. Malnutrition is a complex and multifactorial
problem requiring a holistic approach for prevention and
treatment. Most commonly, malnutrition is caused by a
low quality and presentation of food and a reduced intake
when food is available (Stratton et al., 2003). Nutritional
support should be individualized and may include:
assistance in feeding, quality food, oral nutritional
supplements, enteral tube feeding or parenteral nutrition
(Stratton et al., 2003). The introduction of a standardized
nutrition evidence based protocol could support the
institution and the professional caregivers to improve
the nutritional status of the elderly.
6. Conclusion
This review gives an overview of the literature
determining the association between oral health status
and malnutrition in the elderly residing in a long-term
care facility. Tentative evidence suggests that oral health
status and malnutrition are independently associated.
Despite this fact, caution is needed in the interpretation of
these results as the studies had some methodological
limitations. Attention should be paid to a good oral health
status and nutritional status in the elderly. Future
research is recommended, as it seems necessary to
introduce high quality cohort studies to determine a
causal relationship between oral health status and
malnutrition. Acknowledgements

Tooth Loss Strongly Associated With Malnutrition in Chronic Kidney Disease,"E. Ioannidou, H. Swede,†G. Fares,‡and J. Himmelfarb","Background:In chronic kidney disease (CKD), inadequate nutritional intake, inflammation, and increased oxidative stress have been the major contributing factors in malnutrition pathogenesis. However, there is still a paucity of evidence assessing the magnitude of the effect of tooth loss on malnutrition in CKD populations. The authors hypothesized that among patients with CKD, tooth loss may affect nutritional status, using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988 to 1994 (NHANES III).Methods:Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated based on cystatin C levels using the relevant equation. Urinary Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (albuminuria) was calculated in milligrams per gram with a cutoff point of 30 mg/g. CKD was defined based on estimated GFR<60 mL/minute/1.73m 2 and albuminuria‡30 mg/g. The cutoff point for serum albumin was set at 3.7 g/dL. Tooth loss categories were based on the number of missing and replaced teeth.Results:A total of 2,749 patients was included and stratified based on their oral health status. There was a statistically significant correlation between tooth loss and the proportion of patients with low protein and caloric intake (P=0.02 and0.01, respectively). Serum albumin reached a frequency peak in the fully edentulous group without dentures (group4, 19.2%). In the same group, individuals had lower protein(30.1%) and caloric intake (30.2%) (P=0.01 and 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, logistic regression analysis confirmed the significant role of tooth loss on serum albumin and protein and energy intake in this population even after adjusting for confounding variables.Conclusion:Tooth loss independently predicts low energy and protein intake, as well as serum albumin levels, biomarkers of malnutrition in CKD.J Periodontol 2014;85:899-907.KEY WORDS Malnutrition; nutrition surveys; renal insufficiency, chronic;tooth loss.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by protein–energy malnutrition and chronic inflammation, as well as high rates of cardiovascular mortality described as the malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis syndrome.1 The prevalence of this syndrome in CKD ranges from 18% to 75%.2 Several mechanisms, including inadequate nutritional intake, inflammation, increased oxidative stress, and increased catabolic response, have been established as the major contributing factors in malnutrition pathogenesis in CKD.3-5 Uremia and uremic toxins inhibit the intake of carbohydrates, proteins, and nutritional solutions, causing anorexia, the loss of desire to eat.6Ad-additionally, inflammatory cytokines act directly on peripheral sites as well as the hypothalamus by inhibiting appetite.6 Inflammatory cytokines have been shown to trigger apoptosis and down-regulate production of albumin mRNA by the liver, leading to reduced synthesis and increased albumin catabolism and vascular permeability.7,Metabolic acidosis commonly associated with CKD is another mechanism that irreversibly stimulates protein degradation, also leading to low albumin levels.9 Moreover, psychological factors such as depression have been implicated in inadequate caloric intake in CKD.10Asa result, malnutrition is an important focus in CKD management as confirmed by the guidelines established by the National Kidney Foundation.11 Although uremia is known to affect appetite regulation b12and taste (uremic hypogeusia),13 there is a paucity of evidence in the nephrology literature assessing the magnitude of tooth loss on malnutrition in the CKD population.Poor oral health leading to tooth loss directly affects chewing capacity and mastication forces, resulting in reduced nutritional intake and poor nutritional status.14-18 The authors hypothesize that among patients with CKD, tooth loss and poor oral health may affect nutritional status. This hypothesis was examined in a large, representative CKD sample of the United States population using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988 to 1994 (NHANES III).19 MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Population NHANES, a periodic survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),provides cross-sectional national estimates of health and nutritional status of the civilian, non-institutionalized population.19 Individuals participate in interviews conducted at home and in extensive physical examinations, including blood and urine collection, performed at an examination center.NHANES III was conducted in two phases: 1988 to 1991 and 1991 to 1994. The protocols of NHANES were approved by the National Center for Health Statistics institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.19This study includes patients: 1) with CKD; 2)>30 years; and 3) with no missing relevant variables such as oral examination, medical, and laboratory data.Information on age, sex, race, and smoking history was based on self-report during the survey interview.A binary age variable was constructed using a cutoff point of 60 years based on risk assessment for CKD.20Smoking status was determined using the answers to the questions: ‘‘Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life?’’ and ‘‘Do you smoke cigarettes?’’ Individuals who answered ‘‘no’’ to both questions were considered never-smokers. Individuals who answered ‘‘yes’’ to both questions were considered current smokers, whereas the ones, who only answered ‘‘yes’’ to the first question, were considered past-smokers. Additionally, diabetes was defined based on the answer to the question:‘‘Have you been told by your doctor that you have diabetes?’’ Glycated hemoglobin was used as an indicator of diabetes control, with a cutoff of 6.5%.21A variable for diabetes duration was constructed using a previously used cut point of 10 years.22 Education and income variables were constructed as reported previously,23 whereas body mass index(BMI) was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by squared height (m2) and was stratified into five standard categories: low (<18.5), normal (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25.0 to 29.9), obese (30.0 to 34.9), and morbidly obese (‡35.0).24 Tooth Loss Definition Tooth loss has been considered a tangible, true endpoint 25 and indicator of poor oral health. The fully dentate status represents 28 natural teeth rather than 32 teeth, since third molars were not included in NHANES III dental examination protocols.The five categories used for tooth loss and replacement stratification were: group 0=complete natural dentition; group 1=complete mixed dentition (natural teeth and replaced teeth); group 2=incomplete (natural or mixed) dentition; group 3=fully edentulous with full dentures; and group 4=fully edentulous with no dentures.26 Further, in the regression analyses, tooth loss was represented by number of missing teeth used as a continuous variable.Denture Type Full or partial denture was defined based on the denture type variables of the NHANES examination file for maxillary and mandibular teeth.Diet Dietary data were extracted from the NHANES III dietary surveys including the food frequency questionnaire and the 24-hour dietary recall. Variables were constructed representing the protein and energy intake with a cutoff point of 1.2 g/kg/day and 30 kcal/kg/day, respectively, as determined by CKD guidelines.11 Kidney Function Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on cystatin C levels has been shown to be independent of age and race, contrary to estimated GFR based on serum creatinine levels.27th Us, GFR was estimated based on cystatin C levels using the equation 76.7·cystatin C-1.19.27 eGFR is reported in mL/minute/1.73m2. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (albuminuria) was calculated in milligrams per gram with a cutoff point of 30 mg/g.28 All eGFR values>200 mL/minute/1.73m2 were truncated at that level.28 CKD Definition CKD was defined based on the recent classification that combined eGFR values<60 mL/minute/1.73m 2 and albuminuria‡30 mg/g.20 Cutoff points for CKD stages followed the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative.20 More Specifically, the CKD cutoff points are described as:Stage 1 (eGFR>90 mL/minute/1.73m 2 and albuminuria); Stage 2 (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/minute/1.73m 2 and albuminuria); Stage 3A1 (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/minute/1.73m 2 and no albuminuria); Stage 3A2(eGFR 30 to 59 mL/minute/1.73m 2 and albuminuria); Stage 4A1 (eGFR<30 mL/minute/1.73m2 no albuminuria); and Stage 4A2 (eGFR<30 mL/minute/1.73m 2 and albuminuria).20 Serum Albumin Levels Because serum albumin has been reported as a reli-able systemic marker of malnutrition,29a dichotomous variable was constructed representing serum albumin levels with a cutoff point of 3.7 g/dL based on the current definition for malnutrition in CKD.11 Statistical Analyses Analyses were performed using statistical software with a complex sample module incorporating sampling weights in the NHANES dataset.30 Categorical Variables were tested with the Pearson X2 Test, and continuous variables were tested with they-test for independent samples. Three logistic regression analyses were applied in the population: crude model(unadjusted); model 1: adjusted for age, sex, andrace; and model 2 (full model) based on previous evidence 28,31,32 fully adjusted for age, sex, race,diabetes status, BMI, smoking, CKD status, denturestatus, education, and income. A non-automated stepwise regression model was used to assess the association of tooth loss (used as a continuous variable) with serum albumin as well as protein and energy intake. Sequence relevant confounders were added to produce the full model. For the categorical confounding variables, odds ratios (ORs) and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) were presented. For tooth loss, OR and 95% CI were calculated for every five teeth lost. More specifically, aged<60 years, femalesex, non-Hispanic white race, absence of diabetes,normal BMI, CKD Stage 1A1, never-smoker status,natural dentition, high income, and education>12 years were used as referents in the regression models. Given the effect of decreased kidney function on malnutrition,33 an exploratory analysis was performed on the effect modification of CKD status and tooth loss on the dependent variables.P Values of<0.05 were accepted as statistically significant in all analyses.RESULTS Descriptive Analyses Of the total NHANES III study population (39,695),2,749 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Descriptive characteristics of the study sample stratified by tooth loss status are presented in Table 1. An Overall descriptive analysis showed that the more missing teeth, the higher the proportion of patients with low protein and caloric intake. Albumin, a bio-marker of malnutrition, reached a frequency peak(19.2%) in group 4, characterized by fully edentulous individuals without dentures. Also, when comparing number of missing teeth in groups 1 and 2, individuals in group 2 were found to have statistically significant more missing teeth than individuals in category 1 (P=0.001).When observing the fully dentate group 0 (405 patients), which represents the group with the best oral health status, most of the individuals were never-smokers with normal BMI, low diabetes prevalence,and medium income as well as dental visits that were not erratic. The demographics of this group predominantly revealed mainly non-Hispanic white patients aged<60 years.In group 1 (867 patients), which was characterized by mixed dentition with mean tooth loss of2.1 teeth, the patients were predominantly non-Hispanic white, aged<60 years, with normal BMI and low diabetes prevalence. Furthermore, this group had a low frequency of reduced protein and caloricintake.Group 2 (886 patients) was characterized by in-complete natural dentition and no replaced teeth,with mean tooth loss of 5.9 teeth. In this group,the demographics revealed higher frequency of patients aged>60 years (25.2%), predominantly non-Hispanic white. This group was characterized by higher frequency of low protein and caloric intake compared with groups 0 and 1.The behavioral and socio economic descriptive analysis revealed that groups 0 to 2 were characterized by medium income, and in a majority, good perception of health and>12 years of education.These findings positively correlated with oral health status as shown in Table 1.Group 3 (543 patients who were fully edentulous with full dentures) was aged>60 years (78.9%) and mainly a non-Hispanic white population. In this group, 64.4% had low income and 56.0% had<12 years of education. More importantly, this group was characterized by the high proportion of patients with serum albumin<3.7 g/dL (17.5%). The vast majority of this group included overweight or obese patients as assessed by BMI, as well as patients with erratic dental visits (95.2%).Group 4 (48 patients who were fully edentulous without full dentures) showed a high prevalence of individuals older than 60 years old. Of the patients with diabetes, 80.4% had the disease>10 years.Almost 50% of the individuals in this group were current smokers. Most of the patients in the group belonged to the low-income category (95.5%), witheducation<12 years (67%) and erratic dental visits(96.7%). Multivariate Models In the multivariate logistic regression model with serum albumin as a dependent variable (Table 2),missing teeth emerged as a significant predictor (P=0.0001), which sustained significance in the full model 2(P=0.001) adjusting for denture status as well as all relevant confounders. When examining the confounding factors, model 1 confirmed the significant role of age (OR=1.91, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.91), sex (OR=2.62, 95% CI 1.82 to 3.78), and race (OR=2.91, 95%CI 2.07 to 4.08) in this association. In model 2, age and race sustained significance and BMI appeared as a significant predictor as expected. When the biologic effect of CKD status on serum albumin was tested in interaction with tooth loss, the interaction showed a trend to significance (P=0.10). In a sub-group analysis, tooth loss was a significant predictor in CKD Stage 3A2 (P=0.007) (data not shown).In the logistic regression model in which caloric intake was used as a dependent variable (Table 3),tooth loss emerged as a significant predictor (P=0.0001) and sustained statistical significance in all models (P=0.03 and=0.01 in models 1 and 2,respectively) after adjusting for denture status. When Examining the confounding factors, sex appeared significant in model 1 and lost significance in model 2, whereas diabetes and BMI were significant predictors in model 2 (Table 3). When the biologic effect of CKD as a modifier of the model was tested in interaction terms with tooth loss, the interaction did not appear significant (P=0.29) (data not shown).Furthermore, in the logistic regression model in which protein intake was the dependent variable,number of missing teeth emerged as a statistically significant predictor in the crude analysis (P=0.03),model 1 (P=0.01), and the full model 2 (P=0.02)(Table 4). When assessing the confounding factors,sex was a significant predictor in model 1 and sustained significance in model 2 together with BMI(Table 4). When interaction between CKD status and tooth loss was tested, the results did not reach significance (data not shown).Further, ORs and 95% CIs were calculated for every five teeth lost, and in all models the variable maintained significance (Tables 2 through 4). Overall, the regression models confirmed the impact of tooth loss on the dietary intake in this population.DISCUSSION This is the first study of a nationally representative sample of the United States population to show that poor oral health status independently predicted malnutrition in patients with CKD after controlling for confounding factors. For the first time in CKD populations, the current authors showed that the more teeth lost, the worse the dietary intake. In the mixed dentition group (group 1), in which missing teeth were replaced by partial dentures or fixed crowns, the dietary intake was similar to the reference group of good oral health, confirming the importance of chewing function. The fully edentulous group without full dentures (group 4) showed the highest proportion of patients with low protein and caloric intake due to the compromised chewing capacity.These results are also consistent with previous studies in the general population where individuals with fewer teeth tend to have compromised nutrient intake as well as compromised general nutritional status.34 Furthermore, dental status has been shown to affect eating ability 35 as shown by reduced protein and energy.Malnutrition in CKD is a complex phenomenon that may be mediated by several biologic mechanisms, including uremic toxicity, systemic inflammation, and central anorexia.36 Others factors such as depression, use of appetite-suppressing medications, and behavioral factors influencing the desire to eat have been reported as contributing to anorexia in CKD.12 The present study is the first population-based study examining the effect of chewing ability on nutritional intake and biomarkers of malnutrition in CKD. Thus, these data extend the understanding of the factors that contribute adversely to nutritional status in individuals with CKD.Although serum albumin had been widely accepted as a marker of malnutrition in the past, more recently hypoalbuminemia is also recognized to be a manifestation of systemic inflammation. For example, even in extreme conditions such as starvation marasmus, serum albumin levels remain normal.The direct relationship of albumin with malnutrition becomes manifest only in extremely deficient dietary-complicated conditions that also have an inflammatory component, such as kwashiorkor.7,37 Inflammatory disorders have a contributing role in the liver by decreasing albumin synthesis affected by acute-phase proteins as well as interleukin-138andby increasing albumin catabolism.33 The current results confirm the effect of poor oral health, evident by tooth loss, on hypoalbuminemia even after controlling for other confounders.In this study, group 4 overwhelmingly represents elderly individuals with longstanding and poorly controlled diabetes, high proportion of current smokers, erratic dental visits, and more advanced CKD stages. In this extreme group, one could extrapolate the results and anticipate a natural history of tooth loss when the patients progress to dialysis stage.Based on this study, the authors propose two potential mechanisms that could link oral health status to malnutrition and inflammation in CKD: 1)a direct pathway in which tooth loss could directly affect nutritional intake; and 2) an indirect pathway through which the systemic inflammatory response caused by oral infections such as periodontitis could elicit a combination of positive and negative acute-phase proteins by the liver, promoting protein catabolism and contributing to malnutrition.A limitation of this study is the cross-sectional design that prevented the assessment of temporal or causal relationships. Moreover, the NHANES data prevent us from assessing direct chewing capacity as measured by occluding tooth pairs. To overcome this limitation, the authors focused on evaluating the impact of tooth loss on nutritional intake after adjusting for partial or full dentures. Additionally, this study includes only predialysis CKD populations because of NHANES III database limitations. Given That malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis has been a highly important disorder in hemodialysis,one would expect more pronounced oral health–malnutrition associations in hemodialysis populations. Hence, further research addressing the oral health role on malnutrition–inflammation would be necessary in patients undergoing hemodialysis. At The pre dialysis stage, the effect of oral health status on progression of CKD and prevention of malnutrition would be an essential field of interest. Long-term prospective studies as well as interventional studies are needed to fully assess the possible causal relationships among oral health status,malnutrition, and systemic inflammation in the CKD population.CONCLUSIONS This study specifically highlights the critical role of oral health on malnutrition in CKD. Furthermore, it shows that poor oral health as manifested by tooth loss predicts reduced nutritional and caloric intake in CKD.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) grant K23DE018689 (Bethesda, Maryland) awarded to E.

Tooth loss and chewing capacity among older adults in Adelaide,"Gary D. Slade, A. John Spencer and Kaye Roberts-Thomson","This study aimed to identify sociodemographic factors associated with edentulism (loss of all teeth) and the average number of teeth lost, and to investigate relationships between tooth loss and chewing capacity. Data were obtained in 1991-92 from a cross sectional oral epidemiological survey of Adelaide residents aged 60t years. Interviews with 1160 participants provided information on edentulism while oral examinations among 560 dentate participants and 313 edentulous participants provided information on the number of missing teeth. People were asked if they could chew or bite six common foods. Some 41.1 percent of persons were edentulous, and nearly half the natural teeth (mean 15.2) were missing among dentate people. Multivariate analyses revealed higher rates of edentulism (PIO.05) for people who were older, female, Australian-born, or holders of pensioner health benefit cards, and for people who left school at an early age, or who did not own their residence. Among dentate people there were more (PI 0.05) missing teeth among those who were older, Australian-born, health benefit card holders, and who left school at an early age. Some 37.9 percent of people reported difficulty chewing at least one food, although 57 per cent of dentate people and virtually all edentulous people wore dentures. Difficulty chewing was associated with tooth loss: 6.1 per cent of people with fewer than nine missing teeth reported difficulty compared with S8.6 percent of edentulous people (P < 0.01). The findings show sub- Stan tially compromised oral health among older adults, particularly the oldest-old and disadvantaged groups. (Aust J Public Health 1996; 20: 76-82)","DECLINING rates of tooth loss among adults, coupled with reductions in dental caries among children, create an impression of widespread improvements in oral health within the Australian population. Findings from the 1987-88 National Oral Health Survey of Australia led to the conclusion that year 2000 oral health targets would be achieved for children (no more than 1.0 decayed, missing or filled teeth per child) and for older adults (no more than 40 per cent of people aged 65 years and over with total tooth loss) .l Nonetheless, older adults have been recognised as a group likely to experience poor oral health due to a legacy of past tooth loss coupled with recurring episodes of dental decay and periodontal diseases.2 Previous Australian studies of adults confirm the declining prevalence of tooth loss and also reveal higher age-specific rates of edentulism (loss of all teeth) among women.gg Nonetheless, the 1987-88 national survey found that 41 per cent of men and 5'7 per cent of women aged 65 and over were edentulous, and that dentate persons in that age group had an average of 17.4 missing teeth.' There was less information about socioeconomic variations in tooth loss, although linkage of the survey data to geographic socioeconomic characteristics revealed higher rates of edentulism and a larger mean number of missing teeth among groups with lower educational attainment.l0 However, the socioeconomic inequalities were less apparent among people aged 65 years and over than among younger age groups. Earlier surveys conducted in Adelaide,* Brisbane' and Melbourne 8 found socioeconomic inequalities in edentulism, although those studies did not include specific analysis of older adults. Only two previous Australian reports have examined edentulism and missing teeth specifically within age groups of the population aged 60 years and over,~.~ and the one study that examined socioeconomic variations among older adults was confined to residents of collective living centre^.^ High levels of tooth loss represent a particular hazard for older adults because of the likely effect of tooth loss on chewing and oral function, yet epidemiological surveys traditionally have not assessed the impact of oral disorders. Many older adults compensate for missing teeth by wearing dentures, although there has been long standing recognition that dentures provide less efficient function than natural teeth."" While there is concern that diminished chewing capacity could lead to a poor diet, there has been no clear evidence of nutritional inadequacy among older adults with tooth loss.'* However, there is evidence that the qualitative nature of the diet is different, with softer foods being consumed by people who rely on dentures.13 Furthermore, researchers in the United Kingdom have found that reduced chewing capacity can contribute to a sense of embarrassment and reduce the enjoyment of eating for edentulous older ad~1ts.l~ This paper aimed to determine the prevalence of and sociodemographic factors associated with edentulism and missing teeth among a representative sample of rio institutionalized persons aged 60 and over living in Adelaide. A secondary aim was to investigate relationships between levels of tooth loss and reported chewing capacity. Methods This paper reports on data obtained from the baseline phase of the South Australian Dental Longitudinal Study: an oral epidemiological study of people aged 60 years and over in Adelaide and Mt Gambier. The study design precluded edentulous persons in Mt Gambier, and consequently this paper is confined to the Adelaide subsample. The baseline survey was conducted between July 1991 and March 1992. Subjects were selected at random from a stratified sample of persons listed on the electoral database maintained by the South Australian Electoral Commission, a compulsory register for Australian citizens aged 18 years and over. People aged 60 and over in the Adelaide Statistical Division were sampled from 18 strata defined by three age groups, two sexes and three locality categories. Each sampled person was visited at his or her residence by ap inter- viewer. Up to six visits were made to each residence to locate sampled persons, and uncontacted addresses were revisited two months later. When subjects were contacted, a fourth level of stratification was used to select all dentate people and a random subset of edentulous people. This was done to avoid oversampling edentulous persons. An additional criterion was used at the time of contact to exclude any persons living in nursing homes or hospitals (but not hostels for the aged). Interviews Sampled people who agreed to participate in the survey took part in a face-to-face interview containing 72 questions about dental health status, use of dental services, preventive practices, residential history, sociodemographic characteristics and medical conditions. For the latter, people were asked if a doctor had ever diagnosed ten different medical conditions: asthma, chronic bronchitis, hypertension, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, cataracts, osteoporosis, and cancer. Another question asked about capacity to chew six f00ds.l~ People were asked Are you ordinarily able to: chew boiled vegetables; chew hamburger; chew fresh lettuce salad; chew a piece of fresh carrot; chew firm meat such as steak or chops; bite off and chew a piece from a whole fresh apple? Oral examinations Interviewed people were invited to take part in an oral examination conducted by one of four dentists who had been trained and assessed for reliability in the use of oral epidemiological indices. For edentulous people, the oral mucosa was examined and dentures were inspected. For dentate people, mirrors and probes were used under standardised illumination to assess the status of teeth and periodontal tissues following the National Institute of Dental Research protocol.16 No radiographs were taken. All teeth were categorised as present or miss ing. The presumed reasons for tooth loss were not recorded. However, teeth were coded separately as tooth roots if they were severely broken down, with more than three quarters of the natural or restored coronal structure missing (for example because of decay or fracture). Interexaminer reliability was assessed from 30 pairs of replicate examinations of dentate persons conducted among the four examiners. Intraclass correlation coefficients were 1 .OO for missing teeth and 0.83 for retained roots, indicating a high level of interexaminer reliability. Analysis Edentulism rates were computed for all interviewed participants. Those who reported that they had no natural teeth were classified as edentulous. Differences in the prevalence of edentulism were examined for groups defined by sociodemographic factors ascertained during interviews: age group, sex, country of birth, living arrangements, the number of reported medical conditions, the receipt of home help (meals on-wheels, domestic services or nursing care), the possession of a pensioner health benefits card, reported financial hardship in paying a $100 dental fee, home ownership, duration of education, and categories of annual (pretax) household income. Statistical significance in rates of edentulism was evaluated using the chi-square test with continuity correction. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate multivariate effects of sociodemographic factors on the prevalence of edentulism. For the dentate people who had an oral examination, differences in the mean number of missing teeth were assessed among the sociodemographic groups, and evaluated using analysis of variance. Multivariate effects were evaluated using least squares regression. For the multivariate models, all sociodemographic variables were first included, then nonsignificant (P > 0.05) variables were eliminated. When only significant variables remained, tweway interactions were assessed between all first- order - terms. To examine associations between tooth loss and chewing capacity, those who reported that they could chew all six foods were compared with those who were unable to chew at least one of the six foods. In addition, the total number of foods causing difficulty was computed and the mean number of problem foods was compared among groups with different levels of tooth loss. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine whether any sociodemographic factors were associated with an inability to chew at least one food, after controlling for levels of tooth loss. We;,ghting In order to compute estimates that could be generalized to the Adelaide population of non institutionalized persons aged 60 years and over, data in this report (other than response rates) were weighted to account for the stratified sampling scheme. Weights for each of the 18 strata were computed using the stratum-specific population size (obtained from the electoral database) as numerator and stratum-specific sample size as denominator. That figure was further divided by the quotient of the complete population size divided by the complete sample size in order to avoid inflating the total number of cases used for the analysis. Sample size Sample size calculations made during the design of the study indicated that the sampling scheme should yield 1245 persons, which would be sufficient to detect hypothesised group differences in prevalence of 30 per cent and 40 per cent with a type I error of 5 per cent, a type I1 error of 20 per cent, and non- equivalent group sizes of up to 40 per cent. It was also anticipated that a proportion of sampled per- sons would not take part in the study, so information from the sampling frame was retained to examine participation rates by age and sex. In addition, the postcode of each sampled person was linked to census-derived socioeconomic indices describing aggregate income and education levels within postcodes.'' The linked data were used to examine potential bias due to nonparticipation. Ethical review This research project was reviewed and approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Human Experimentation at the University of Adelaide. Results Participation in the study: unweighted data Of the 2660 persons sampled from the state electoral database, 795 were out of scope because they no longer lived at the listed address or because they were in the subset of excluded edentulous persons. Of those in scope, 1160 people (62.2 per cent) took part in the interview. Of these, 683 were dentate, of whom 560 (82.0 per cent) had an oral examination. A further 313 edentulous people had an oral examination. The main reasons cited for non participation in the interview or examination were lack of interest or illness. There was significantly lower (P < 0.05) participation in the examination by people aged 80 years and over compared with younger people. Participation rates were also lower (P < 0.05) for people who lived at postcodes with a low index of economic resources compared with people who lived at postcodes with a higher index. For the 1865 people who were sampled and in scope, the effect of differences in participation rates on the unweighted prevalence of edentulism was assessed using a direct rate-adjustment procedure (Table 1). Among sampled people who were in scope, interview participation rates varied from 44.3 to 53.7 per cent among quartiles of economic resources (chi-square, 3 df, P< 0.01). The observed, unweighted edentulism rates among interviewed persons in those quartiles tended to be higher for the lower income quartiles. When the observed edentulism rate for each quartile was multiplied by the number of persons originally sampled from each quartile, it yielded an expected 717.7 edentulous people. That number represented 38.5 percent of the 1865 people who were sampled and in scope-a prevalence rate that differed only marginally from the observed (unweighted) rate of 38.4 per cent edentulous among interview participants. Characteristics of participants: weighted data Interviewed participants ranged in age between 60 and 99 years (median 72), 55.0 per cent were female, and 73.8 percent wore one or two dentures (57.0 per cent for dentate persons and 97.9 per cent for edentulous persons). other characteristics of interviewed participants are presented in Table 2 (percentage of interviewed persons) and indicate that the majority were Australian-born, living with others, and had experienced at least one of the questioned medical conditions. However, only one in ten people received home help. Nearly two-thirds of people had a pensioner health card, and there was a wide distribution of socioeconomic indicators (Table 2). Prevalence of edentulism and mean number of missing kth: weighted data The weighted estimate of edentulism was 41.1 per cent among all interviewed participants (Table 2), a figure that differs from the unweighted percentage of 38.5 per cent in Table 1. Table 2 shows higher rates of edentulism (P < 0.05) among people who were older, female and Australian-born. Higher rates were also observed among people who: lived alone, received home help, had more medical conditions, had a pensioner health benefits card, reported financial hardship paying a $100 dental fee, did not own their residence, left school at a younger age, and who had lower household income. For many subgroups, the prevalence of edentulism differed by a factor of two or more, and in the case of age groups there was a fourfold difference between people aged 60 to 64 years (15.3 percent edentulous) and people aged 80 and over (64.6 percent edentulous). The smallest differences in prevalence, of approximately 10 per cent, occurred among financial hardship subgroups. Among the 560 dentate people who had an oral examination, approximately half of all natural teeth were missing (mean = 15.2, median = 15, range = 0-31). Compared with the variations in edentulism, the mean number of missing teeth per dentate person showed less variation among socio demographic subgroups. However, there were more missing teeth (P < 0.05) among people who: were older, held a pensioner health benefits card, did not own their residence, left school at a younger age, and who had lower household income. In the case of age, there was a mean difference of 4.8 missing teeth per person between the youngest and oldest categories, while the absolute differences for other subgroups were less pronounced. Multivariable analysis: weighted data Logistic regression analysis revealed six factors independently associated with edentulism (Table 3). Age was used in the model as a continuous variable, and had an odds ratio of 1.09, representing a 9 per cent greater likelihood of edentulism for each additional year of age. For a difference of 10 years, this corresponds to an odds ratio of 2.34. There was also a greater likelihood of edentulism among persons who: were female, Australian-born, had a pensioner health benefits card, did not own their residence or who left school at a younger age. There were no statistically significant interactions among these variables. The least-squares regression analysis among den- tate people showed that age was also associated with the mean number of missing teeth, with an average of 0.17 additional missing teeth for each additional year of age (Table 4). Other factors independently associated with missing teeth were: Australian birth, having a pensioner health benefits card and leaving school at a younger age. Again, interactions were not statistically significant. Reported chewing capacity: weighted data Of the six foods queried during interviews, a whole fresh apple was the most difficult to chew, with one- third (32.7 per cent) of all people stating that they could not 'bite off and chew from' a whole apple. Boiled vegetables were the least difficult (0.8 percent of people). Some 37.9 percent of people reported difficulty with at least one of the six foods. Table 5 presents levels of reported chewing capacity for all examined people (both dentate and edentulous), grouped according to levels of tooth loss. The percentage of people reporting inability to chew at least one food item increased from 6.1 per cent among those with less than nine missing teeth, to 58.6 per cent among those who were edentulous. When groups were compared according to the mean number of foods that could not be chewed, there was a similar trend: an average of 0.1 1 foods among people with fewer than nine missing teeth to 1.08 foods for edentulous persons. Associations between tooth loss and both measures of chewing capacity were statistically significant (P < 0.01). Table 6 presents findings from the multivariate analysis of chewing capacity. The number of missing teeth, as a continuous variable, had a significant effect: the odds ratio for each additional missing tooth was 1.10, which corresponds with an odds ratio of 2.09 (95 percent confidence interval (CI) 1.82 to 2.41) for an additional eight missing teeth. The only other significant factor (P = 0.05) was age, also used as a continuous variable: for each year of age, the odds ratio for chewing dysfunction was 1.02, equivalent to an odds ratio of 1.25 (CI 1.00 to 1.56) for 10 additional years of age. Discussion In this study of non institutionalised Adelaide residents aged 60 years and over, tooth loss was common: 41.1 percent of people were edentulous, while among dentate persons nearly half of the natural teeth were missing (mean 15.2). Edentulism and missing teeth were more frequent among lower socioeconomic groups, including people with less educational attainment and pensioner health benefit card recipients: effects that persisted after controlling for age in the multivariate analyses (Tables 3 and 4). The higher rate of edentulism for females observed in previous Australian surveys was confirmed with this Adelaide sample, although the mean number of missing teeth among dentate persons was not significantly greater among females compared with males. Tooth loss was strongly associated with chewing capacity, with 58.6 percent of edentulous people reporting that they were unable to chew at least one of six common foods. Reduced chewing capacity was widespread, despite the observation that more than half of dentate people wore a denture, and virtually all edentulous people wore a denture. Chewing capacity was assessed in this study using a simple measure based on self-reported data. While the index itself has good properties of reliability and validity,I5 it refers only to capacity, rather than changes in dietary intake or any level of disability. Current concepts concerning ill-health make clear distinctions between capacity, disability and handicap, and these concepts are acknowledged as distinct outcomes in oral health.I8 For example, people may compensate for reduced chewing capacity by selecting dietary alternatives or by preparing foods in a different manner, and therefore they may experience no nutritional disadvantage or deterioration in their quality of life. However, chewing capacity represents a useful marker of basic oral function. Indeed, other findings from this study have revealed marked differences between dentate and edentulous persons in reported levels of discomfort, dys- function and disability due to dental condition^.'^ A factor that influences the interpretation of the current findings concerning tooth loss and chewing capacity is the observed variation in participation among age groups and socioeconomic groups. The analysis of nonresponse (Table 1) indicated a very small difference between the observed (unweighted) rate of edentulism and the expected rate after adjusting for differences in participation by socioeconomic groups. In addition, the weighting scheme used in other tables adjusts the data to be representative of the age and sex composition of the Adelaide population, and therefore corrects for age- associated differences in participation. Nonetheless, it is possible that participants differ from the Adelaide population on other key criteria, and it is likely that the weighted estimates of edentulism, missing teeth and chewing dysfunction represent small underestimates. Although edentulism was common, it was substantially less prevalent than the figure from 1975, when 75.5 of Adelaide residents aged 65 and over were edentulous. * The prevalence for the same age group in this study (46.8 per cent) was also lower than the figure of 57 per cent reported for Adelaide persons aged 65 and over in the National Oral Health Survey.1 These striking temporal declines in edentulism suggest that cohort effects are predominant; as more recently born generations enter the 65-and- over age group in the later decades of this century, they appear to have a low probability of edentulism. There are suggestions of this effect within the current sample: only 15.3 percent of people aged 60 to 64 years were edentulous, and it seems unlikely that they will experience a sufficiently high level of additional tooth loss during the next five years to enter the 65-49 age group with the prevalence of 33.1 percent observed here. Similarly, these rates of edentulism are more than 20 per cent lower than those found in the mid-1980s in representative surveys conducted in Melbourne and Brisbane.’ Comparisons with those Australian studies that have included oral examinations reveal less dramatic temporal reductions in the mean number of missing teeth among dentate people. Compared with the mean of 151.9 missing teeth for Adelaide residents aged 65 and over reported here, the mean for South Australia (age 65 + ) in 1987 was 16.4.’ In Brisbane (age 65+) im 1984, the mean number of missing teeth was 16.6,’ while in Melbourne (age 55+ ) in 1985 a mean of 14.2 was reported.R In the 1991 study of Melbourine people in collective living centres, the mean number of missing teeth varied from 16.0 (60-69 years) to 20.2 (80+ years): values that exceeded the age-specific rates observed here by approximately two teeth per person. Associations between edentulism and sex, country of birth and socioeconomic status (based on occupation) were also observed among South Australians by Roder in 1975, although multivariate analyses were not reported for that statewide ~survey.~ The current finding of a similar association in the 1990s reveals that sociodemographic inequalities in oral health status have persisted in South Australia. Furthermore, the current findings indicate that markers of socioeconomic status from early in life (for example, education) as well as those concerned with existing economic circumstances (for example, pensioner health benefit card entitlement) have independent associations with edentulism. The findings concerning country of birth revealed higher levels of both edentulism and tooth loss among Australian-born persons (Table 2), and this provided the basis for dichotomising country of birth in the subsequent multivariate analysis (Tables 3 and 4). Nonetheless, people born in the United Kingdom had a rate of edentulism that was only marginally less than Australian-born persons, while den- tate people born in ‘other’ places had only a marginally lower mean number of missing teeth than Australian-born persons (Table 2). When country of birth was dichotomised to compare people born in Australia, the United Kingdom and Eire with people born in ‘other’ countries, and the multivariate models were reanalysed, the logistic regres- TOOTH LOSS AND CHEWING CAPACITY sion model remained virtually unchanged (Table 3), while country of birth ceased to be statistically significant in the least squares regression model (Table 4). Hence, the consistent finding was that Australian-born people had the highest level of tooth loss. From a public health perspective, these findings reveal substantially compromised oral health among older adults in Adelaide. While these findings confirm rapid rates of decline in edentulism, it is clear that the oldest old (aged 80+) and economically disadvantaged groups experience the greatest burden of tooth loss. In addition, older persons were more likely to have reduced chewing capacity, even after controlling for the number of missing teeth (Table 6). Since chewing capacity was limited despite the frequent use of dentures, these findings should support efforts at prevention of tooth loss among older adults through control of dental caries and periodontal diseases: the two factors most likely to lead to tooth loss among older adults. Additional research from longitudinal oral epidemiological studies should permit more precise identification of the risk factors for tooth loss which could be used to develop strategies for prevention. A recent review of oral health care for older adults in Australia has recommended four general strategies for improving oral health: health promotion, both for individuals and their caregivers; improved availability of dental services, especially for disadvantaged and rural dwelling persons; improved monitoring and evaluation of oral health goals; and additional dental education and research.2 Oral health promotion activities may include denture hygiene and plaque control for natural teeth as well as the appropriate use of fluorides for canes prevention. The availability of dental services for low- income older adults has recently been a focus of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. However, issues of general health status, transportation and physical access to clinics may still be acting as barriers to dental care. Improved monitoring and evaluation of oral health goals among older adults could be achieved through a periodic national dental survey. It's Just less than 10 years since the first national dental survey in Australia and the repeating of such a survey at an appropriate interval would provide the necessary information for monitoring and evaluation of oral health goals. The fourth strategy calls for improved education and research. The increased population of older adults with compromised oral health presents a challenge to dental clinicians. Dental clinicians must be well prepared through their education (continuously updated through the dissemination of research) to provide best practice dental care for older adults.

Does denture-wearing status in edentulous South Korean Elderly persons affect their nutritional intakes?,Sun Young Han and Cheoul Sin Kim,"Objective:The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether denture-wearing status in edentulous South Korean elderly affected their nutritional intakes, using the 2008–2010 data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES).Background:Good nutritional status is a requirement for healthy aging in the elders. Tooth loss is the key to lead to low masticatory ability and alternative food choice, which may increase the risks of systemic disease. Therefore, denture treatment is important to improve general health of edentulous persons.Materials and methods:From KNHANES data, 1168 edentulous older people were selected as the participants of the present study. Nutrient intake data collected via participants’ 24-h dietary recalls were used to determine the ratio of nutrient intake to the Recommended Dietary Allowance for Koreans, the percentage of individuals with inadequate nutrient and the effects of denture wearing on the risk of undernourishment.Results:The results showed that compared to denture wearers, edentulous persons without dentures had lower intakes of potassium, niacin and vitamin C. In addition, the distribution of inadequate nutrient intake among participants without dentures was higher than among participants with dentures; the risk of undernourishment was 1.89 times that of denture wearers. [Correction made on 21 March 2014, after first online publication: “[...] participants with dentures was higher than among participants without dentures”was corrected to “[...] participants without dentures was higher than among participants with dentures”]Conclusion:Denture wearing was seen to have a significant effect on the level of nutrient intake in edentulous elderly.Keywords:dentures, edentulism, nutrition.","Introduction The average lifespan of South Korea has greatly increased because of medical advances and improvements in living environments. In 2000,South Korea has already become an aging society and is expected to become a super-aged society in 2026. Among the life stage groups, the elders are especially vulnerable to health issues related to reduce nutrient intake. This is due to various age-related changes that affect nutrient intake such as physical and social changes, chronic disease,decreased mobility, medication use, swallowing difficulty and depression 1,2. Furthermore, the most representative change in the oral cavity is tooth loss.Tooth loss decreases masticatory ability and causes changes in food selection, contributing to increased risk of systemic disease 4. In a previous study, Korean edentulous persons had lower intake levels of iron, potassium, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin C compared to the group of individuals with one tooth or more 5. These Nutrients are usually gained by consuming vegetables, fruits and meat, but edentulous individuals have limitations in food selection they can consume 6. In particular, inadequate fruit and vegetable intake is one of the five major risk factors that affect the global burden of disease 7. Therefore, itcan raise the incidence of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disease, especially digestive cancers 8. Denture treatment is one of the methods for oral rehabilitation in edentulous persons and can improve nutrient intake 9. It has been known that denture wearers are at increased health risk compared to individuals with natural teeth because they have certain limitations in food intake 10,11;however, it is obvious that edentulous individuals without dentures are at even higher risk. According to a previous study, the percentage of edentulous individuals without dentures that reported inability to masticate food owing to oral issues was higher (70%) than that of edentulous denture wearers (35%) and individuals with natural teeth (18%)12. Also, wearing dentures contributed to a high Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA)score13.Food selection is influenced by political, environmental, social and individual factors 14. Therefore, researchers need to consider subject’country and cultures. Several studies have been conducted on the relationship between tooth loss or denture-wearing status and food or nutrient intakes in Eastern countries 15–17. However, there have been no prior reports of nutrient intakes in the South Korean edentulous older people according to denture-wearing status. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether denture-wearing status in edentulous South Korean elderly affected their nutritional intakes.The hypothesis of the study was that the denture-wearing status in edentulous elders would influence on their nutritional intakes.Materials and methods Data source and subject selection The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) is a nationwide health and nutrition survey, with the aim of reaching a holistic understanding of the health and food intake statuses of South Korea; since 2007, this survey has been conducted on a yearly basis.Complex, stratified multistage probability sampling designs and weighting adjustments were performed to represent the entire South Korea Population. The survey is divided into four domains: the Health Interview Survey, Health Behaviour Survey, Health Examination Survey And Nutrition Survey.The 2008–2010 datasets of KNHANES were combined and analysed. In total, 4258 older people aged over 65 years completed both the Health Examination Survey and the Nutrition Survey. Of These, 1168 individuals who were edentulous in one or both arches were selected as participants for the final analysis. Oral examination was conducted by trained dentists. In the Nutrition Survey, an individual’s daily intake was gathered through 24-h dietary recalls.Definition of study participants The number of present teeth in the upper and lower arch was calculated separately, and individuals that were either edentulous in only one anchor both arches were defined as the participants of this study. The participants divided into denture wearers and non-wearers.Dietary reference intakes Dietary reference intakes (DRIs) are determined by each country, based on the dietary habits of its citizens. South Korea’s DRIs consist of Estimated Average Requirements (EARs), Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI), Adequate Intake (AI) and Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL). The reference intakes for carbohydrates and lipids are denoted by the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDRs). The EARs is the daily requirement accounting for 50% of healthy individuals and serves as the minimum reference level for evaluating inadequate nutrient intake. In the case of energy, however, the term Estimated Energy Requirement (EER) is used, as it is difficult to measure individual energy requirements exactly.RNI is the intake level that is estimated to fulfil nutrient requirements in 97–98% of a healthy population, categorised by gender and age group.AI is given when there is insufficient data on nutrient requirements, or when it is difficult to determine the median value and standard deviation for nutrient requirements. UL is the maximum dietary reference intake that does not have harmful effects on the body. Each nutrient has at least one of these reference intakes.Assessment of nutrient intakes In this study, we used three types of nutritional intake variables: nutrition intake ratio, the percent of participants with inadequate nutrient intake and undernourishment.Nutrition intake ratio was calculated as the proportion of an amount of energy or nutrient intaketo the DRIs for Korean. EER was used for energy;RNI was used for protein, calcium, phosphorus,iron, vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin C; and AI data were used for sodium and potassium. Energy intake ratios for protein, lipids and carbohydrates were obtained based on the AMDRs.Each percent of participants with inadequate nutrient intake by energy or nutrients was calculated as the proportion of persons who intakes energy<75% of the EER or nutrients below theEARs5. EARs was used as the reference intake, so that nutrients without EARs data were excluded from this analysis.The undernourished person was carried out if the person intakes energy<75% of the EER combined with calcium, iron, vitamin A and riboflavin intake below the respective EARs by previous study 18. Then, the undernourishment was coded 1 and the others were coded 0 for logistic regression analysis.Socio Economic factors Variables selected in addition to age and gender were income level, education level and receipt of welfare. Income level was categorised into four tiers according to monthly average household income by gender and age range. Education level was categorised based on highest completed education. Current welfare recipient status was also a category.Statistical analysis Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was based on a complex sample design. We presented the estimated values andused the following analysis methods: generalisedlinear analysis, Chi-square test and logistic regres-sion analysis by controlling for age, gender, socio-economic variables using PASW Statistic 18.0(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).ResultsTable 1 shows the distribution of denture wearstatus according to common characteristics. Themean age of participants was 75.116.14 years.A total of 61.7% of participants were in low-income status, 82.4% were in the least educa-tional level and 92.4% were non-welfare recipi-ents. Among 1168 participants, 87.8% weredenture wearers.Table 2 shows the nutrient intake ratios andmacronutrient intake ratios according to denturewearing. The nutrient intakes of the edentulouselders fell short of DRIs for all nutrients with theexception of phosphorus, iron and sodium.Compared to denture wearers, non-wearers had asignificantly lower-intake rate of phosphorus,iron, potassium, niacin and vitamin C. Especially,according to the edentulous status, the differencesbetween denture wearers and non-wearers werefound to be that vitamin A intake in participantswore denture in only one arch (p=0.019) andthiamine intake in participants wore denture inboth arches (p=0.018). Macronutrient intakeratios to AMDRs showed that regardless of den-ture wearing, edentulous elders had low lipidintake and excessive carbohydrate intake.The percentage of participants with inadequatenutrient intake for overall nutrients, which wascarried out as proportion of persons who intakeless nutrients than the DRIs, was significantly dif-ferent in denture wearers (12.8%) and non-wear-ers (20.3%) (p=0.047) (data not shown). Theper cent of participants with inadequate nutrientintake for each nutrient was significantly higherin non-wearers in iron and thiamine. In the case of participants with only one edentulous arch,there was a significant difference in energy, pro-tein, iron and vitamin A; in completely edentulous participants, there was a significant difference for iron only (Table 3).A logistic regression analysis performed to investigate the effect of denture wearing on the risk of undernourishment. Even after adjusting for socioeconomic variables, non-wearers were at1.89 times higher risk compared to denture wearers (p=0.045). Additionally, risk increased 1.05-fold as age increased (p=0.049).Discussion Compared to denture wearers, non-wearers had significantly lower nutrient intake for phosphorus,iron, potassium, niacin and vitamin C (Table 2).However, it has been reported that Korean adults have higher phosphorus and iron intake than the DRIs for these nutrients. Thus, the nutrients for which denture wearing may cause a significant difference are potassium, niacin and vitamin C.The main sources of potassium in South Korea Are vegetables, kimchi and fruits; the main niacin sources are white rice, pork and beef; and vitamin C mainly comes from fruits (especially citrus unshiu and kimchi)18. Thus, non-wearers who have difficulty masticating usually prefer soft-processed foods, and consume less of foods that are hard and difficult to chew, as well as vegetables, fruits and meats; these characteristics were mostly reported by individuals with difficulty masticating 19,20. The vulnerability of non-wearers was also seen in the percentage of participants with inadequate nutrient intake for overall nutrients.The percentage of participants with inadequate nutrient intake for overall nutrients was 20.3% inn on-wearers, which was significantly higher thanthe 12.8% of denture wearers. Given that the average rate of inadequate nutrient intake in South Korea’s elderly population is 14.3%, the impact of denture-wearing status on inadequate nutrient intake could be seen (data not shown). Logistic regression analysis also showed that non-wearers had a 1.89-fold higher risk for under-nourishment compared with denture wearers.In a previous study, older people in South Korea had very low intake levels compared to the DRIs for all nutrients with the exception of phosphorus, iron and sodium; in particular, calcium,potassium and riboflavin intakes were only about 49–50% of their DIRs21. The present study also showed that the calcium and riboflavin intakeswere 49–54% of the DRIs for these nutrients.Therefore, this observation can be interpreted as a result of the general characteristics of the Korean Elders rather than the state of being edentulous(Table 2). Calcium is a nutrient deficient in Koreans, and intake levels have not reached 100%since 1980; riboflavin is also a nutrient with low intake in Koreans, although a gradual increase in intake has been observed 21. Calcium acts to lower blood pressure and it is considered a particularly important nutrient for Koreans who are at high risk for hypertension due to high sodium intake.In addition, the percentage of participants with inadequate nutrient intake exceeded 30% at all nutrients, with the exception of phosphorus,which caused concern for an overall intake inadequacy, irrespective of denture wearing (Table 3).This percentage was very similar to that of the general older people in South Korea 18. However,there was a significant difference in the percentages of participants with low iron (p=0.004) and thiamine intake (p=0.035). In particular, it was seen that the percentage of participants with low iron intake was 30% in the average elders and 33% in denture wearers, but was close to 50% in non-wearers. This study also showed differences in nutrient intakes of individuals with one or both edentulous arches, according to denture-wearing status. We expect that this data can be referenced in the future in order for dental clinicians to provide more detailed nutrient counselling to edentulous individuals.Changes of diet arising from oral status changes are directly linked to undernutrition. Individuals With fewer natural teeth consume less of the foods rich in nutrients such as vegetables, fruits,meats and grains 10,22. Also, those who have difficulty masticating also prefer soft, easily chewable foods, and generally have meals that are lower in nutritional quality 10. Furthermore, edentulous person without dentures or with only one denture frequently consumed mashed foods, and theMNA scores of these individuals were reported to be lower than those of individuals consuming regular meals 13.The major sources of potassium, niacin and vitamin C are fruits, vegetables, dietary fibre andmeats. Systemic diseases associated with these sources include the following: a decrease in dietary fibre is associated with cardiovascular disease;deficiencies in the consumption of fruits, vegetables and vitamin C are associated with stomach cancer; and levels of vitamin C are related to the risk of cataracts 23,24. Inadequate consumption of red meat affects diet-related chronic non-communicable diseases25.In a logistic regression analysis, variables, such as gender, age, income, education and receipt of welfare, were adjusted to determine the risk of undernourishment with respect to denture wearing only (Table 4). Receipt of welfare was recently reported that a higher percentage of elderly welfare recipients requires dentures; thus, this has an impact on the oral health of Korean elders 26. Prior studies similar to the present study have been conducted in several countries. A Brazilian Study reported that dentures were beneficial to the nutritional status, because edentulous individuals without dentures were at higher risk of becoming malnourished, but those with complete dentures had good nutritional status 1. Another Study has reported that denture treatment resulted in increased body weight and serum albumin level by improving their nutrition in Japanese elders 27.Types and amount of food and recipe are different between countries even though the mineral/vitamin intake would be similar. Therefore,research needs to take account of the country and culture 15. For example, Taiwanese elders tend to overconsume niacin and vitamin C unlike Korean elders need to increase their intakes in this study 28. In comparison with Taiwanese carbohydrate intakes, Korean elders tended to consume cereals, snacks and bread instead of meat.Since this study is an analysis of previously completed national survey data, there are some limitations. First, the Nutrition Survey is limited in that it collected only a single day’s worth of data by 24-h dietary recalls, and that it cannot reflect the entirety of an individual’s regular intakes. Second, the Nutrition Survey was conducted without considering the variable of seasonal changes. The consumption of fruits such as tangerines, apples and persimmons is affected by the seasons 21.However, despite these limitations, this study is meaningful because it was to investigate the nutritional intakes of edentulous individuals according to denture-wearing status based on a large representative sample of older South Koreans. Proper dietary habits are a prerequisite to health, and good dietary habits are a requirement for healthy aging. As this study revealed that dentures, independent of socioeconomic factors, are a risk factor for undernutrition in elderly, these results should be considered when planning nationwide supportive services. Since July 2012,complete dentures were covered by health insurance in South Korea. An improvement in the nutrient intakes of vulnerable groups can be expected with such nutritional support. In several years, a future study should be performed to measure the extent of these improvements in mitigating nutrient intake inequalities.Conclusions Among South Korean edentulous elderly above the age of 65 years, those without dentures were more vulnerable to certain deficiencies in nutrients intake, had a greater proportion of participants with intake lower than the DRIs and had a 1.89-fold higher risk of having inadequate nutrient intake compared to participants with dentures.Therefore, denture-wearing status had a significant effect on the nutritional intakes of South Korean elders.",-,"1.

Nutritional status was measured bynutrient intake, Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score, serumvalues, and body mass index (BMI).Subjects/settingData from 5,958 participants in NHANESIII ages 50 years and over with dental examination were in-cluded in the analysis.Statistical analyses performedAnalysis of covariance andmultivariate linear regression analyses were performed toexamine associations between number of tooth pairs and nu-tritional status indicators controlled for potential confound-ers.ResultsCompared with individuals with five to eight poste-rior occluding pairs (HEI68.2), those with impaired denti-tion (no posterior pairs, one to four pairs remaining, or fulldentures) had consistently lower HEI scores (HEI64.3,66.5, and 66.5, respectively), consumed fewer servings offruits, and had lower serum values of beta carotene andascorbic acid. Participants with one to four posterior pairsalso had a higher mean BMI (28.0) than those with five ormore pairs (27.2). Participants in one or more groups withimpaired dentition had lower dietary intake levels of vitaminA, carotene, folic acid, and vitamin C, and scored less well ondiet variety, cholesterol, and sodium components of the HEI.Applications/conclusionsResults show that dental healthis closely associated with nutritional status and suggest thatstatus of dentition should be considered in nutritional coun-seling and assessment of older adults.","Loss of teeth results in impaired chewing ability (1,2) and avoidance of foods that are difficult to chew (3-5). These Consequences may ultimately lead to clinically important outcomes such as poor diet quality and poor nutritional status because difficult-to-chew foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are nutrient-dense. Previous studies suggest that individuals who are edentate in one or both archesand use full dentures tend to be most severely affected in terms of poor nutritional intake. Intakes of fruits and vegetables, beta carotene, and nonstarch polysaccharides (fiber) are consistently lower among edentate than dentate persons (6-9). Among individuals with some teeth, there is a linear trend of decreasing nutrient intake as the total number of teeth decreases (8).Few studies of free-living elderly people have examined nutritional status indicators other than dietary intake. A complete nutritional assessment requires information on blood or urine biochemistries, anthropometric measures, and clinical observations.Sheiham and colleagues (10) observed that edentate individuals and those with few natural teeth remaining had lower plasma levels of vitamin C in addition to consuming lower amounts of protein, fiber, calcium, vitamin C, and a number of other vitamins.The function and position of the remaining teeth seems to be a more accurate indicator of chewing ability than merely the total number of teeth present (4). The primary function of the posterior teeth is to grind food. These posterior grinding teeth consist of two molars and two premolars in each arch for a total of 16 teeth or eight pairs. These teeth are also known as posterior occluding pairs of teeth. The number of posterior occluding pairs of teeth would be expected to correlate with intakes of selected foods and nutrients as well, but few studies have focused on this measure of dental status. Shinkai and colleagues(11) reported that the number of posterior units was not re-lated to intake of most nutrients or to diet quality as measuredby the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) (12).The purpose of this study was to examine dietary quality andintake of specific nutrients in relation to dentition status in thethird National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES III) population over age 50, and extend previousfindings by including information on body mass index (BMI)and selected serum nutrient levels in the participants.METHODSData from NHANES III, conducted between 1988 and 1994,were used for this study. NHANES III was designed to assessthe health and nutrition of a large representative sample of thenoninstitutionalized civilian United States population. The sur-vey had a stratified multistage probability design to select arepresentative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized pop-ulation. Data were collected via household interviews and fromphysical examinations conducted in specially equipped mobileexamination centers (MEC). Information collected includeddemographic, dental, medical, nutritional, biochemical, and an-thropometric measurements. During the interview, informa-tion on medication and dietary supplement use was also ob-tained. Details of the study are provided elsewhere (13).Independent Variables and CovariatesIn our study, we describe dental status as the number ofposterior occlusal pairs of teeth (molars and premolars,maximumeight pairs), number of posterior teeth present,and total number of teeth. Except for full dentures, natural andprosthetic teeth were counted as present. Oral health exami-nation consisted of visual and tactile oral and dental examina-tion performed by a licensed dentist and administered in theMEC. In addition to the comprehensive dental examination, aprosthesis assessment and denture questionnaire was admin-istered. Details of the protocol can be found elsewhere (14).Total number and pairs of posterior teeth, as continuous and discrete variables, were examined in association with nutritional status indicators. Those participants who wore full dentures were treated as having no teeth when the variable was examined as continuous. This assumption was made because the chewing ability of these individuals is known to be similar to that of individuals with very few teeth. This would tend to err on the conservative side. To examine the data in more detail,discrete variables were created for total teeth and for posterior teeth. The discrete variable for total teeth included assigning the data of people into three categories; full dentures, fewer than 18 teeth, and 18 or more teeth. The discrete variable for pairs of posterior teeth included four categories: people with zero teeth,one to four pairs of posterior teeth,five or more pairs of posterior teeth, and full denture wearers.Outcome Variables The nutritional status outcomes used in our study were dietary,biochemical, and anthropometric measures. Dietary outcomes included absolute nutrient intake of vitamins C, E, A, folate,and carotenes, the HEI score, and its individual components.Dietary intake data were collected via a 24-hour recall and analyzed for nutrient content (13). The dietary intake data were recorded to provide an HEI score, a measure of overall quality of an individual’s diet. The HEI is composed of 10 components, each representing different aspects of a healthful diet as defined by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 1995(15) and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food Guide Pyramid (16). Each HEI component is scored according to the consumed number of servings of each of the five food groups (grain, fruit, vegetable, meat, and dairy), the percentage of calories from fat and saturated fat, the consumed amount of cholesterol and sodium, and a measure of dietary variety. The total score has a maximum of 100 and is the sum ofthese 10 dietary components, weighted equally (12,17). It isimportant to note that a high score is given for an assignedminimum intake of thefive food groups and the dietary varietycomponent. However, a high score is given for low intakes ofthe fat, cholesterol, and sodium components. The HEI providesa picture of foods people are eating, the amount of variety in thediet, and compliance with specific dietary guidelines recom-mendations. The HEI scores were then classified as a good diet(score greater than 80), a needs improvement diet (score be-tween 51 and 80), and a poor diet (score less than 51).A comprehensive biochemical and nutrient profile was mea-sured on serum, blood, and urine (13). In this study, serumvitamins C, E, folate, and beta carotene were selected as nutri-tional status indicators. The laboratory methods for measuringthese nutrients are described elsewhere (13). Finally, the BMI,calculated as measured weight in kilograms divided by theheight in meters squared, was used as the anthropometric out-come measure.SubjectsOf all subjects ages 50 years and over examined in the survey(n8,654), 5,958 had data available for the current analysis.Excluded were 1,719 subjects who did not have a dental exam-ination; 1 subject with no dietary, biochemical, or BMI data; 250subjects whofit in the“other”racial/ethnic category; 7 who didnot have data on self-reported health condition; and 719 whodid not have information on their poverty status. Of the 5,958participants whose data were used in the analysis, 20 did nothave body weight and height measures, 222 did not have di-etary intake data, and 476 participants had missing serum data.Statistical AnalysisThe analyses were conducted using the SUDAAN softwarepackage (Release 5.50, 1991, Research Triangle Institute, Re-search Triangle Park, NC) to adjust for complex study design.We used descriptive statistics to obtain weighted mean andfrequency distributions for sociodemographic and health sta-tus variables andttests and2to examine differences in se-lected characteristics among study participants and those ofpeople excluded from the study for missing data. Linear regres-sion analysis modeling was performed to examine associationsbetween the dental variables used as discreet and continuousand the nutritional status indicator outcomes, adjusting forconfounding variables. Least square adjusted means of HEIscore, nutrients, and BMI were obtained within categories ofdental status, and tests for trend were performed byfitting thevariables in their continuous form in the regression models.The potentially confounding variables, age, sex, race/ethnic-ity, poverty income ratio (PIR), education, smoking status, andself-reported health condition, were controlled for in the re-gression models. Vitamin/mineral use was also included as apotential confounder in the association between dental healthand serum nutrient levels. Total calorie intake was entered inthe model when the outcome variable was nutrient intake orBMI. Race/ethnicity was self-reported, and NHANES III was designed to provide reliable estimates for three race/ethnicgroups: non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexi-can Americans. All“other”race/ethnicities were excluded fromthis study. Attained levels of education were grouped intothree categories: less than high school education, high schooleducation, and some college/graduate school. Smoking was de-fined as current, former, and never. PIR was also included inthe model to control for socioeconomic status. The PIR was computed by NHANES III as a ratio of two components. The Enumerator was the midpoint of the observed family income category in the Family Questionnaire, and the denominator was the poverty threshold, the age of the family reference person, and the calendar year in which the family was interviewed(13). Poverty threshold values are based on calendar years and adjusted for changes caused by inflation between calendar years. Vitamin/mineral use in the past month was recorded as yes/no answer. The survey participants were asked if their health, in general, was excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.This variable was treated as discrete, with good health encompassing the first three responses, and poor encompassing the last two responses.RESULTS Selected weighted characteristics of study participants are presented in Table 1, separately for men and women. The study population is composed of 49% men and 51% women, with an average age of 64.1 and 65.4 years for men and women, respectively. As compared with women, more men were current or former smokers (75% men vs 45.5% women) and had a college education, although a smaller percentage of men than women completed high school. Self-reported health condition wasabout the same by gender, with 75% of participants reporting good health. Women had on average a higher mean score than men for total HEI and its components: fruit, fat, sodium, and cholesterol. Women consumed lower levels of the absolute vitamins;however, these were not adjusted for calorie intake in Table 1. The Serum concentration of vitamins tended to be higher for women than for men, and more women used vitamin/mineral supplements. Mean BMI values appeared similar for both genders.The Healthy Eating Index Table 2 shows the adjusted least square means of the HEI score and its individual components by the categories for posterior pairs of teeth. Wearing dentures or having fewer than five pairs of posterior teeth was significantly and inversely associated with the HEI score even after adjusting for the confounders of age, gender, ethnicity, smoking, education, self-reported health condition, and calorie intake. These results seem to be primarily attributable to significantly lower fruit intake by participants with fewer posterior pairs of teeth and to a lesser extent to the lower score for the cholesterol and variety components. These results were consistently observed when the other categorical and continuous dental variables were used, inturn, in the regression model. In addition, the HEI score for the components vegetable and variety were significantly lower among participants with no posterior pairs of teeth as compared with the referent group (five or more pairs). Although Not statistically significant, there seems to be a trend toward lower scores for fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol among participants with fewer pairs of posterior teeth. This lower score implies a higher intake of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.When the HEI score was examined by its three criteria, good,needs improvement, and poor, by pairs of posterior teeth, the percentage of participants consuming diets in the poor category was 26.3% (zero posterior pairs of teeth) vs 8.8% (five to eight pairs of teeth) and the percentage of participants consuming diets in the good category was 9.7% vs 24.2%. The Percent of participants with dentures or one to four pairs of teeth and who had HEI scores in the good and poor category fit in between (13.3% and 15.4% good and 12.9% and 14.3% poor,respectively).Nutrient Intakes Mean dietary intakes of carotenoids, folacin, and ascorbic acid of participants with one to four pairs of posterior teeth were significantly lower than the intakes of those with five to eight pairs of teeth or of those with dentures (Table 3). Edentulous participants had lower intakes of these dietary nutrients, although the results did not reach statistical significance. Also, vitamin A Intake of edentulous participants and of denture wearers was significantly lower than among the referent population. No significant differences were seen in vitamin E intakes among the groups.Fiber intake was highest among participants with five or more pairs of posterior teeth (17.4 g) and lowest among those with no pairs of teeth (12.7 g). The average intake of fiber among participants with one to four pairs of posterior teeth orthose wearing dentures was in between (15.4 g and 15.0 g,respectively). However, when the regression analysis was adjusted for potential confounders, only the group with no pairs of posterior teeth had a significantly lower intake of fiber as compared with participants with five or more pairs of posterior teeth.Serum Levels Serum vitamin C and beta carotene levels were significantly and positively associated with number of pairs of posterior teeth (Table 4). These associations were consistently found for beta carotene when the other dental variables were used in the model. Serum vitamin C level was also significantly lower among participants with fewer than 18 teeth compared with those with more than 18 teeth, but not when the dental variables were examined as continuous. No associations were found with vitamin E, but serum folate level was lower among denture wearers than among the referent group.Anthropometric Measures Table 5 shows that there was a significantly higher BMI among individuals with fewer number of posterior teeth . This was also seen among participants with one to four pairs of posterior teeth as compared with the referent group (five or more pairs of teeth), although not among edentulous individuals or denture wearers. Edentulous individuals had significantly lower calorie intakes as compared with the individuals in the otherdental categories (data not shown).DISCUSSION In this study, we found a positive association between number of teeth, particularly pairs of occlusal posterior teeth, and the nutritional status of individuals as determined by dietary quality and serum levels of nutrients, and an inverse association between individuals with one to four posterior pairs of teeth and BMI. In Addition to a lower overall HEI score and a higher risk of scoring in the poor range, persons with no posterior tooth pairs consumed less fruit and vegetables and had less variety in their diets. The Associations were independent of age, gender, ethnicity, education, poverty index, and smoking status. These variations in food intake patterns by dental status were reflected both in lower intakes of specific nutrients (vitamin A, carotene, vitamin C, folate,and fiber) as well as in lower blood levels of carotene and vitamin C, and in folate in subjects with full dentures.In a subset of participants in the Oral Health: San Antonio Longitudinal Study of Aging, dentition status was defined on the basis of presence of posterior functional units and removable dentures by Shinkai and colleagues (11). The investigators found a similar trend in HEI among dentition groups, with people with good dentition having the highest HEI scores. How-ever, the differences were not statistically significant. Only the variety component of the HEI and a few individual nutrients(energy,fiber, and vitamin C) were weakly correlated with the number of posterior functional tooth units (10). Rather, other factors such as sex, ethnicity, and age predicted dietary quality. This may be attributable to their smaller sample size, the younger age of their study sample, and the different definitions of the dentition groups.There are limited data on the impact of missing teeth on biochemical and anthropometric measures of nutritional assessment.Among noninstitutionalized elderly persons in Britain, plasma levels of vitamin C were approximately 20% higher among those with five or more posterior occluding pairs of teeth compared with those with no pairs. In addition, edentate individuals had lower plasma levels of retinal (10). Others have also reported an effect of dental status on blood levels of vitamins A and C (18). Previous studies of the association between dentition status and body weight have yielded mixed results. Among independent elders, those with dentures or no teeth tend to have a higher BMI (19). The association tends to be reversed in institutionalized populations, where low BMI and other signs of malnutrition are more common among edentate residents (20).In our study of noninstitutionalized individuals, an elevated BMI may indicate an adaptation to decreased chewing ability by eating foods high in caloric density.The results of the present study indicate that the number of posterior pairs of teeth is more strongly associated with nutritional status than the total number of teeth or the number of posterior teeth. The continuous variables did not always support the findings observed using the categorical variables. This May be attributable to a number of reasons. The association between wearing dentures and dietary intake may be confounded by factors related to fit of dentures and frequency of use. Wearing dentures may not consistently be associated with poorer intake and may depend on the type of food selected within food groups. In our analysis, we treated denture wearers as edentulous, which would lead to misclassification and at best weaken the results and potentially eliminate associations.Therefore, we conducted sensitivity analysis by excluding the data of denture wearers. The results showed stronger associations, and the variety component of the HEI and serum vitamin C associations became significant. This indicates that the data of denture wearers need to be examined separately and supports the use of categorical variables in the analysis. In addition, functional placement of remaining teeth, particularly the number of posterior tooth pairs, has been suggested as an important factor in explaining patient satisfaction and oral quality of life (21,22), chewing ability (21,23), and nutritional status(10). Perceived chewing ability and avoidance of dry solid foods such as bread were related to the number of molar tooth pairs, but not anterior teeth, in a study of elderly men and women (4). Sheiham and colleagues (10) evaluated nutrient intakes according to total number of teeth and number of posterior occluding pairs. The results were nearly identical regardless of which index of dental status was used. Fewer pairs of posterior teeth were significantly related to lower intakes of energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate,fiber, calcium, and vitamin C.The strength of this study is that the data are derived from national survey with a representative sample of the US adult population. The nutritional status measures include dietary intake but also patterns of food intake, serum levels, and anthropometric measures. Several potential confounders were collected in the survey and could, therefore, be controlled for. Inaddition, the data excluded from our study tended to be ofindividuals in poorer health and lower socioeconomic status asindicated by attained level of education and poverty indicator.This would limit the effect of potential confounders.APPLICATIONSThe results of this study indicate the importance of dentalhealth to the nutritional status of individuals and, ultimately, totheir overall health. This is particularly appropriate because inNHANES III, the adult, noninstitutionalized population with noteeth remaining ranged from 12% among those 50 to 54 yearsold up to a high of 44% in those over 75 years of age. Overall,10.5% of NHANES III adult subjects ages 18 years and overwere edentate. In addition, among dentate individuals over age65, more than half had at least one missing premolar or molartooth (24).Replacement of missing posterior teeth is not a universally ac-cepted practice. The cost of prosthetics may be an important issuefor elders, many of whom do not have dental insurance or do notmake regular visits to the dentist (25). This suggests that preven-tion of tooth loss is important. It also indicates that dental healthshould be obtained as an integral component of nutrition assess-ment and be acknowledged as part of nutrition counseling.",-,"1.Idowu AT, Graser GN, Handelman SL.

Tooth Loss Is Associated With an Increased Risk of Hypertension in Postmenopausal Women,"Akira Taguchi, Mitsuhiro Sanada, Yoshikazu Suei, Masahiko Otsuka, Kaoru Lee, Keiji Tanimoto, Mikiyo Tsuda, Koso Ohama, Masao Yoshizumi, Yukihito Higashi","Tooth loss has been associated with an increased risk of vascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. Little is known whether hypertension is an important factor linking 2 phenomena in postmenopausal women. We compared an incidence of hypertension and traditional risk factors for vascular diseases between 2 age-matched groups: 67 postmenopausal women with missing teeth and 31 without missing teeth. In addition to blood pressure, serum concentration of total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, plasma angiotensin II concentration, plasma renin activity, and resting heart rate were measured as traditional risk factors for vascular diseases. Subjects without missing teeth had significantly lower diastolic blood pressure than did subjects with missing teeth (P=0.021). The former tended to have lower systolic blood pressure than did the latter (P=0.058). There were no significant differences in other variables between subjects with and without missing teeth. The odds ratio of having hypertension in subjects with missing teeth was 3.59 (95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 11.7) after adjustment of obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Our results suggest that hypertension may be an important factor linking tooth loss and an increased risk of vascular diseases in postmenopausal women.(Hypertension. 2004;43:1297-1300.) Key Words: vascular diseases, hypertension, women","Vascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular diseases are important causes of death in elderly women in Japan as well as in the United States. Premenopausal women are relatively at low risk for vascular diseases compared with men, but this risk increases with advancing age and with the onset of menopause.1 Risk factors for vascular diseases include menopause, smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension in women. Tooth loss has been associated with an increased risk of vascular diseases such as coronary heart disease,2–4 cerebrovascular disease,5,6 and peripheral arterial disease.7 One potential pathway linking tooth loss and vascular disease risk is oral infection-inflammation related to periodontal disease.6–18 Periodontal disease, a local chronic bacterial infection in the oral cavity, may contribute to endothelial dysfunction,12 carotid artery plaque formation,11,13,15,17 or deterioration of the antiatherogenic potency of HDL.18 A second pathway is that tooth loss may affect dietary quality and nutrient intake, leading to an increased risk of vascular diseases.19–21 A third is confounding variables such as smoking or diabetes mellitus that largely affect both tooth loss and vascular diseases may produce spurious association between 2 phenomena.22–25 Tooth loss might lead to dietary pattern change, resulting in an increased risk of hypertension because the change of dietary pattern may be associated with hypertension.26 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure are important predictors for cardiovascular disease and stroke in the United States and Europe as well as in eastern Asia.27–30 Hypertension might be an important risk factor linking tooth loss and vascular disease risk in postmenopausal women. An analysis of postmenopausal, nonsmoking women without diabetes mellitus and clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis would be of interest to explore this hypothesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether tooth loss is associated with an increased risk of hypertension in postmenopausal women. Methods Subjects We evaluated 2 age-matched groups: 67 postmenopausal women with missing teeth (mean age SD 54.85.4 years, range 44 to 68 years) and 31 postmenopausal women without missing teeth (mean age 53.44 years, range 46 to 64 years). Because third molars tend to be impacted completely or missed congenitally, these were excluded from tooth count. All of the subjects had no menstruation for at least 1 year. Thirty women had hysterectomy, 10 had lateral oophorectomy, and 14 had bilateral oophorectomy. Excluded from the study were cigarette smokers and women with diabetes mellitus, clinical manifestations of arteriosclerosis (cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, or cerebrovascular disease), liver disorders, significant renal impairment, trauma in the jaws, and orthodontic treatment. None had used medications that affect lipid metabolism or blood pressure. Subjects with secondary forms of hypertension were excluded on the basis of a complete history and physical examination, radiological and ultrasound examinations, and urinalysis. All subjects had at least graduated from a junior high school (years of education 9). All subjects gave informed consent before inclusion. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Hiroshima University. Analytical Methods Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg measured in a sitting position on at least 3 different occasions in the outpatient clinic of Hiroshima University School of Medicine. Normal blood pressure was defined as a systolic blood pressure 130 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure 80 mm Hg. Routine chemical methods were used to determine the serum concentration of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (TGs). The serum concentration of LDL cholesterol was determined by the Friedewald method.31 Plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity was measured with ACE color (Fujirebio Co, Ltd). Plasma renin activity and plasma concentration of angiotensin II were determined by radioimmunoassay. Resting heart rate, height, and weight were measured at sampling venous blood. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by the square of height (kilograms per meter squared). Statistical Analysis All characteristics were compared between subjects with and without missing teeth by unpaired t test, 2 test, or Fisher exact test. Subjects were divided into subgroups according to measurement values for vascular disease risk. Low BMI was defined as 18.5 kg/m2, normal as 18.5 to 25 kg/m2, overweight as 25 to 30 kg/m2, and obese as 30 kg/m2. Total cholesterol 220 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 40 mg/dL, TG 150 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 140 mg/dL were considered traditional risk categories for vascular diseases. All traditional risk categories for vascular diseases were compared with tooth category by the 2 test or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio of having hypertension in subjects with missing teeth after adjustment of traditional risk categories for vascular diseases. P values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 8.0 (SPSS). Results There were significant differences in the number of remaining teeth (P0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (P0.021) between subjects with and without missing teeth. Subjects without missing teeth tended to have lower systolic blood pressure than did subjects with missing teeth (P0.058); however, there were no significant differences in other characteristics between the 2 groups (Table 1). There was significant association between an incidence of hypertension and tooth loss (P0.029); however, there were no significant associations among other traditional risk categories for vascular diseases and tooth loss (Table 2). After adjustment of other risk categories, the odds ratio of having hypertension in subjects with missing teeth was 3.59 (95% CI, 1.10 to 11.7). Discussion Tooth loss was significantly associated with an increased risk of hypertension in this study; however, there were no significant associations among other traditional risk factors for vascular diseases and tooth loss. This is the first demonstration that refers to an association between hypertension and tooth loss in postmenopausal women. The Eastern Stroke and Coronary Heart Disease Collaborative Research Group demonstrated that blood pressure is an important determinant of stroke risk in eastern Asian populations, whereas cholesterol concentration is less important, affecting the proportions of stroke subtypes more than overall stroke numbers.27 Franklin et al reported that diastolic blood pressure was the strongest predictor of coronary heart disease in patients younger than 50 years of age, whereas systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure were comparable predictors in patients aged 50 to 59 years in different age groups of the Framingham Heart Study participants.30 Diastolic blood pressure was significantly associated with tooth loss in our subjects who were relatively younger postmenopausal women. Our results suggest that postmenopausal women with missing teeth may have a higher risk of hypertension and subsequent vascular diseases than do those without missing teeth. On the basis of causal relationship, some hypotheses might be considered potential mechanisms linking tooth loss and an increased risk of hypertension. Intake of some nutrient-rich foods and beta carotene, folate, and vitamin C serum levels were significantly lower in denture wearers in the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population.32 The decrease of serum antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C in postmenopausal women with missing teeth in this study might contribute to an increased risk of hypertension. Subjects with missing teeth might have been at greater risk of periodontal disease than those without missing teeth, resulting in endothelial dysfunction through the oral infection-inflammation pathway and subsequent increased risk of hypertension. How-ever, because Saito et al reported significant association between obesity and periodontitis in Japanese men and women,33 there is less possibility that subjects with missing teeth had risk of periodontal disease than those without missing teeth at the time of examination in this study because there was no significant difference in obesity between subjects with and without missing teeth. Further, relatively younger women lost their teeth more likely by caries than by periodontal disease.34 Tooth loss might be a reflection of previously continuous pain and mental stress that may contribute to an increased risk of hypertension.35,36 However, there was no previous study that can support such a hypothesis in postmenopausal women. There were no significant differences in plasma ACE activity, plasma renin activity, or plasma angiotensin II concentration between subjects with and without missing teeth. These findings suggest that unknown mechanisms linking tooth loss and an increased risk of hypertension are at least not related to renin-angiotensin system. On the basis of noncausal relationship, healthy bias might be considered 1 of confounding variables linking tooth loss and hypertension in this study. Postmenopausal women without missing teeth might have both good general and oral health consciousness compared with those with missing teeth, resulting in spurious association between tooth loss and hypertension. However, there were no significant differences in other risk factors for vascular diseases as well as basic characteristics between subjects with and without missing teeth. These suggest that tooth loss–hypertension association in this study may not be a spurious finding because of healthy bias. The number of years of education was a significant independent predictor of the number of teeth remaining in white postmenopausal women.37 Al-Mahroos et al reported that educational status may be associated with hypertension in a cross-sectional survey of 2120 Bahrainis aged 40 to 69 years.38 Mizuno et al reported that Japanese postmenopausal women who graduated only from primary school tended to have lost more teeth than those who graduated from primary school or more.39 Because all subjects in this study had at least graduated from a junior high school, it is unlikely that educational status may be the confounding variable linking tooth loss and hypertension in this study. This study has some design limitations. First, our subjects are not representative of Japanese postmenopausal women. Our findings are limited to relatively healthy postmenopausal women because of restrictive exclusion criteria. A small number of subjects also may limit the interpretation of our findings. Second, we did not clarify the difference in the dietary patterns between subjects with and without missing teeth. Third, we did not measure endothelial function in this study. The estimation of dietary patterns and the measurement of endothelial function would be necessary to clarify as to which mechanisms contribute to an association between tooth loss and an increased risk of hypertension in postmenopausal women. In conclusion, there was significant association between tooth loss and an increased risk of hypertension in postmenopausal women, although there were no significant associations among tooth loss and other traditional risk factors for vascular diseases. Our results suggest that hypertension may be an important factor linking tooth loss and vascular disease risk in postmenopausal women. Perspectives Tooth loss was associated with an increased risk of hypertension in postmenopausal women. However, it was still unknown whether there was causal link between 2 phenomena because this study was cross-sectional. Some unknown confounding variables related to socioeconomic status, nutritional features, psychosocial factors, or lifestyle might contribute to non causal association. At the point of causal relationship, hypertension also might facilitate tooth loss. The strategy for tooth retention might play an important role in preventing hypertension and subsequent vascular diseases after menopause in women. Conversely, treating hypertension at an earlier age might promote tooth retention. Prospective longitudinal study including possible confounding variables would clarify the causal or noncausal relationship between tooth loss and hypertension in postmenopausal women.

"Relationship Between Periodontal Disease, Tooth Loss, and Carotid Artery Plaque: The Oral Infections and Vascular Disease Epidemiology Study (INVEST)","Mose Desvarieux, MD, PhD; Ryan T. Demmer, MPH; Tatjana Rundek, MD, PhD; Bernadette Boden-Albala, DrPH; David R. Jacobs, Jr, PhD; Panos N. Papapanou, DDS, PhD; Ralph L. Sacco, MD, MS","Background and Purpose: Chronic infections, including periodontal infections, may predispose to cardiovascular disease.The present study investigates the relationship of periodontal disease and tooth loss with subclinical atherosclerosis. Methods: We enrolled 711 subjects with a mean age of 66-9 years and no history of stroke or myocardial infarction in the Oral Infections and Vascular Disease Epidemiology Study. Subjects received a comprehensive periodontal examination, extensive in-person cardiovascular disease risk factor measurements, and a carotid scan using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound. Regression models were adjusted for conventional risk factors (age, sex, smoking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, race-ethnicity, education, physical activity) and markers of cultural background, healthy lifestyle, and psychosocial health. Results: Measures of both current and cumulative periodontitis became more severe as tooth loss increased. A significant association was observed between tooth loss levels and carotid artery plaque prevalence. Among those with 0 to 9 missing teeth, 46% had carotid artery plaque, whereas among those with>10 missing teeth, carotid artery plaque prevalence was=60% (P=0.05). Conclusions: Our data suggest that tooth loss is a marker of past periodontal disease in this population and is related to subclinical atherosclerosis, thereby providing a potential pathway for a relationship with clinical events.(Stroke. 2003;34:2120-2125.). Key Words: atherosclerosis, infection, periodontal disease, tooth loss","Several investigators have suggested that chronic infections may predispose to cardiovascular disease (CVD).1,2 The relationship between oral health, specifically periodontal disease, and CVD has been a subject of mounting research in recent years 3–10 and is both biologically plausible and supported by data on transient bacteremia and elevated inflammatory markers.11–13 Studies have reported associations between CVD events and periodontal infections 5.7,14–16 or tooth loss.7,17–21 However, recent studies have cast doubt on the relationship.9,10,22–25 The inconsistency may be due to differences in study design, definition of periodontitis, outcome examined, and residual confounding (possibly by smoking).25 Alternatively, including socioeconomic status as a covariate 10 may constitute overadjustment because socioeconomic status is a surrogate marker for several characteristics. Age adjustment must also be done carefully because not only is age positively related to both periodontitis and CVD, but tooth loss resulting from treatment for periodontitis may also occur differentially according to age. The Oral Infections and Vascular Disease Epidemiology Study (INVEST) was designed to study the hypothesis that periodontal infections predispose to accelerated progression of carotid atherosclerosis and incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, and CVD death. In this report, we hypothesize that in older adults, edentulism and loss of more than a few teeth mark past periodontitis not visible in current observation because tooth removal was the result of either severe infection or the elimination of the site of infection. As a consequence of the dual and conflicting reasons for tooth loss, clinical measures of periodontal disease may be more difficult to interpret as an exposure of significance for systemic diseases. In this article, we present cross-sectional data to study (1) the extent to which tooth loss is concordant with current and cumulative measures of periodontitis and (2) the relationship of the conventional clinical measures of periodontitis (pocket depth and clinical attachment loss [AL]) and tooth loss to the presence of carotid artery plaque. Our study collected extensive data on oral disease, traditional cardiovascular and periodontal risk factors, and markers of healthy behaviors, psychosocial health, and healthcare background; this study was able to include as covariates many variables identified as potential confounders in other studies.21 Particular attention was paid to assessing the confounding role of smoking.25 Materials and Methods INVEST is a prospective population-based cohort study investigating the relationship between oral infections, carotid atherosclerosis, and stroke. Subjects were randomly selected from northern Manhattan, an area between 145th and 218th streets, bordered on the west by the Hudson River and separated on the east from the Bronx by the Harlem River. Blacks, Hispanics, and whites live together in this area and have access to similar medical care. INVEST participants are also enrolled in the Northern Manhattan Study.26 Eligibility criteria for INVEST are as follows: (1) white, black, or Hispanic resident (3 months) of northern Manhattan (ZIP codes 10031, 10032, 10033, 10034, and 10040); (2) contacted by random-digit dialing among households with a telephone (all eligible invited); (3) age 55 years at the time of the first in-person assessment; (4) no baseline history of stroke, myocardial infarction, or chronic inflammatory conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Lyme disease, gonococcal arthritis, or bacterial endocarditis; and (5) ability to come to the clinic. The planned number of INVEST participants is 1050. We report here on the first 711 enrolled participants. An additional 17 participants were deleted in some adjusted analyses because of missing smoking information. This study was approved by the Institutional Review boards, and all subjects granted informed consent. Dental History and Oral Examination At baseline, subjects were interviewed and underwent a complete examination of the oral cavity administered by trained, calibrated dental examiners. Tooth brushing and flossing were recorded as times per week. Edentulous participants reported brushing (gums or dentures) but not flossing (and thus were removed from flossing analyses). Teeth were counted and localized. Gingival crevicular fluid (mesial buccal site in the most posterior tooth per quadrant) and plaque samples (2 most posterior teeth, mesial lingual in the upper and mesial buccal in the lower jaw) were collected before probing. Assessment of periodontal status for all teeth present included presence or absence of dental plaque, probing depth (PD) in millimeters, and location of the gingival margin in relation to the cementoenamel junction at 6 locations for each tooth (mesiobuccal, mid buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual, distolingual) with a UNC-15 manual probe (Hu-Friedy). A visual check for cavities and tooth mobility was performed. Finally, oral/pharyngeal soft tissue was examined to detect mucosal inflammatory conditions. In this article, we categorized dentate subjects according to the extent of current (as measured by PD) and cumulative (as measured by AL) periodontal disease. Disease was defined at a particular level of severity, namely 5 mm for PD and 4 mm for AL. Disease extent was defined by the percent of periodontal sites meeting the above severity criteria for PD and AL. The percent of sites was calculated within each mouth by dividing the number of sites with PD 5 mm by the total number of sites measured, and similarly for AL. Tooth loss was categorized as 0 to 9, 10 to 19, and 20 to 31 missing teeth and edentulous. These cutoffs resulted in a balanced distribution of subjects across tooth loss categories (Table 1). Assessment of Carotid Artery Plaque and Maximal Carotid Plaque Thickness Carotid ultrasound was performed by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound system GE LogIQ 700 with a multifrequency 9/13-MHz linear-array probe. Both right and left carotid arteries were assessed by trained and certified sonologists using previously described 27 protocols. The carotid artery scanning protocol consisted of imaging the carotid arteries in the longitudinal (anterior, lateral, posterior views) and transverse planes. The examination consisted of an initial exploratory transverse and longitudinal scan of the carotid system, followed by a detailed longitudinal examination of the specific arterial segments. Both common (CCA) and internal (ICA) carotid arteries were examined for the presence of atherosclerotic plaque, defined as an area of focal wall thickening. All images were recorded on super-VHS tapes for reading. The carotid plaque reading protocol was performed offline. Measurements of maximal carotid plaque thickness (in millimeters) were performed at the highest plaque prominence in any of the 3 carotid artery segments assessed from the digitized multi angled images. If no carotid plaques were identified, plaque thickness was recorded as zero. For these analyses, the presence or absence (prevalence) of carotid artery plaque and maximal plaque thickness were used. Reading of carotid intima media wall thickness is ongoing and not yet available. Risk Factor Assessment Data were collected through interview by trained research assistants, medical record reviews, physical and neurological examination by study physicians, in-person measurements, and fasting (overnight) blood specimens. All assessments were conducted in English or Spanish. Race-ethnicity was based on self-identification through US census–based interview questions. Subjects were categorized into Hispanic, white non-Hispanic, or black non-Hispanic. Subjects were interviewed regarding socio demographic characteristics, stroke risk factors, and other medical conditions. Standardized questions were adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System regarding the following conditions: hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, transient ischemic attack, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and cardiac conditions such as myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, angina, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmias, and valvular heart disease. Subjects also completed a comprehensive functional status battery, which included the Barthel Activities of Daily Living, Quality of Well-Being, and Geriatric Social Readjustment Rating scales. Anthropometric measurements of height and weight were determined with calibrated scales. Research assistants measured blood pressure using a calibrated aneroid sphygmomanometer (Omron), and the average of 2 measurements was used in analysis.26 Hypertension was defined by the patient’s self-report of a history of diagnosed hypertension or use of antihypertensive medications or if mean systolic blood pressure was 140 mm Hg or mean diastolic blood pressure was 90 mm Hg. Blood samples were sent for complete blood count on enrollment. Fasting glucose and lipid panels were measured as described.26 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was computed from the Friedewald equation.28 Diabetes mellitus was defined as a history of diagnosed diabetes, use of insulin or hypoglycemic medication, or a fasting glucose 126 mg/dL (7.7 mmol/L). Smoking was assessed both categorically (current, former, or never) and continuously as total pack-years of cigarette smoking. Furthermore, among ever smokers, the following data were also collected: smoking duration (computed as the difference between the age at smoking initiation and the age at smoking cessation) and quantity of cigarettes smoked per day. Assessment of Cultural, Lifestyle, and Social Isolation Variables Cultural background was assessed as country of origin and years of residence in northern Manhattan (categorized 5 or 5 years). A physical activity survey was adapted from the National Health Interview Survey of the National Center for Health Statistics, considered reliable in evaluating elderly subjects.29 It records the frequency and duration of 14 recreational activities during the 2-week period before the interview. Physical activity level was categorized as none, light, moderate, or heavy. Five social isolation variables were examined: (1) marital status (currently married versus not); (2) number of friends known well enough to visit in the subject’s home (0 to 1 versus 2); (3) number of visitors in the past week (visiting at the subject’s house or at the friend’s house or going out together; 0 to 1 versus 2); (4) feeling lonely (quite often or sometimes versus almost never); and (5) number of members in the household. Statistical Analysis All analyses were performed with SAS for Windows, version 8.0. Linear and logistic regression models were used as appropriate. The number of missing teeth per mouth was modeled both continuously and categorically. We estimated the percent of individuals with any carotid plaque and odds ratios between tooth loss categories using logistic regression. The natural logarithm (maximum carotid artery plaque thickness plus 1) was studied with linear regression. We defined age both continuously and categorically by 5-year intervals in preliminary analyses. The 2 definitions of age produced similar results; all models presented here are adjusted for age as a continuous variable. Results General Characteristics Of the 711 participants, 58% were women, and men were younger (658 versus 679 years) (P0.007). The study population was triethnic, with 64% Hispanic, 21% black non-Hispanic, and 15% white non-Hispanic. Ninety-five percent of Hispanics were foreign born, with most (64%) from the Dominican Republic. Additional characteristics of the study participants are given in Table 1. Fifty-five percent of subjects had plaque detected in at least 1 carotid artery: 54% in the ICA and 6% in the CCA. Average plaque thickness size was 0.740.86 mm and was similar in both sexes. The age-adjusted carotid artery plaque prevalence was 59% in men versus 53% in women (P0.06). This sex difference was seen in both the CCA (9% versus 4%, P0.0009) and ICA (58% versus 51%, P0.06). Adjusting for age and sex showed that plaque was both more prevalent and of greater size among whites (64%, 0.90 mm) than blacks (58%, 0.84 mm) and Hispanics (53%, 0.67 mm) (P0.05 for any difference among ethnic groups). Seventy-nine percent of the participants (n562) were dentate and had an average of 148 missing teeth. Whites had more teeth (17) than Hispanics (14) or blacks (14) (P0.01). The average number of periodontal sites (SD) with PD 5 mm or AL 4 mm was 1116 and 3527 respectively. The distribution was similar in both sexes. Relationship Between Tooth Loss and Clinical Measures of Periodontal Disease The greater the number of teeth lost, the greater the extent of severe periodontal disease was. Across increasing levels of tooth loss, there was a consistent increase in the age-adjusted proportion of sites with both severe AL (from 28% to 59%) and deep pockets (from 8% to 15%) (Table 2). Conventional Measures of Periodontal Disease, Tooth Loss, and Carotid Artery Plaque Carotid plaque prevalence was not clearly related to the conventional measures of current and past periodontal disease. The percentage of participants with any carotid artery plaque present was 55% at all levels of both current and cumulative measures of periodontal disease extent (data not shown). Among those with 0 to 9 missing teeth, 45% had carotid artery plaque, whereas among those with 10 missing teeth, the prevalence of carotid artery plaque was 60% (Table 3), even after adjustment for standard CVD risk factors. Models adjusting for social isolation, oral hygiene, years of residence, and physical activity barely changed carotid artery plaque prevalence estimates across tooth loss categories. This relationship between tooth loss and carotid plaque prevalence was more pronounced in patients older than the median age of 65 years (the Figure). Carotid artery plaque thickness mirrored plaque prevalence across tooth loss categories; however, this finding was solely reflective of prevalence. Our findings were similar among the subgroup of 326 never smokers: Carotid plaque was present in 39% of those with 0 to 9 missing teeth, 52% of those with 10 to 19 missing teeth, 48% of those with 20 to 31 missing teeth, and 58% of the edentulous. After adjustment for sex, age, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, LDL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), race-ethnicity, and education, the association was attenuated but retained the same pattern: 42%, 52%, 45%, and 52%, respectively, had carotid plaque. Among the entire population, the percentage with any plaque was effectively unchanged whatever the form of the smoking-adjusting variable: smoking status (never, ex-, current smoker) alone; smoking status and pack-years; or smoking status, time since cessation, cigarettes per day, and smoking duration. Discussion We investigated and clarified the relationship between tooth loss and clinical measures of periodontal disease, thus providing a novel epidemiological explanation for conflicting results in the literature linking periodontal disease and CVD. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first article to identify a relationship between tooth loss and subclinical CVD. A recent publication showed increased risk of stroke in those with substantial numbers of missing teeth.17 A number of other analyses have reported on tooth loss and CVD previously.7,18–20 All but 1 of these reports 17 examined tooth loss exposure simply as a dichotomous variable. These studies have focused primarily on the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and prevalent coronary heart disease in relation to tooth loss, whereas we have used subclinical atherosclerosis as the primary outcome in a cohort free of baseline cardiovascular disease. Therefore, our findings shed light on a potential pathway through which oral health may affect vascular diseases. Here, we report on the nonlinear relationship between tooth loss and carotid plaque. Our analyses reveal that the prevalence of carotid plaque increases substantially and peaks among individuals missing 10 to 19 teeth compared with those missing 0 to 9 teeth before abating somewhat in the 2 groups with the most substantial tooth loss. This subclinical pattern is similar to that observed recently for the clinical stroke end point.17 This curvilinearity may be due to the fact that people lose sets of teeth for various reasons. Although the first teeth might be lost because of caries or orthodontic reasons, we hypothesized that in older adults, edentulism or loss of more than a few teeth would more likely reflect periodontal disease, and our data seem to support that supposition. Tooth loss may be a valid and more telling marker of long-term cumulative periodontal disease in certain populations. However, tooth loss is a difficult marker to grasp epidemiologically because it may mark the result of periodontal treatment, severe disease, or both. In populations in which tooth loss is due primarily to periodontal disease, this may lead to an apparent paradox in which edentulous patients are not significantly different from the dentate patients with the most periodontal disease.9 In other words, when one loses teeth previously affected by periodontal disease, the evidence of the cumulative effect of periodontitis is removed while the systemic damage may partly persist. The possibility that the systemic damage may not be entirely reversible should not be interpreted as evidence of no damage. This varied removal of the proof of periodontal disease exposure may partially explain the discrepancy between epidemiological studies reporting on periodontal-systemic relationships. However, because tooth removal practices vary, we caution that tooth loss may not carry the same relation with periodontal disease and consequently vascular disease in all populations. For example, AL and PD may be better markers of periodontal disease in some possibly younger population groups. This would be consistent with the findings by Mattila et al3 and with our own data in which age was the most important covariate in the relationship between tooth loss and carotid artery plaque. Age plays an epidemiologically confusing role in that it may both increase and decrease risk for CVD: Aging subjects are more likely to develop periodontitis and the ensuing tooth loss but may also be more likely to have their teeth removed for similarly severe periodontal disease compared with younger subjects. Whether age is an explanatory variable or a confounding variable cannot be determined in a cross-sectional design. Thus, we await prospective results from INVEST to make firmer conclusions. Our analysis was systematic in adjusting for risk factors and healthy behaviors, cultural background, and psychosocial health. None of them removed the relationship of tooth loss with carotid artery plaque prevalence. Furthermore, the nature and scope of the relationship was unaffected by careful assessment of the confounding role of smoking. We have used cutoffs of 4 mm for AL and 5 mm for PD to measure the severity of clinical periodontal disease. These cutoffs reflected our data and the disease prevalence in our population. Had we chosen a threshold of 3 mm, as done by others,30 90% of our population would have been classified as having severe periodontal disease. This study shares with others the limitations inherent to cross-sectional data; the relationships reported here, while robust, should not be interpreted as causal. Also, diet data, although collected, were not yet available. This study specifically reports on assessments of carotid artery plaque rather than intima-media thickness (IMT). Beck et al30 have reported on the relationship between intima-media thickness and periodontal measures but not with tooth loss. It is possible that part of the reported relationship by these authors may have been accounted for by plaque because the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) protocol integrates plaque thickness in the measurement of IMT. Because IMT and plaque are measured separately in INVEST, we will be able to investigate their relative contributions. Our findings raise the possibility that such a relationship might not be entirely reversible or may require supplemental measures to be reversible. Our results also suggest a threshold effect over which the cumulative effect of periodontal disease may plateau. Further knowledge should be garnered when we report on the progression of atherosclerosis with regard to prospective tooth loss and local microbiological and inflammatory markers of periodontitis. A relationship between periodontitis and subclinical CVD, as reported here, would be of significant public health interest because of the prevalence of periodontitis in the general population.4,31 Acknowledgments This research is supported by NIH grants DE-13094 and NS-29993.

The association of tooth loss with all-cause and circulatory mortality. Is there a benefit of replaced teeth? A systematic review and meta-analysis,Ines Polzer & Christian Schwahn & Henry Völzke & Torsten Mundt & Reiner Biffar,"We systematically reviewed whether the number of teeth is related to all-cause or circulatory mortality and whether replaced teeth are protective against all-cause or circulatory mortality. The search was based on the PubMed database. All cohort studies published in peer-reviewed journals were selected. Studies on periodontal disease and mortality were excluded if they did not provide information on the number of teeth. Risk estimates from studies with appropriate exposure definition, confounder adjustment and sample size were included in a meta-analysis. Three high-quality studies found a relationship between the number of teeth and circulatory mortality, whereas a moderate study did not. Two out of four moderate- to high-quality studies reported a relationship between the number of teeth and all-cause mortality. No study has investigated whether replaced teeth are protective against mortality. Therefore, denture use was taken as proxy. The methodological quality of studies on denture use and mortality was generally low to moderate. The findings of two moderate studies indicate an effect of prosthodontic replacements on all-cause mortality, which was supported in bias analysis. It is open whether competing risks of cause-specific death other than circulatory mortality reduce an effect of the number of teeth on all-cause mortality. An effect of denture use on circulatory mortality remains to be established, as well as whether the number of replaced teeth affects mortality.Specifying the role of potential pathways by which tooth loss-related mortality is mediated will possibly increase the value of dental treatment for general health.Keywords Mortality.Prospective studies.Dental Prosthesis.Tooth loss.Meta-analysis","The number of teeth is discussed to predict all-cause and circulatory mortality. Two major pathways may mediate this relationship, including (1) the effects of masticatory dysfunction on dietary behaviour, nutrition and systemic diseases [1–4] and (2) the inflammatory effects of chronic periodontal infection on the circulatory system [5–7]. If Tooth loss was a risk factor, it's attributable fraction will be relevant because it is more common [8], from younger age onwards, than hypertension [9] as one of the primary predictors of circulatory mortality.The role of the prosthodontic status has been rarely examined for the possible relationship between the number of teeth and mortality [10]. If the rehabilitation of missing teeth by wearing dental prostheses has the potential to change masticatory efficiency and diet [11–13], replacing missing teeth may hypothetically have an effect on mortality. The prosthodontic status is a time-dependent exposure, as further tooth loss may occur or missing teeth be replaced. If tooth loss is measured at baseline only, it risk on mortality is underestimated because some subjects will improve their prosthodontic status (receive a prosthesis for missing teeth during the observation period) and some subjects will deteriorate (loose teeth during the observation period without replacement). Such non-differential misclassification following the baseline examination was described earlier for the risk of periodontal disease on cardiovascular disease [14]. Consequently, a long observation period is not only linked with a higher chance for changes in the dental status but it is also preferable to observe fatal events.A highly relevant methodological factor for judging whether tooth loss or prosthodontic replacement plays a causal role for mortality is to consider the concept of confounding. A confounder is related both to the outcome and the exposure, and non-considering a confounder may overestimate the exposure effect. On the other hand, aconfounder may also suppress the relationship of interest.To choose appropriate confounder sets, an innovative epidemiologic tool, namely, directed acyclic graphs(DAGs), has been suggested [15–17]. This combined analytical and graphical approach allows alternative con-founder sets and may be particularly instructive for systematic reviews.Based on these methodological aspects, we systematically reviewed (1) whether the number of teeth is related to all-cause or circulatory mortality and (2) whether replaced teeth are protective against all-cause or circulatory mortality.Materials and methods Search strategy Literature searches were independently executed by three of the authors (I.P., C.S. and H.V.) using two strategies.Firstly, the PubMed database (1966 to May 2010) was screened to detect articles published in the English Language on the association between the number of teeth and all-cause mortality/circulatory mortality or replaced teeth and all-cause mortality/circulatory mortality. The Search was restricted to studies on human subjects by selecting the respective option provided by the PubMed search engine. For assessing a putative lifetime effect of the number of teeth, the Boolean search formulation was:(toothORteethOR“tooth loss”OR“tooth number”OR“number of teeth”OR“dental disease”OR“dental status”)AND (survival OR mortality OR death OR fatal OR lethal). To evaluate a putative beneficial effect of prosthodontic replacements, the Boolean search formulation was:(“replaced teeth”ORdentureOR“dental prosthesis”OR“dental prostheses”ORRPDORFPD) AND (survival OR mortality OR death OR fatal OR lethal).Secondly, after the electronic search, manual searches were made through reference lists from original research and review articles.Study selectionAll cohort studies published in peer-reviewed journals were considered for the present review. Studies on the association between the number of teeth and non-fatal circulatory events were excluded, as were studies on periodontal disease and mortality if they did not provide information on the number of teeth. Highly selected study populations were a further criterion for exclusion.Quality assessment of selected studies The selected studies were assessed for the exposure, the intermediates, the sample size and the confounders. With Respect to confounding, we classified the studies into risk and prediction models [18]. In a risk model, a confounder is associated with both the outcome and the exposure, but must not be an effect of the exposure [19]. To assess a confounder,it would not be appropriate to use stepwise selection procedures because they ignore the relation between the risk factor and the exposure. Stepwise modelling makes more sense for prediction models [19]. The sample size is considered insufficient if less than ten outcome events per variable were available in prediction models or five events per variable in risk models [20]. If the number of events is less than the corresponding critical value, the results may be biased and should be cautiously interpreted [20].Potential confounders Many confounders (age [21, 22], sex [21, 22], social determinants such as socioeconomic status (SES) and marital status [22, 23], smoking [21–24], risky alcohol consumption[23, 24], physical activity [23, 25], metabolic factors such as diabetes and obesity [21–23], serum lipids such as triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [26, 27], hypertension [22, 28], oral health behaviour [23, 25], periodontitis [29, 30]andcaries[31]) have been considered for the relationship between the number of teeth and mortality. To reduce such a high number of potential confounders to minimal adjustment sets that are sufficient to control confounding, the DAG approach was used [16, 17]; for example, in Online Fig.1 (Online Resource 1, p 9), the DAG for the teeth–mortality relation is drawn(generated by DAGitty v0.9b available athttp://www.dagitty.net/dags.html). The confounder selection depends on the exposure of interest [19]. We investigated the effect of the number of teeth (I) or related oral exposures (number of contacts on natural teeth, II; presence of prostheses, III;number of unreplaced teeth, IV). The obtained minimally sufficient adjustment sets for different oral exposures (I–IV)used in selected studies and under different assumptions are presented in Online Table 1 (Online Resource 1,p7). The DAG approach clarifies that an exposure mixture of oral variables may be misleading. Moreover, the problem of residual confounding by smoking, which has been extensively discussed for the relationship between oral exposures and circulatory outcomes, may potentially be avoided by using DRUGs.Based on extensive DAG analysis, smoking and diabetes as the clinically most important (except periodontal disease)were considered for the quality assessment of studies with the exposure to the number of teeth. Age, sex, social determinants (SES) and the number of teeth were considered for the quality assessment of the studies on denture use or related exposures.Additional methodological information on the selection of potential confounders based on DAGs is given in Online Resource 1 (pp 2 and 3).Quality criteria Exposure and intermediates (A–D)(A) Empirical induction period.

Since the relation between the number of natural or replaced teeth and mortality should not be examined within the scope of randomised clinical trials for ethical reasons, the highest possible level of recommendation is B, evidence based on cohort studies. Given evidence based on low- to moderate-quality cohort studies, the level of recommendation will be C.Bias analysis of the putative relationship between prosthodontic replacements and mortality, SES maybe an important confounder,which is supported by DAGs (Online Resource 1, OnlineTable1, p 7). If published results were not adjusted for SES,the effect of missing prosthodontic replacements on mortality is likely to be overestimated. The lack of confounder control can be diminished by bias analyses as recommended by experts for meta-analysis [34]. Here, we performed a probabilistic bias analysis [35] and chose study-specific bias assumptions as described in the supplementary material(Online Resource 1, pp 3 and 4). To decide for a relevant bias, we used the change-in-estimate criterion for risk models,which is usually fixed for a 10% change [19]. The simulation estimate and its interval, which are reflections of the combined data and bias analysis assumptions, were added to the conventional estimate and confidence interval in Table 2.Result General description of selected studies Applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, in total, 23 cohort studies [36–58] were selected for qualitative synthesis (Fig.1).As to the database search on tooth loss and mortality, six investigations [37, 38, 42, 54, 58, 59] were assigned to the denture use analysis. Other studies were not considered since they assessed tooth loss solely as an exposure category of periodontal disease [60–64], treated the number of teeth as a score variable [65, 66] or a confounding variable only [67] or no quantitative data have been given[68, 69]. One study was excluded for evaluating only incident tooth loss [70]. Between two studies [43, 44], an overlap of 94 subjects existed. Because the exposures were defined differently, both reports were included. Finally,three studies [25, 71, 72] were excluded for not assessing fatal events of disease separately from non-fatal outcomes.There was no study on the relationship between the number of replaced teeth and mortality. Therefore, denture use was taken as proxy. As to the eligibility of denture-related studies,on investigation [59] was excluded, being based on data also used in another publication [37]. Two studies reported no quantitative data and were, therefore, not included [57, 60].A descriptive summary of the selected studies is given in Tables 1 and 2; declared risk factors were not restricted to those in the final model. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe [37, 40, 43–46, 49, 50, 52, 55–57]orJapan[38,41, 42, 48, 54, 58], four in the United States [39, 47, 51, 53]and one in China [36]. Study participants were recruited from the general population [36–46, 48–53, 57, 58], nursing facilities [54], registers [47, 55]andhra university hospital[56]. Sample sizes ranged widely from 94 [43]to41,000 subjects [39] in studies on all-cause mortality and from 1,462[40] to 58,974 subjects [47] in studies on circulatory mortality (Table1). In studies that considered denture ideas exposure, the range was 697 [38] to 1,929 subjects [54](Table2).Denture-related studies did not analyse circulatory mortality as outcome. Similarly, the follow-up times differedandwereatminimum5[43] or 6 years [47] and at maximum 57 years [56] in studies on all-cause or circulatory mortality(Table1). In studies exploring the putative relation between denture use and mortality (Table2), there were shorter observation periods of 4 [38]to15years[37].Number of teeth and all-cause/circulatory mortality There were 15 studies [36, 39–41, 43–46, 48–52, 55, 56]that investigated the relation between the number of teeth and all-cause mortality and 9 studies[36, 39, 40, 46, 47, 49, 52, 56,57] that investigated the effect on circulatory mortality(Table1). Irrespective of the assessed quality, 12 [36, 39–41,43–46, 49–51, 55] out of 15 studies reported an increased risk of unspecific death among women or men with higher numbers of missing teeth, while 7 [36, 39, 40, 46, 47, 49, 56]out of 9 studies revealed increased circulatory mortality.Study findings are limited by low number of events [20]in relation to the number of variables in the final model (forall-cause mortality: Table3 [48, 51] and for circulatory mortality: Table4 [57]). Notably, in one study [57], sample size considerations were not reported, although statistically non-significant findings were yielded for a low number of events. Findings are further limited by using prediction models [43, 44, 49–51, 55]. Moreover, the confounder sets of the studies were quite heterogeneous. Few risk models lacked adjustment for clinically relevant confounders such as smoking [39, 41] and diabetes [41, 46, 52](Tables 3 And 4).Potential residual confounding by smoking was addressed in three studies by performing sensitivity analysis [36], using the number of cigarettes per day for current and former smokers [47], or stratifying by smoking status [56]. Tu et al.[56] reported separate analyses for smokers and non-smokers only for the association between tooth loss and circulatory mortality; for that relationship, the methodological quality scoring was, therefore, higher (Table4)danforth all-cause mortality analyses (Table3). Four studies [39, 45, 46, 52]discussed residual confounding qualitatively without trying to quantify the effect, for instance, in a bias analysis.Quantification of the bias effect would have been advisable at least for Brown et al. [39]. In contrast, over-adjustment might be present for vitamin supplementation [47].Different exposure definitions, namely, dichotomous (for example, >10 teeth), log-linear (continuous number of teeth)or potentially non-log-linear (categories, fractional polynomials), were used across studies (Table1). Two studies [49,56], having found a higher mortality risk, specified whether a linear exposure effect could be assumed. Whereas one study[49] revealed linearity, the other did not [56]. Notably, in two studies [36, 50], the number of teeth was not examined by dental professionals. In a study of health professionals,participants indicated their number of teeth (0, 1–10, 11–16,17–24, 25–32 teeth) in a self-administered questionnaire[47]. Change in exposures or time-dependent variables were analysed by Hung et al. [47]only.All studies had an observation period of at least 5 years.Four studies followed up the population for more than 15 years [40, 45, 49, 56]. The empirical induction period was not analysed. The age ranged from 16 [56] to at least 85 years [43] at baseline. Some studies specifically investigated mortality in elderly (65–79 years) [45, 49,50] or very old populations (≥80 years) [43, 44, 48, 55].Two studies observed selected samples for which high health awareness may be assumed [47, 56].Quality of selected studies on the number of teeth and all-cause/circulatory mortality Summary results of the quality assessment are presented for studies on all-cause mortality in Table 3 and for studies on circulatory mortality in Table 4. There was a higher methodological quality of analyses on the relation between the number of teeth and circulatory mortality, which was moderate to high in half of all studies, compared with studies addressing all-cause mortality as outcome. Generally, lower quality scorings of the selected studies were partly attributable to a research question different from those of the present systematic review. Cabrera et al. [40],for example, assessed whether the SES can explain the relation between tooth loss and circulatory mortality; forthat aim (SES as exposure), smoking would be an intermediary variable rather than a confounder.Based on quality assessment, valid results for all-cause mortality can be assumed for Abnet et al. [36] and, to an essentially lower grade, for Holm-Pedersen et al. [45],Ragnarsson et al. [52] and Tu et al. [56]. Exposures differ across moderate- to high-quality studies [36, 45, 52, 56].Therefore, a pooled estimation would be feasible only fortwo moderate studies [52, 56], both analysing the number of teeth as continuous variable. Quantitative synthesis ignoring high-quality data could be misleading and was,therefore, not performed. Two [36, 45] out of four moderate- to high-quality studies (Table3), however,reported a relationship between the number of teeth and all-cause mortality (Table1).Valid results forcirculatory mortalitycan be assumed forAbnetetal.[36], Hung et al. [47]anaTometal.[56](Table4),who all have found a relationship between the exposure and the outcome (Table1) and, to an essentially lower grade, for Ragnarsson et al. [52], who revealed no relationship between the number of teeth and circulatory mortality. A meta-analysis of the studies was not feasible for similar reasons as for well-designed studies on all-cause mortality; discrepancy definitions of the exposures would demand exclusion of the two studies with the largest sample size [36, 47].Denture use and all-cause mortality study particularly investigated whether the number of replaced or replaced teeth affects mortality. Six investigations [37, 38, 42, 53, 54, 58] explored the putative relation between denture use and all-cause mortality. The Study of Semba et al. [53] was not further considered, since the exposure mixture to denture use and difficulty in chewing or swallowing was not suitable for the aim of our review. Four [37, 42, 54, 58] out of the remaining five studies yielded an increased risk of death among women ormen not using dentures (Table2). Interpretation of these findings is, however, limited by the methodological quality of the analyses (Table5). One study [58] controlled only forage and gender for each exposure group (but additionally controlled tooth contacts for the exposure to denture use)and each study lacked adjustment for gender [37], age [37]or SES, including education and income [38, 42, 54, 58].Only one study used risk modelling approaches [42]. None of the studies followed up the population longer than 15 years. The empirical induction period was not analysed by any of the studies. Most studies addressed mortality in old (65–79 years) [37, 54, 58] or very old adults (≥80 years)[38] and one of those specifically referred to institutionalised elderly [54].Quality of selected studies on denture use and all-cause mortality Quality estimates of the studies that considered denture use or related exposures in the relationship between dental status and all-cause mortality are presented in Table 5. Based on the proposed criteria, the quality scoring was low to moderate. This quality scoring was improved using bias analysis (Table5). A valid statement on the effect of denture use on all-cause mortality can only be assumed fortwo Japanese studies [42, 58], which found that denturenon-use is a risk factor for mortality. These exposure effects were changed less than 10% by SES in bias analyses (data are given in Online Resource 1, Online Table2, p 8), which was expected mainly because wealth inequalities were relatively low in Japan [73]. Therefore, we used the original estimates in meta-analysis. The pooled estimate assuming random effects of the overall risk in Yoshida et al. [58] and the two gender-specific risks in Fukai et al. [42] yielded a hazard ratio of 1.31 for denture non-users compared with denture users (95% CI 1.03;1.65, using EPISHEET developed by Rothman [19] version of June 11, 2008) (Fig.2), indicating an effect of prosthodontic replacements on mortality.Discussion In conducting a sound meta-analysis, we aimed for an average effect across studies by using well-established methods [34], which included state-of-the-art probabilistic bias analysis on study level [35]. The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis, however, must be considered in the context of the following potential limitations. The small number of studies available for analysis limits not only the generalisability of the results but also the application of methods for detecting bias in meta-analysis (for example, publication bias and language bias)[74]. Moreover, possible sex differences could not be addressed in the relation between oral health and circulatory outcomes. The small number of studies included in this review did not permit to evaluate the quality of the assessment for circulatory mortality. Furthermore, we cannot exclude potential bias in the original studies, for example,because of measurement error or misclassification of confounders.Number of teeth and all-cause/circulatory mortality The three high-quality studies [36,47, 56] (Table4)revealed a relationship between the number of teeth and circulatory mortality(Table1). Therefore, the recommendation regarding the number of teeth playing a causal role with respect to circulatory mortality is assessed as level B[32]. For the putative relationship between the number of teeth and all-cause mortality, only one high-quality study was found. Given the inconsistent results of moderate- and high-quality studies (Tables 1 and 3), a recommendation cannot be given [32].At least three biological mechanisms are suggested for the link between the number of teeth and mortality: (1)inflammation, (2) infection and (3) diet and nutrition (for further information about the biological mechanisms,please refer to the supplementary material [Online Resource 1, p 5]).Each aforementioned pathway relates to a specific confounder set and requires a corresponding induction period. If, for example, a nutritional pathway was taken, it would be unjustified to assume that having missing,unreplaced teeth instantly leads to death, but it would be reasonable to assume an induction period of at least 5 years,as suggested by two studies by Nakanishi and colleagues[75, 76]. They reported the effect of chewing disability on mortality for a 9-year observation period, but did not observe the outcome during the first 4.5 years of follow-up. In addition, oral infection in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease has been postulated to be involved at a very early stage of the disease [77]. As one cannot be sure about the true induction period, statistical methods may be used to estimate the most appropriate induction period [19]. This Methodological issue, however, has not been applied yet inthe reviewed research. Effects without appropriate allowance for the empirical induction period are underestimated[78]. Hence, it is not surprising that the reviewed studies have found, if at all, only small effects of tooth loss on mortality. The longer the supposed time sequence between the exposure and the occurrence of the outcome, the more crucial to analyse the empirical induction period. Under the assumption of an induction period of at least 5 years, sample restricted to very old populations would decrease the statistical power because very old subjects are likely to die during the next 5 years [43, 44, 48, 55] before tooth loss may have an effect on mortality. Moreover, the accumulation of risk factors over a lengthy induction time complicates to explore whether and to what extent is death a consequence of oral risk factors and to identify the underlying pathway. To avoid a long induction period,intermediate stages are recommended to be observed [19].Assessing intermediary variables, such as change in inflammatory markers or gastrointestinal symptoms, may elucidate how much of the putative effect of tooth loss on mortality is carried by each pathway.The diversity of exposures is a further limitation to interpret and compare the studies. As has been discussed in an earlier review, misclassification of the exposure statuscan yield substantially biased parameter estimates [5]. The Suppositious biological pathway should determine the exposure definition. If nutrition were assumed to be on the pathway, it would be more appropriate to use the number of unreplaced teeth as exposure of interest rather than the number of missing teeth. For nutrition as intermediate, it would be misleading to count the number of missing teeth, when subjects had the same number of missing teeth but different numbers of replaced teeth. In Contrast, if the inflammatory pathway were taken, periodontal parameters or the number of missing teeth as a surrogate for past periodontal disease may be more suitable.Thereby periodontal disease should not be mixed with categories of tooth loss in the exposure status because the corresponding confounder sets may differ.Confounding bias may further explain the inconsistent patterns of the associations between mortality and the number of teeth, albeit only few studies lacked adjustment for major confounders. Smoking has considerable influence on the development of clinically detectable periodontitis[79], which eventually over a period of time leads to tooth loss. As smoking is also an important risk factor for all-cause and circulatory mortality [80], its non-consideration or rough classification [81, 82] may have given rise to an overestimation of tooth number-related effects on mortality in some studies [39, 41, 43, 44, 50]. Residual confounding because of smoking has not always been discussed [41, 43,44, 49, 50], although it was known that the relationship between periodontal and cardiovascular disease is prone to this major limitation [83]. Similarly, not controlling diabetes, body mass index or obesity as surrogates limits the validity of some findings [41, 43, 44, 46, 49, 50, 52, 55]becausediabetesis an important risk factor of periodontal disease and strongly associated with increased mortality and thereby confounding the relationship between tooth loss and mortality [84].Studies examining circulatory mortality (Table1) might have lacked statistical power and were expected to havelower validity than studies of similar size that examined fatal events from all causes. Nevertheless, there was higher evidence for circulatory mortality compared with all-cause mortality, which could, on the other hand, be expected because circulatory diseases are linked to both major pathways. Moreover, the number of competing risk factors for circulatory mortality is smaller compared with those for all-cause mortality. Thus, putative effects of the number of teeth on circulatory mortality may be less attenuated.Denture use and all-cause mortality In view of the amount of research on the relation between tooth loss and mortality, very few [37, 38, 42, 53, 54, 58]involved prosthodontic aspects and, to the best of our knowledge, the number of unreplaced teeth has not been addressed in this relationship yet. Therefore, denture (non-)use served as a proxy for the exposure to unreplaced teething this review (Table2). Because of low- to moderate-quality studies (Table5), especially regarding confounding bias, the recommendation for a causal relationship between denture use and all-cause mortality is graded with level D.However, under the assumptions we chose for the bias analysis, an effect of denture use on all-cause mortality would be present.Albeit relying on moderate level of evidence from two studies [42, 58], findings insinuate a protective effect of prostheses on survival in the elderly, which seems to increase with decreasing number of natural teeth and is at least present for subjects who have lost any occlusal contact on natural teeth [58] or edentulous individuals[54].The same limitations as for studies on the number of teeth are present in studies on the exposure to denture use(Table5). Particularly, lack of adjustment for SES is likely to bias the relationship between denture use and mortality,since higher income and higher educational levels may reduce mortality risk and privilege to get missing teeth replaced, at least in Western countries [29]. Additionally,the number of remaining natural teeth primarily determines the type of prosthesis and chewing ability and may,therefore, be a further variable that merits adjustment, as demonstrated by Fukai et al. [42] and supported by the DOG analysis (as stated above).Misclassification of the unexposed reference category[85], as for example mixing dentate individuals who don't need dentures and individuals with missing or no teeth who do not use dentures [38], two extremely different dental status categories implying just as different chewing ability,could have made it difficult to detect a cause–effect relationship or distorted the relationship. Ill-fitting dentures may evoke denture stomatitis, allowing oral microorganisms to enter the bloodstream via mucosal lesions [60, 86],which may represent a further pathway besides nutrition in which the prosthodontic status acts. None of the studies[37, 38, 42, 54, 58, 87], however, enhanced the specificity of prosthodontic exposure definitions by quality (fixed or removable) of prostheses.The majority of study participants were old (65–79 years)or very old (≥80 years), thereby limiting generalisability of the findings for younger populations. Older individuals may have been longer exposed to tooth loss and showing advanced alveolar bone resorption to the disadvantage of denture retention and stability and even more impaired chewing function [88]. For further details, please refer to the Supplementary discussion section of the OnlineResource1 on pp 5 and 6.Conclusions and recommendations for further research Given results demonstrated by well-designed studies for circulatory mortality and the limitations of the reviewed studies for all-cause mortality, it is open whether competing risks of cause-specific death other than circulatory mortality reduce an effect of the number of teeth on all-cause mortality. An effect of denture use on circulatory mortality remains to be established, as well as how the number of replaced teeth affects mortality.Drawing on lessons learned, we offer some constructive recommendations for mortality research, which may address essential problems of the topic of this review and beyond[34].1.Hypothesise different induction periods and analyse the data under each separate hypothesis. Define Exposure variable dichotomously to allow combining the person-time of exposed subjects that is not related to the exposure (under the hypothesis of a specific induction time)with follow-up time of subjects who were never exposed.2.Draw samples of adults not older than 65 years.3.Assess change in exposure and use corresponding models with time-dependent variables.4.Define the exposure according to the hypothesized pathway (periodontal disease or number of unreplaced teeth). Avoid mixing different types of exposure variables and choose a valid definition of the unexposed reference condition.5.Assess confounders appropriately (including smoking,diabetes and income, with respect to prosthodontic replacements); avoid prediction models.6.At least for the nutrition pathway, exclude subjects with history of cancer because they are likely to have changed dietary patterns and lost teeth.Future research on the effect of tooth loss on mortality can essentially benefit from sophisticated methodological approaches. Acknowledging the aforementioned items may reduce bias in the design and analysis of epidemiological studies and substantiate the contribution of coexisting causal pathways to the exposure effect. Specifying the role of potential pathways by which tooth loss-related mortality is mediated will possibly increase the value of restorative and periodontal interventions for general health, with regard to cost-effectiveness of preventive strategies for healthy ageing as well.Acknowledgments This work is part of the Community Medicine Research net (CMR) of the University of Greifswald, Germany, which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (grantnos. 01ZZ9603, 01ZZ0103 and 01ZZ0403), the Ministry of Cultural Affairs as well as the Social Ministry of the Federal State of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania.

"Periodontal disease, but not edentulism, is independently associated with increased plasma fibrinogen levels","Christian Schwahn, Henry Völzke, Daniel M. Robinson, Jan Luedemann, Olaf Bernhardt, Dietmar Gesch, Ulrich John, Thomas Kocher","Summary The systemic response to periodontal disease was analyzed in the cross-sectional Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). The Completed data of 2,738 subjects aged 20 to 59 years were used for logistic regression analysis with an increased plasma fibrinogen level (≥3.25 g/L according to Clauss) as the dependent variable. Participants were divided into four groups according to the number of periodontal pockets ≥4mm (0, 1-7, 8-14,≥15 pocketing). An additional group comprised the 52 edentulous subjects. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of ≥15 periodontal pockets for increased plasma fibrinogen levels was1.88 (95% CI: 1.25-2.83). Edentulism per se was not associated with increased plasma fibrinogen levels but was contained in a two-way interaction with the number of cigarettes/day in current smokers (p = 0.031). For edentulous nonsmokers the adjusted OR was 1.10 (95% CI: 0.51-2.39). Furthermore, body mass index, the interaction between gender and body mass index, serum LDL cholesterol, medication, the interaction between LDL cholesterol and medication, aspirin, smoking,school education, chronic bronchitis, and the interaction between alcohol consumption and chronic gastritis were associated with plasma fibrinogen levels. Our results show that periodontal disease but not edentulism per se is associated with an increased plasma fibrinogen level. Keywords Fibrinogen, periodontal disease, Study of Health in Pomerania, SHIP","Introduction Chronic infections have recently been discussed as a risk factorfor coronary artery disease. Micro-organisms suspected of caus-ing atherosclerotic end-points include chlamydia pneumoniaeor helicobacter pylori(1, 2). Periodontal disease, another chron-ic infection caused by Gram-negative bacteria raised similiarqueries and elicited similiar controversial results. Several stud-ies have reported associations between periodontal infectionsand cardiovascular disease outcomes (3-5). However, thesefindings could not always be confirmed (6, 7). One mechanismwhich may explain the relationship between periodontal diseaseand atherosclerosis was provided by a mouse model. A long-term systemic challenge with Porphyromonas gingivalis accel-erated the progression of atherosclerotic plaques by causingincreased systemic levels of pro-inlammatory factors such asinterleukin-1and serum amyloid A (8). Epidemiological evi-dence exists, and demonstrates that inflammatory markers areindependent risk factors for coronary artery disease and acutemyocardial infarction (9-14). Particularly for population-basedstudies, the use of plasma fibrinogen levels are recommended asa marker for inflammation with regard to the risk of cardiovas-cular disease (15, 16). The characteristic patterns of change inplasma concentrations (17) suggest that fibrinogen could beeven more suitable than high-sensitivity C-reactive protein toreflect agent-host relationships. If the current status of periodontal disease, but not edentul-ism per se, is related to plasma fibrinogen level, then thehypothesis of a causal relationship between periodontal diseaseand coronary heart disease would be supported.The aim of this population-based study was to investigatethe relationship between periodontal pockets, edentulism andplasma fibrinogen levels and to detect independent risk factorsfor elevated plasma fibrinogen levels. Materials and methods The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) is a cross-sectional study in West Pomerania, a region in the northeast of Germany(18). From the total population of 212,157 living in the study area, a random sample was drawn. The sample was selected using resident registration data and performed in two steps.Firstly, the three cities of the region (with 17,076 to 65,977 inhabitants) and the twelve towns (with 1,516 to 3,044 inhabitants) were selected, and then of the smaller towns (with less than 1,500 inhabitants), 17 out of 97 were drawn at random.Secondly, from each of the selected communities, subjects were drawn at random, proportional to the population size of each community and stratified by age and gender. Only individuals with German citizenship and main residency in the study areas were included. Finally, 7,008 subjects were sampled, with 292 persons of each gender in each of the twelve five-year age strata. In order to minimize drop-outs by migration or death, subjects were selected in two waves. The net sample (without migrated or deceased persons) comprised 6,267 eligible subjects. Selected persons received a maximum of three written invitations. In cases where the person did not respond, letters were followed by a phone call or buy a home visit, if contact by phone was not possible. The final SHIP sample comprised 4,310 participants (68.8% of eligible subjects). The data collection and instruments consisted of four parts: medical examination,oral health examination, health-related interview, and health-and risk-factor-related questionnaire. Data were collected between October 1997 and May 2001. All participants gave informed written consent. The present analysis was limited to persons aged between 20 and 59 years (response 71.6%). One hundred and sixty-six subjects who had missing data for different reasons (96 subjects without low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol values, 48 subjects without plasma fibrinogen values) were excluded. This Resulted in a final study population of 2,738 subjects (1,276 men, 1,462 women) who were available for the present analysis. Plasma fibrinogen concentrations were assayed according to Class (19) using an Electra 1600 analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory, Barcelona, Spain). The laboratory reference ranges 1.7-3.2 g/L. The current status of periodontal disease was assessed by probing depth half mouth. The examination was performed by trained dentists, either on the left or right quadrants (20). All fully erupted teeth, except third molars, were assessed resulting in a maximum of 14 teeth per subject.Probing depths [mm] were examined with a periodontal probe(PCP 11, Hu-Friedy) at mesiobuccal, mid buccal, and mid lingual aspects on each selected tooth. Participants were divided into four groups according to the number of periodontal pocketing ≥4mm (0, 1-7, 8-14, ≥15 pocketing). The fifth group consisted of edentulous persons with an additional variable of its own to differentiate zero pockets due to edentulism from zero pockets due to absent periodontal disease.For the analysis, a set of potential confounder variables was selected. From the interview we included: age (continuous),gender (reference: male), current smoking (cigarettes/day; the number of cigarettes consumed daily was set at 0.5 in occasional smokers with <1 cigarettes/day), former smoking (4 categories: never (reference), <1, 1-9, ≥10 cigarettes/day), school education (3 categories: <10 years, 10 years (reference), 12 years),occupation (7 categories), household income (continuous),alcohol consumption on the last weekend (4 categories: 0 g (reference), 1-150 g, 151-300 g, >300 g), physical activity (report-ed vigorous exercise once a week or more) (yes/no), SHIP field center (2 categories), localization (urban or rural), certain chronic diseases during the past year (yes/no): gastritis, bronchitis, phlebitis, thrombosis, kidney disease, arthrosis, osteoporosis, pancreatitis, oesophagitis, thyroiditis, cancer, liver cirrhosis, and cholelithiasis. Diabetes mellitus was defined by a positive history of diabetes or hemoglobin (Hb)A1c levels >7%(yes/no). The use of any medication was documented in the interview (yes/no). In addition, the Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) code was used to assess the medication. The Following drugs were considered: vitamin-K antagonists(B01AA), heparin (B01AB), platelet aggregation inhibitors,excl. heparin (B01AC), ACE inhibitors (C09A, C09B), angiotensin-II antagonists (C09C, C09D), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (C10AA), fibrates (C10AB), oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy (G03A, G03C, G03D, G03F),systemic glucocorticoids (H02AB), antibiotics (J01), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (M01A), salicylic acid and its derivatives (N02BA). From the medical examination we selected body mass index (BMI; kg/m2), weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg). Among the laboratory serum parameters total cholesterol (mmol/L), high density lipoprotein (HDL)cholesterol (mmol/L), LDL cholesterol (mmol/L), the LDL/HDL ratio, triglycerides (mmol/L) and HbA1c (%) entered the analyses. Since diabetes is a known risk factor for periodontal disease (21, 22), diabetes was forced into the model regardless of the significance. Data on quantitative characteristics are expressed as median and interquartile range or 25th – 50th – 75th percentile (smok-ing). Data on qualitative characteristics are expressed as percent values or absolute numbers as indicated. Comparisons among groups were made using Kruskal-Wallis H-test (continuous data) and chi2-test (nominal data), pairwise comparisons were performed with Mann-Whitney’s U-test (continuous data) and chi2-test (nominal data). Persons belonging to the top quartile of the plasma fibrinogen level were defined as cases. Odds ratios(OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for this endpoint. In all, three logistic regression models were run.Firstly, the selected variables were reduced to a basic set by different selection procedures, as described elsewhere (23).Secondly, three-way and two-way interactions between the variables were assessed. Finally, the variables “periodontal pocket-ing“ and “edentulism“ were entered into the model and the interactions including the new variables were assessed once more. A value of p <0.05 was considered statistically significant with one exception, interactions were allowed to enter the model if the likelihood ratio obtained a statistical significance of p <0.10 (24). The significant three-way interactions were calculated but not listed. Several additional analyses were done foreach gender to include women-specific factors such as menopause, the use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. Analyses were also repeated for current, former and never smokers, respectively. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software, version 11.0. Results Persons with plasma fibrinogen levels of 3.25 g/L or higher belonged to the top quartile of the plasma fibrinogen distribution. Among the final sample of 2,738 individuals, 685 persons meet this criterion and were defined as cases. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics with respect to the status of increased plasma fibrinogen level. Subjects with increased plasma fibrinogen levels were older, more often of female gender, and more often smokers than subjects without elevated plasma fibrinogen concentrations. Cases were less educated, consume less alcohol, had more often from chronic bronchitis, and used medication in general more often, ACE inhibitors and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Furthermore, they exhibited a higher BMI, a higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1c, as well as a higher LDL/HDL ratio, but lower serum levels of HDL cholesterol. Females with increased plasma fibrinogen levels used oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy less often (Table 1). Among the dental variables, persons with increased plasma fibrinogen levels had periodontal pockets more often and were more often edentulous than those without (Table 1). The following variables were excluded from the logistic models due to multicollinearity or inefficiency: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (with BMI), HbA1c (with BMI and LDL cholesterol), total cholesterol and triglycerides (with LDL cholesterol), HDL cholesterol (with LDL cholesterol and BMI). Age,gender, smoking status, school education, chronic bronchitis and gastritis, alcohol consumption, diabetes, antidiabetic and general medication, ATC code N02BA, BMI and LDL cholesterol were included in the 1st logistic regression model. The Remaining variables did not attain statistical significance.Detailed analyses of the final model showed no relevant problems of multicollinearity.The results of the logistic regression model with two-way interactions are given in Table 2. As hypothesized, periodontal disease was independently associated with increased plasma fibrinogen levels, which were higher in individuals with ≥15 periodontal pocketing compared to individuals without pockets.The number of periodontal pockets was not contained in any of the interactions tested. Edentulism per se did not independently predict increased plasma fibrinogen levels. However, edentulism interacted with smoking. The effect of smoking on plasma fibrinogen concentrations was stronger in edentulous than in dentate subjects; theORY for the smoking status was higher and increased more rapidly in edentulous persons (OR for 0; 5; 10; 15 cigarettes/day 1.10; 2.08; 3.93; 7.41) than in dentate subjects (OR for 0; 5; 10;15 cigarettes/day 1.00; 1.23; 1.51; 1.85). Furthermore, there was a three-way interaction between edentulism, smoking and the use of any medication (p = 0.001). The rapidly increasing effect on plasma fibrinogen levels due to the number of cigarettes/day was only observed in edentulous subjects without medication (Fig. 1).Interactions of periodontal pocketing with other variables were not found. An interaction between smoking and periodontal pocketing was not detected despite the use of different categorical variables or continuous variables for current smoking habits. Also, former smoking did not interact with periodontal disease in an additional analysis. Analyses among healthy, never smokers were recommended to improve the confounding (25).For persons who never smoked and were without medication (n = 321), the OR was 7.85 (p = 0.004) for ≥15 periodontal pocketing.Further results of the logistic regression merit consideration.Current chronic bronchitis was independently related with increased plasma fibrinogen levels. Data also obtained a tendency towards a U-shaped relationship between alcohol drinking and plasma fibrinogen levels. Alcohol consumption up to 300 gon the previous weekend had protective effects against plasma fibrinogen levels compared to no alcohol drinking during the previous weekend. Furthermore, alcohol drinking interacted with chronic gastritis on the investigated end-point (p = 0.001;Fig. 2). Compared to subjects without gastritis and no alcohol-use on the previous weekend, the OR in subjects without chronic gastritis were 0.60 (1-150 g alcohol) and 0.32 (151-300 galcohol) whereas the OR in subjects with chronic gastritis were 0.29 (1-150 g alcohol) and 1.89 (151-300 g alcohol), respectively. A high educational level and the use of aspirin were inversely associated with elevated plasma fibrinogen levels.The analysis revealed two further interactions. Firstly, the use of any medication modified the dependence of plasma fibrinogen concentrations on the serum LDL cholesterol concentrations (Table 2). Secondly, an interaction between BMI and gender was found. For the illustration of this interaction, the observed BMI values were cut using the median (26.1 kg/m2;Fig. 3). The effects of BMI on plasma fibrinogen concentrations were stronger in women than in men.The logistic regression models were re-analyzed with different variations of the variable age (categorized and continuous,age2) in order to control for this confounding. These analyses yielded similar results with respect to the hypothesized association; periodontal pocketing remained an independent risk factor for elevated plasma fibrinogen concentrations in all of these models.The analysis was also repeated ignoring problems of multicollinearity or inefficiency by including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and HbA1c. The OR for ≥15 pockets was slightly altered to1.881 (p = 0.003 for this category, p = 0.027 over all periodontal categories). The numerical value of the 75% percentile in our sample which we used as the cut-off point was 3.25 g/L. This value corresponds with the upper limit of the reference range for plasma fibrinogen concentration according to Clauss which is given by the method used in the present analysis (1.7-3.2 g/L). Only six persons (0.22%) had values >3.20 g/L and <3.25 g/L. To check for sensitivity of our results with respect to the choice of cut-off point, we repeated the analysis using the upper value of the laboratory reference range instead of the 75% percentile. The Results of the logistic regression analyses were similar with respect to the association between the dental variables and increased plasma fibrinogen levels.Discussion The present study provides evidence for an independent relationship between the number of periodontal pockets and plasma fibrinogen level. Additionally, a relationship between edentulism and plasma fibrinogen concentration in the interaction with smoking was found. Edentulism per se was not associated with plasma fibrinogen level. These findings further elucidate the biological relationship between periodontal disease and the risk of cardiovascular disease.The systemic response to periodontal disease has previously been analyzed in two population-based studies (26, 27). Wu Et al. (26) found an association between subgingival calculus and elevated plasma fibrinogen levels in the data derived from the cross-sectional NHANES III study. Another report from this study (27) demonstrated moderately elevated plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein in individuals with periodontal pocketing as well as in edentulous individuals. Some limitations of both studies (26, 27) merit consideration. The sample analyzed by Wu et al. (26) was restricted to individuals who had at least six teeth and was therefore biased by selection. The analyses of Slade et al. (27) did not differentiate between younger and older people with respect to edentulism. Edentulism could be regarded as usual in the sense that the prevalence of edentulism in older people is high, whereas for younger people edentulism tends to be unusual (prevalence ≤15% in the age group). InSHIP, edentulism is unusual in individuals less than 60 years of age (prevalence ≤15% in all five-year age groups). Because of the age restriction in our analysis, a previous severe oral diseases can be assumed in those affected persons. To take into consideration the biological concept of the agent-host-environment (28),it is important to differentiate between usual and unusual tooth loss. The failure to do so could explain for the association of edentulism per se with increased C-reactive protein levels in NHANES III (27). By restricting the age and modelling the interaction between edentulism and smoking, our results concerning the investigated relationship between increased levels of fibrinogen and edentulism are sound. The restriction of the analysis to younger individuals in our study has one further advantage. The association between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease was reported to be stronger in younger age groups than in the elderly (29, 30). It can be assumed that persons who had increased plasma fibrinogen levels according to our definition (≥3.25 g/L) would exhibit an increased risk for atherosclerosis (13).In the present study, the current status of periodontal disease was defined by probing depth. The definition of periodontal disease by measuring the percentage of periodontal pockets, as performed in other studies (27), may be problematic; the number of periodontal pockets may decrease with the number of teeth, especially in older persons, whereas the percentage remains constant. Furthermore, BMI, an important confounder for the relationship between periodontal disease and systemic inflammation, was not considered in one analysis (27).Despite various efforts being made, an interaction between periodontal disease and smoking status on the endpoint could not be identified. This confirms the findings of Slade et al. (27).Smoking is one of the most important causes for increased markers of inflammation (13) and is also a major risk factor for periodontitis (21). An attenuation of the effect of smoking on plasma fibrinogen levels was expected by including periodontal pocketing, but the confounding effect was remarkably low(from OR = 1.25; 1.57 and 1.96 to OR = 1.23; 1.51; 1.85 for 5;10 and 15 cigarettes per day, respectively). The role of smoking on plasma fibrinogen levels is also reflected by the association between chronic bronchitis and plasma fibrinogen concentration which was present in our analysis. This is in agreement with other studies (31, 32). The possible reduction of cardiovascular risk by treating chronic bronchitis with certain antibiotic regimens is currently under debate (33-35). For patients with coronary artery disease the beneficial effect of macrolide treatment in addition to standard therapy seems to be very small(36). However, these findings need to be confirmed on a population-based level. In concordance with other reports (13, 37-43) a number of factors were associated with increased plasma fibrinogen levels arguing for the good validity of our study. These factors include abstinence from alcoholic beverages (38, 41, 44), chronic gastritis (33), poor education level (13) and higher LDL cholesterol levels (13). The interaction between BMI and gender may not be a contradiction to the observation that fibrinogen levels are consistently found to be higher in women than in men (42). The Interactions between smoking and hypertension or diabetes formales, or smoking and LDL/HDL-ratio for females (42), were masked by the interaction between medication and LDL (analysis divided by gender) or were not significant in the present analysis. The interaction between medication and LDL may be explained as an effect of unknown diseases or low compliance.In agreement with other studies (45) the use of aspirin was inversely related to plasma fibrinogen levels in the present study. In contrast to former studies (13), age was not independently associated with plasma fibrinogen levels. However, significant effects of age on plasma fibrinogen concentrations were detected if school education, LDL cholesterol, BMI or periodontal pocketing were rejected from the logistic regression model. Indeed, the confounding effect of periodontal disease on the association between age and plasma fibrinogen level is plausible as the number of periodontal pocketing increases with age before 40 years (Fig. 4). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which could demonstrate that edentulism per se is not associated with plasma fibrinogen levels. An association was only observed in smokers. In conclusion, there is an independent association between periodontal disease and plasma fibrinogen levels. These findings further explain the relationship between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease.",-,"1. Kiehl's, Egger G, Mayr M, et al.

Association Between Edentulism and Angina Pectoris in Mexican Adults Aged 35 Years and Older: A Multivariate Analysis of a Population-Based Survey,"Carlo Eduardo Medina-Solı ́s,*†Ame ́rica Patricia Pontigo-Loyola,* Eduardo Pe ́rez-Campos,†‡Pedro Hernan ́ndez-Cruz,†‡Leticia A ́vila-Burgos,§Michael J. Kowolik,iand Gerardo Maupome ́i","Background:The possible association between oral infection and chronic inflammation and cardiovascular disease risk has been studied intensively.The present study is designed to determine the strength of association between edentulism and angina pectoris in Mexican adults aged 35 years and older.Methods:Using the tools and sampling strategies of the World Health Survey of the World Health Organization, cross-sectional data were collected in Mexico in the National Performance Assessment Survey (probabilistic, multistage, and cluster sampling). Dental information was available for 20 of the 32 states of Mexico. Angina and edentulism areself-reported in this study. Statistical analysis was performed using binary logistic regression adjusting for complex samples.Results:A total of 13,966 participants, representing a population of 29,853,607 individuals, were included. Of the complete study population,3,052,263 (10.2%) were completely toothless, and 673,810 (2.3%) were diagnosed with angina pectoris. After adjusting for smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, body mass index, and sex, the effect of edentulism on angina was modified by age (interaction), being more marked in the younger age group (odds ratio [OR]=exp2.5597=12.93) than in the older individuals surveyed (OR=exp2.5597+(-0.0334)=12.51). Additionally, low physical activity (OR=1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.03 to 2.22)and higher socioeconomic status (OR=1.37; 95% CI=1.00 to 1.90) were more likely to be associated with angina pectoris.Conclusions:Overall, the results of this study, conducted in a representative sample of Mexican adults, suggest that an association exists between edentulism and angina pectoris. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanism for this association.J Periodontol 2014;85:406-416.KEY WORDS Angina pectoris; cardiovascular diseases; edentulous, mouth; oral health;periodontal diseases; tooth loss.","Dental caries and periodontitis are diseases intimately associated with bacteria and affect the hardan supporting tissues of teeth, respectively. If These chronic diseases are not controlled, they have the potential to cause tooth loss. Globally,they represent important oral health problems because of their elevated prevalence and incidence in populations with severe socioeconomic disadvantage. In terms of pain, suffering, diminished function, and impact on quality of life,the morbidity is considerable and costly.1 Adult dental caries and periodontal disease, in terms of global prevalence, have been designated the first and sixth most debilitating conditions.2 In addition, oral infections may have a negative impact at the systemic level.3-13 Given That cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main cause of death globally,considerable attention has been devoted to investigating the hypothesis that the nearly ubiquitous oral cavity infections are associated with CVD risk and cardiac disease.7-13 Around the world, individuals may lose their natural teeth until complete toothlessness (edentulism);dental caries or periodontal disease are often implicated.14-17 In Mexico, these are the two main reasons for tooth extractions in the adult population.18 Both diseases may lead to chronic infection that can trigger systemic inflammatory mechanisms. Chronic inflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, which is involved in the initiation, progression,and final stages of infarction; thus, circulating inflammatory biomarkers have been consistently associated with a greater risk of CVD.19 Factors Associated with chronic inflammation and oral infections have been studied in an attempt to explain the relationship between oral diseases and CVDs.Oral infections are associated with a moderate systemic inflammatory response, such as elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein and other inflammatory biomarkers.20-23 Angina pectoris is the main manifestation of symptomatic myocardial ischemia and is generally associated with coronary artery disease leading to insufficient blood reaching the heart. Although Stable angina is a common initial presentation of coronary disease, and it greatly affects quality of life, work capacity, and costs to society, only a few large-scale epidemiologic studies have been undertaken to identify risk factors for angina pectoris.24 Some of those factors include the following: 1)antioxidant deficiencies; 2) aging; 3) obesity; 4)high cholesterol; 5) insulin resistance; 6) glycemic index; 7) inflammation; 8) stress; and 9) hypertension.25,26 Concerning the oral health status as an indicator of angina pectoris risk, Paunio et al.27 observed that ischemic heart disease (angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction) was associated with tooth loss experience, in addition to age, clinical diagnosis of arterial hypertension,geographical area, and education level. Likewise,Frisk et al.28 explored the possible association between endodontic disease and coronary disease,specifically angina pectoris and a history of myocardial infarction. In their study, dental variables associated with infection included the following: 1)the number of teeth with root fillings; 2) number of teeth with periapical radiolucency; and 3) tooth loss. In the multivariate analysis of these factors,only tooth loss was positively associated with coronary disease and therefore presumably not necessarily associated with endodontic causes.Alternatively, using data from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort Study, Ylo ̈stalo et al.29foundan association among self-reported gingivitis,dental caries, and tooth loss and the presence of angina pectoris. In the United States, Dietrich Et al.12 found that edentulous males aged 60 years and older tended to have greater risk of coronary disease than dentate males, independent of other variables. Bohlin et al.30 studied the association of several periodontal clinical indicators and coronary disease in Finnish individuals, observing that losing weight to 17 teeth was associated with stable coronary disease and acute coronary syndrome. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES) data, Fedele et al.31 found that individuals with oral mucosal disease were 1.36times (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.02 to 1.80)more likely to have a history of myocardial infarction and 1.33 times (95% CI=1.03 to 1.71)more likely to report angina than unaffected individuals. All associations were independent of common confounding factors. Arbres et al.32 used similar variables and found that, after adjusting forage, sex, race, poverty, smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and serum cholesterol, the odds of heart attack increased with more severe attachment loss (AL). Lu et al.33 examined the relationship between AL and peripheral vascular disease using 1999 to 2002 NHANES data. After adjusting for age, sex, race,poverty, traditional risk factors of peripheral vascular disease, and other potential confounding factors, periodontal AL was significantly associated with peripheral vascular disease. Finally, Watt Et al.34 used data from the Scottish Health Survey To confirm an association between edentulism and death because of cardiovascular conditions:edentate individuals had 2.97 times (95% CI=1.46, 6.05) higher risk for stroke-related mortality.To expand the body of evidence that associates tooth loss with CVD beyond the existing literature primarily limited to industrialized countries, the objective of the present study is to quantify the association between edentulism and angina pectoris (both conditions self-reported) in Mexican Adults who were aged 35 years and older.MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Design, Population, and Sample The Mexican National Performance Evaluation Survey (NPES) from 2002 to 2003 was part of the technical collaboration between the Ministry of Health of Mexico and the World Health Organization(WHO), following the survey instrument and sam-pling strategies developed by WHO for the World Health Survey. The methodology of the NPES and some results of the oral health section have been published previously.35,36The National Institute of Public Health and the Ministry of Health General Directorate of Performance Evaluation implemented the survey. The instruments were translated and adapted to the Mexican environment. NPES pro-vides policymakers with reliable and internationallycomparable baseline information on a variety of health indicators, including general population health measures and the effectiveness of health systems. NPES included in the data collected coverage of dental health services and edentulism.The NPES was conducted from November 2002 to April 2003. The response rate was 96.4%, and collected information from 38,746 households in the 32 states in the country, with a mean of 1,211 households per state. However, only 20 states collected dental data (stage II of the survey). NPPES data on dental conditions are thus available for individuals aged‡18 years, representing a total of 24,159 households. The sample design wasprobabilistic, multistaged, stratified, and throughconglomerates and was calculated to provide rep-resentative information at the state level and byurban and rural areas. Three strata were consid-ered: 1) cities or metropolitan areas (locationswith>100,000 inhabitants); 2) urban settings(locations from 2,500 to 99,999 inhabitants); and3) rural areas (locations with<2,500 inhabi-tants). In this analysis, individuals younger than 35years (to maintain consistency with the populationgroup at risk for angina pectoris) were eliminated,so that the final sample comprised 13,966 par-ticipants.Variables Included and Data GatheringThe survey was organized into two different ques-tionnaires, with one questionnaire focusing onhousehold conditions and the other inquiring aboutpersonal factors. In the first questionnaire, in-formation was gathered regarding the following: 1)residential services; 2) income; 3) expenses; and 4)health insurance. The individual questionnairegathered different information including the follow-ing: 1) health status; 2) risk factors; 3) prevalence ofcertain diseases; 4) use of health services; 5) re-sponse capacity of the system to address non-medical expectations of the population; and 6)coverage of certain interventions. The length of thesequestionnaires required an interview time of110minutes per household.Response variable: Angina pectoris.For the cal-culation of prevalence of angina, the followingquestion was formulated (question Q6009): ‘‘Haveyou ever been told by your doctor or any other healthprofessional that you have been diagnosed withangina pectoris (heart disease)’’? This was the de-pendent variable.Independent variables.The main independentvariable was edentulism, which refers to the ab-sence of all natural teeth in the mouth (gatheredthrough question Q6757): ‘‘Have you lost all of yournatural teeth?’’ In addition, a series of known risk factors for angina and sociodemographic and so-cioeconomic variables were included: 1) age (35 to98 years); 2) sex (male or female); 3) physical activity (high activity or low activity); 4) BMI(malnutrition, normal, overweight, or obesity); 5)diabetes (no or yes); 6) tobacco use (never/not currently, sometimes, or daily); 7) health insurance(insured or non-insured); 8) education level (less than elementary school, completed elementary school, completed secondary school, high school or equivalent, or college or higher education); 9) occupation (employed in the public sector, employed outside the public sector, self-employed, or not working or doing volunteer work);10)residence(rural or urban); and 11) socioeconomic status (SES).Statistical Analyses And analysis of main components using polychoric correlation generated the variables measuring SES(household characteristics from the house, the building materials of the walls and floor, the number of rooms in the house, the characteristics of bathroom and kitchen, the source of water, having electricity and heating, and an estimate of household overcrowding) and physical activity (moderate and intense).37The new variable generated forCES was categorized into quintiles. The variable of physical activity was divided, with the media being the cutting point. There were some ‘‘missing’’ data for the weight variables (n=243), size(n=367), insurance (n=30), and SES (n=1).The missing data were imputed according to the missing data analysis method known as ‘‘regression imputation.’’38 All of the data presented here are weighted data.First, a univariate analysis was performed, reporting the summary measures according to each case for the nominal and ordinal variables (frequency and percentages) and the continuous variables (measures of central tendency and dispersion). Given That the angina variable was a dichotomous variable(0 without diagnosis of angina and 1 with diagnosis of angina), a binary logistic regression analysis was used for the bivariate and multivariate analyses.The variance inflation factor was used to analyze and avoid multicollinearity between the independent variables. Variables with a statistical significance of P<0.25 in the bivariate analysis were included in the final model. Subsequently, the P values were calculated, and the odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with a 95% CI.39,40 Because of the design used in the survey sampling,a module for complex samples of a statistical package was used for the statistical analysis.#RESULTSIn total, data from 13,966 participants representing population of 29,853,607 individuals were included. The descriptive results are shown in Table 1.The average age was 50.95–12.98 years. Females Represented 57.9% of the sample. In total, 10.2% of the participants were edentulous, and 2.3% hada diagnosis of angina pectoris.Table 1 also shows that the majority of individuals had low levels of physical activity(68.1%). Individuals who represented the greatest percentage were overweight or obese (42.1% and 19.7%, respectively). Of those interviewed, 8.4%reported having diabetes (presumably type 2). A High percentage of participants (77.3%) reported no current smoking. A small percentage (38.9%) reported having some type of health insurance. Only A minority had completed high school or college(9.1% and 6.2%, respectively). Approximately half of those surveyed (47.3%) had some type of job.The majority of participants (73.3%) had their place of residence in an urban area.Table 2 shows the results of the bivariate analysis and the prevalence of angina pectoris throughout the categories of independent variables. It was observed that the significant variables (P<0.05)were age, edentulism, physical activity, health insurance, and SES. However, to ameliorate the possibility of confounding in the final model, BMI,diabetes, tobacco use, education, and occupation variables were incorporated (P Value was<0.25 in some of these). In Table 3, the distribution of edentulism and angina by age and sex are presented.The multivariate logistic regression model identified four principal effects and one interaction(Table 4). Individuals with low physical activity hada 51% (95% CI=1.03 to 2.22) greater possibility of having a diagnosis of angina pectoris than those who had higher physical activity. Those with higher SES had greater likelihood (OR=1.37;95% CI=1.00 to 1.90) of having angina pectoris than those with a lower SES. The effect of edentulism on angina was moderated by age:specifically, if 1) the effect of edentulism on aginais considered to be constant at 35 years of age(OR=exp2.5597=12.93), and 2) the effect of edentulism for each year in age increased (OR=exp2.5,597+(-0.0334)=12.51) until an OR equal to 1.57 (95% CI=1.03 to 2.38) in participants aged 98 years (upper age threshold for survey respondents) was reached. Briefly, the effect of edentulism on angina was greater in younger adults than in older adults.DISCUSSION The present study aims to identify a possible association between angina pectoris and edentulism using data from a nationwide survey, which, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, is the first study of its kind ever conducted in Mexico and probably in any setting other than industrialized countries. The Mexican NPES was a probabilistic survey that allowed for the calculation of estimators in 20 Mexican states—the majority of the population and territory of the country. This implies that the results obtained by the survey are representative and maybe generalized to the population of these states and could therefore allow a nationwide epidemiologic profile of the relationship under scrutiny. Results Demonstrated the existence of a significant and positive association between angina pectoris and edentulism, even after adjusting for some known risk factors for coronary heart disease, such as alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and BMI.Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory response to bacterial plaque in which the bone and soft tissue supporting the teeth are destroyed, leading tomobility and tooth loss. Dental caries results from bacterial propagation from the dentin to the dental pulp and possibly to the periapical osseous tissues.41 The possible mechanisms through which oral infections are associated with CVDs include bacterial involvement of the arteries, specific atherogenic properties of oral bacteria, acute-phase response, and the stimulation of proinflammatory signaling cascades, including those associated with specific cytokine polymorphisms. The precise mechanism or mechanisms accounting for this relationship are uncertain. Different causal and non-causal pathways have been proposed to explain the association between coronary disease and periodontitis and other chronic oral infections.42 Causal pathways may have direct and indirect effects on the periodontal infections, whereas the genetic factors of the host and other factors that increase susceptibility to atherosclerosis/thrombosis and periodontitis would represent a non-causal alternative pathway. Conversely, edentulism could have alternative causality; for example, in terms of nutritional status, edentulous individuals may not obtain the same nutrients as dentate persons.12In this study, it is observed that edentulism was associated with the odds of having angina pectoris, and such a relationship was modified by age.These results are consistent with the findings of several authors, including Paunio et al.,27Ylo ̈staloet al.,29 and Bohlin et al.30 in Finland; Frisk et al.28in Sweden; Watt et al.34in Scotland; and Arbeset al.,32 Lu et al.,33 Fedele et al.,31 and Dietrich Et al.12 in the United States. However, a study conducted in Iceland by Ragnarsson et al.41 did not find any relationship between tooth loss/edentulism and mortality by coronary disease when the tobacco-use model was added. When adjusted for variables such as age and sex, only edentulism remained statistically significant. An interaction was observed between edentulism and age, with a gradual effect. Atherosclerotic vascular disease,whether peripheral vascular, cardiovascular, cerebral, was strongly correlated with aging. Although there are multiple risk factors involved in addition to aging, age is the most important coronary risk factor and one that cannot be corrected.43th Us, aging is progressively more important as an independent risk factor for the development of CVDs, such as atherosclerosis,hypertension, and its complications. It is well known that vascular disease develops in the later decades of life with progressive cellular and extracellular material accumulation, as well as many chronic inflammatory processes. Metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes are conventionally recognized as risk factors for developing coronary vascular disease. These conditions accelerate the aging process in general and vascular aging in particular. Vascular aging is characterized by an endothelial transition from an anti-atheroscleroticstate to a proatherosclerotic state. During normal arterial hardening associated with aging, atherosclerosis occurs not only as a result of the loss of elastin and increased presence of collagen but also as a result of qualitative changes in the vascular wall contents, in association with alterations in vasodilation in the endothelium.44 Therefore, more cases of coronary disease are observed in older adults than in young individuals.Physical activity is a necessary component to maintaining good cardiovascular health. During thepast half century, epidemiologic and clinical studieshave clearly demonstrated significant health bene-fits associated with regular physical activity; forexample, a sedentary lifestyle contributes30%increased risk for ischemic disease, such that therisk of developing CVD increases1.5 times amongthose who do not follow the minimal physical ac-tivity recommendations.45Such risk significantlydecreases with appropriate lifestyle modifications,such as increased physical activity, although thereare reasons to believe that increased high-densitylipoprotein and lower low-density lipoprotein mayhave indirect effects. Another link is a direct re-lationship among physical activity, BMI, bloodpressure, and CVD, which have led the AmericanCollege of Cardiology and the American HeartAssociation to recommend at least 30 minutes ofexercise almost every day to reduce the risk ofcardiovascular events.46However, a decreased riskof having a cardiovascular event cannot be com-pletely explained by the traditional factors. This istrue not only in healthy individuals without un-derlying risk factors but also in older individualsand those with cardiovascular risk factors.47In amanner consistent with the results of these studies,the findings show a clear inverse association be-tween angina pectoris and moderate/intense physi-cal activity.SES disparities have been established in manyaspects related to health. There is ample evidence suggesting that the position within the social structure is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality,which also occurs with respect to dental health.48-53 In addition, the existence of a correlation between health and social status is accepted; in general, individuals of a higher SES are healthier.54 Multiple Studies have shown that, in European countries and the United States, persons from a lower SES have higher rates of CVD mortality and morbidity.55,56 However, the present study found that those with higher SES had greater odds of presenting with angina pectoris. Many possible explanations may account for this seemingly paradoxical finding; for example, differential age composition across SES levels or varying life expectancies for those Mexicans Who actually reach the ages in which the onset of angina pectoris could be presenting. Additionally, it may be that features of the diet among wealthier aMericans may have aspects that are specifically negative for cardiovascular health (for example,higher saturated fat content and fewer vegetables), in association or not with more sedentary lifestyles.These aspects remain to be addressed in separate studies. Evidence from India showed that some biologic cardiovascular risk factors were worse in higher SES participants, whereas some behavioral risk factors were worse in lower SES participants.57 Another study in a young cohort of rural and urban South Indians found that higher SES was associated with a more adverse CVD risk factor profile butlower tobacco use.58It is speculated that such findings lend credence to the idea that the distribution of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries may be somewhat different from the distribution in emerging economies, however poorly defined as of today.Of course, it is indeed reasonable to consider that the association between angina and edentulism would merely be a function of comorbidity attrib-utable to common risk factors. The possible link may involve direct and indirect effects of the periodontal infection; an alternative pathway may be related to genetic factors and other host factors that could increase the susceptibility to both atherosclerosis/thrombosis and chronic periodontitis.Studies have shown that periodontitis results in higher systemic levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and neutrophils. These elevated inflammatory factors may increase inflammatory activity in atherosclerotic lesions, potentially increasing the risk for cardiac or cerebrovascular events.59 Although a direct correlation between periodontal disease and coronary artery disease appears likely,the long-term cumulative effects of periodontal disease (perhaps leading to complete edentulism)on coronary artery disease is speculative at this time.60 Of unknown importance is the fact that people rarely lose teeth without the intervention of dental practitioners, and thus access to care, and access to what kind of care, add even greater uncertainty to defining all the factors at play between increased pathophysiologic challenges and the outcome of complete edentulism.The data used in the present study are derived from a survey with national representation and rigorous design. However, as with other epidemiologic studies, this study has limitations that must be taken into account to adequately interpret the results. With respect to the design, cross-sectional studies may be affected by the shortcoming of attempting to simultaneously measure cause and effect (temporal ambiguity). For this reason, causal relationships cannot be established as in traditional cohort studies but rather only associations. With Respect to the manner in which variables were measured, the present study has the limitation that clinical confirmatory examinations were not conducted, which otherwise would provide a definitive diagnosis of angina pectoris and edentulism. It is possible that a certain type of bias could have been introduced on erroneously classifying exposure andthe result. However, tools previously validated by the WHO in the World Health Survey were used, asin the majority of countries around the world, tomake valid and reliable comparisons.61 Another Limitation is that other, well-established angina risk factors were not included that could not be adjusted for in the relevant models. In the case of tobacco use, this variable was limited to the values collected per the national survey instead of a more detailed history of tobacco use. Finally, edentulism is a condition that reflects past oral health history(for both caries and periodontal disease and including a battery of related clinical decisions) in adult populations; therefore, it has inherent limitations, especially when interpreting it in relation to cardiovascular outcomes.CONCLUSIONS The results of the present study support the existence of a link between edentulism and angina pectoris,modified by age, in a representative sample of Mexican adults. Resorting to simple self-reports of health indicators appears to be a useful approach for large-scale population studies. Given the high prevalence of oral infections in the population, it is possible that these conditions represent a substantial inflammatory burden. Given this scenario and taking into account the overall benefits of maintaining good hygiene and oral health, it appears necessary to promote health behaviors that support good oral health, independently of the potential relationship between oral and systemic diseases. It is necessary to establish, through future studies, the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms of the association that is confirmed here.ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors report no conflicts of interest related to this study.",-,"1.

A Cohort Study of the Impact of Tooth Loss and Periodontal Disease on Respiratory Events among COPD Subjects: Modulatory Role of Systemic Biomarkers of Inflammation,"Silvana P. Barros, Robert Suruki, Zvi G. Loewy, James D. Beck, Steven Offenbacher","Background: In COPD patients, fatal and non-fatal respiratory-related events are influenced by age, severity of respiratory disease, and comorbidities.Objectives:Analyze the effects of edentulism, periodontal disease and systemic biomarkers of inflammation on the occurrence of serious fatal and non-fatal respiratory-related events among subjects with COPD.Methods:Cases were identified from Dental Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Edentulism was defined as study participants without any natural teeth or implants. Participants with one or more natural teeth (comprising 11,378 subjects)were studied as dentate subjects. Periodontal disease status among dentate individuals was determined using the consensus definitions published by the joint Center for Disease Control/American Association of Periodontology working group). Adjusted Hazard Models are developed to evaluate the relationship between edentulism/periodontal disease and COPD Related Events. Models were then stratified by GOLD Stage I, II and III/IV. Serum biomarkers were also evaluated to explore the effect of systemic inflammation.Results:A statistically significant association was found between oral health status and COPD-related events, even adjusting for conditions such as hypertension, smoking and diabetes. Edentulous individuals who had been diagnosed with COPD had a higher incidence and were at greater risk of having a COPD related event (hospitalization and death) than individuals who had teeth and whose mouths had healthy periodontal status. However, being edentulous did not convey excess risk for COPD-related events for those study participants who were classified as GOLD III/IV at baseline. Finally, we showed that individuals who had levels of serum IL-6 in the highest two quartiles were at even higher risk for COPD-related events.Conclusions:These findings suggest that the risk for COPD-related events after adjusting for potential confounders may be attributable to both edentulism and elevated serum IL-6 levels.","Introduction Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) including chronic respiratory diseases, together with diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases, are the leading cause of disease burden and mortality in the world. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide and the third leading cause of death in the United States, affecting as many as 24 million Americans and resulting in 700,000 hospital admissions, and 124,000 deaths annually [1]. COPD, which is considered the major respiratory NCD with a 10.1% prevalence of stage II or higher COPD has been associated with low-grade systemic inflammation [2,3]. Thus, although COPD is primarily characterized by airflow limitation that is generally associated with an abnormal inflammatory response in the lungs, it is also often associated with a significant systemic inflammatory response which has been correlated with adverse clinical effects [4].The link between oral infection and various respiratory diseases in the dentate population has been the focus of several studies[5,6], more recently, Preshaw et al [7] presented a review focused on the association of oral and systemic health as it relates to health-related quality of life . Data from our research group demonstrated a significant association between prior COPD and edentulism [8] . This Observation correlates well with a study that resulted in the identification of diverse microbes, including respiratory pathogens on the surfaces of dentures [9].In addition to its association with an inflammatory response of the lung, COPD is also associated with systemic inflammation,including systemic oxidative stress, activation of circulating inflammatory cells and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines[9]. Levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein(CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and sICAM-1 have been reported to be elevated in COPD [10,11,12]. By improving our understanding of this association with the potential for reducing the incidence of COPD through treatment of periodontal diseases, which would have important public health and clinical implications, in the present study we focused on analyzing the effects of edentulism,periodontal disease and systemic biomarkers of inflammation on the occurrence of serious fatal and non-fatal respiratory-related events among subjects with COPD. The study population was that of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study [13].Methods Study Population The ARIC study included 15,792 individuals aged 45 to 64 years selected from four U.S. communities. This prospective cohort study has been previously described in greater detail. (TheARIC Investigators, 1989). For the current study, data from individuals participating in the Dental Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (D-ARIC) study were also used to examine the associations between edentulism, periodontal disease, and systemic biomarkers of inflammation, and the risk of serious fatal and nonfatal COPD-related events. The D-ARIC was a cross-sectional investigation conducted in a subset of dentate participants at Visit4 (1996–1998). Eligible participants were all aged 45–64 at study entry (i.e., Visit 1) and had spirometry measurements at Visit 2 (3 years later) and periodontal examinations at D-ARIC Visit 4 (6 years from visit 2). Edentulous individuals at Visit 4 were also eligible for inclusion. Lastly, all individuals were required to have at least 1 year of follow-up subsequent to Visit 4.COPD Definition Based on spirometry measurements obtained at Visit 2,individuals were considered to have COPD if they had a ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) less than 0.7. Subsequently, individuals with COPD were further categorized by disease severity, using the spirometry-based criteria for severity outlined in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guide-lines (Table 1). (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), 2007).COPD-Related Event The primary endpoint for this study was the occurrence of COPD-related events (e.g., hospitalization for COPD exacerbation) or COPD-related death during the 5-year period following Visit 4. In order to be considered related to COPD, hospitalization was required to have an ICD 9 code for COPD(491.xx, 492.x, or 496.x) entered in the discharge notes. Similarly,a death was considered COPD-related if any of the above listed ICD 9 codes were included as a primary cause, secondary cause underlying cause.Edentulism and Periodontal Disease Edentulism cases were defined as study participants without any natural teeth or implants. Participants with one or more natural teeth (comprising 11,378 subjects) were selected as dentate subjects. Periodontal disease status among dentate individuals was determined using the consensus definitions published by the joint Center for Disease Control/American Association of Periodontology/(CDC/AAP) working group. Periodontal disease severity was determined based on clinical attachment level (CAL)and probing depth (PD) according to the criteria described in Table 2.Systemic Immune Mediators Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) concentrations from once thawed serum aliquots (frozen at280C from collection until December, 2009) were all measured by ELISA techniques.Spectrophotometric endpoints were determined on a SpectraMax M2 plate reader (Molecular Probes, Sunnyvale, CA) using reagent assay kits from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The Softmax(v.5.0.1) control software package was used to fit the standard curve data using either 4-PLY or 5-PL fitting algorithms to provide a best fit of the seven-point (duplicate) standard curve after subtraction of themean reagent blank values from all measured optical densities.Standard curve concentrations ranged from 0.156–10 pg/ml for serum IL-6, 780–50,000 pg/ml for CRP, and 1,560–50,000 pg/ml for sICAM-1. Subsequently, the immune mediator concentrations were computed by application of the standard curve fitting equation.Other Covariates Participants of this study were additionally characterized with respect to research center (Jackson, Mississippi; North Carolina;Washington; Minnesota), race (African American, Caucasian),age, sex, and body mass index. History of diabetes and hypertension were also included in the analysis, as well as income and education as measures of socioeconomic status. Self-reported smoking data (both cigarettes and cigars) collected at Visit 4 was examined as a categorical variable (e.g., current, former, andnever). Additionally, pack-years of smoking were calculated for current and former smokers.Statistical Analysis Patient characteristics were compared between those with and without a COPD related event using chi-squared tests and t-test for categorical variables and continuous variables, respectively.Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for each periodontal disease and edentulous status patient group to examine the time to COPD related event; differences between Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute hazards ratios (HR) and 95%confidence intervals for COPD-related events. In addition to the crude model, a minimally adjusted and a fully adjusted model were also specified; covariates were selected for inclusion into the model a priori or based on bivariate analyses. To measure modification due to COPD severity, the above models were also stratified by COPD GOLD Stage (I, II, III/IV). All analyses were performed using the SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc,Cary, NC). A two-sided P value of,0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of edentulism (total loss of teeth), periodontal disease and systemic biomarkers of inflammation on COPD events in a cohort population with spirometry-identified COPD. The participant flow diagram with explanations for inclusion and exclusion appears in Figure 1. Among the 15,792 ARIC participants there were a total of 1635 subjects with GOLD stage I,II or III/IV COPD with known dentate status (with or without teeth) and full-mouth periodontal examination data for those with teeth. There Were a total of 440 edentulous subjects and 1195 dentate subjects who were followed for events over a 5 year period with an overall event rate of 24.4% as shown in Table 3. Oral health status was significantly related to events (p,0.0001) with event rates demonstrating a gradient as related to worsening of oral health from a rate of 10.5% among dentate, periodontally healthy individuals increasing to 23.8% among those with severe periodontal disease with the highest rate of COPD events among those who have lost all teeth due to oral diseases (43.9%). As Expected, there was an increased event rate with increased GOLDstage, p,0.0001 with those having GOLD Stage III/IV disease experiencing approximately 3.4 times the event rate as those with GOLD stages I–II. COPD subjects who experienced events were more likely to be Caucasian, younger, male, diabetic, hypertensive, tobacco user (current or former), low income and less educated.The unadjusted Kaplan Meier Curve showing the event rates for COPD hospitalization/death for all subjects with GOLD stages of I, II and III/IV appear in Figure 2. As suggested by the dentate status and periodontal disease data in Table 3, the survival function clearly separated periodontal health from edentulous individuals, while those with Entry and Severe forms of periodontal disease exhibited intermediate survival functions.Overall, the oral health status has a dramatic effect on unadjusted event-free survival rates among COPD subjects with a log rank p-value of,0.0001. However, the effects of adjustment for relevant covariates and confounders on these trends are shown in Table 4.Cox proportional hazards models using the periodontally healthy dentate group as the referent population in unadjusted models demonstrate a clear trend and a gradient with increasing periodontal disease severity increasing the hazards ratios (HR)from 1.90 (95% confidence interval: 1.28–2.83) to 2.22 (1.44–3.41)and 4.66 (3.21–6.78) for edentulism. After adjustment for relevant confounders from Table 1 including age, race, center, gender and smoking, only edentulism remains a significant risk factor for events with a hazard ratio of 2.45 (1.61–3.74). Inclusion of additional variables in the final model did not contribute to the overall fit of the model.The effects of oral health status on COPD-related events are stratified by GOLD stage in Table 5. In unadjusted models for GOLD stage I subjects there is an apparent trend of increasing hazard ratio associated with periodontal disease severity with the highest risk observed in the edentulous individuals [HR = 5.06(2.60–9.85)]. However, after adjustment for center, race, gender,age, smoking, education and BMI, only edentulism remained statistically significant albeit with attenuated risk [HR = 2.37(1.03–5.45)]. The effect of oral disease on events for subjects with GOLD stage II demonstrated a similar pattern as GOLD Isubjects, with a comparable magnitude of risk [HR = 2.12 (1.17–3.83)] for edentulous subjects. There was no association between oral status and events among GOLD stage III/IV subjects(Table 5).Serum biomarkers of inflammation including IL-6, CRP and ICAM-1 have been associated with periodontal disease and COPD morbidity. Table 6 and 7 explore the potential role of these systemic mediators as intermediary explanatory variables that link the observed association between oral disease and COPD morbidity. Subjects with higher levels of serum IL-6, CRP or sCAM had higher event rates (Table 6). For example, subjects with the lowest levels of IL-6 (lowest quartile) experienced lowerevent rates (7.5%) as compared to subjects in the highest quartile of serum IL-6 (41.8%). All three biomarkers were associated with statistically significantly higher event rates when elevated in the highest quartile; however, these significant trends are unadjusted.The models that include oral health status and serum IL-6 levels by quartiles, and another that includes oral health status and quartile of serum CRP are shown in Table 7. Models that include oral health status and sICAM are not shown because no significant associations with events were observed. Table 7 displays unad-justed and fully adjusted Models. These Cox Proportional Hazards Models include both oral disease status using Periodontal Health as the referent group and the lowest quartile of IL-6 or CRP as the referent group. In the unadjusted IL-6 model severe periodontal disease and edentulism as well as all three of the upper quartiles ofIL-6 remain significantly associated with increased HR. There is a gradient response noted with increasing IL-6 levels. In the fully adjusted models severe periodontal disease is no longer significantly associated with increased risk, but edentulism remains significant [HR = 2.66 (1.34–5.29)] as well as serum IL-6 levels[upper quartile [(HR = 3.37 (1.49–7.63)]) within the same models,suggesting independent but approximately comparable effect sizeon the hazard rate. A similar pattern is present for the effects of oral health status on events when including serum levels of CRP,but CRP level was not a significant effect modifier in adjusted models. Thus, among the three inflammatory biomarkers serum IL-6 has a significant interaction with oral health status to increase the hazard rate for events when serum IL-6 levels are elevated. For Example, among edentate subjects with highest quartile of serum IL-6, the Hazard ratio for COPD related events was 8.9.However, based upon the data shown in Table 5, the effects of oral disease and serum IL-6 on morbidity would not be expected to be evident for all COPD GOLD Stages. Figure 3a illustrates the Kaplan-Meier survival function for quartiles of serum IL-6 stratified by GOLD Stage. The effects of elevated IL-6 on COPD events is evident among subjects with GOLD stage I and GOLD stage II, but not for GOLD stage III/IV. A significant gradient for increased risk for events with increasing IL-6 levels (by quartile) was observed in subjects with GOLD stage I and II disease (p = 0.004 and p = 0.008, respectively). No effects are significant for CRP levels for any of the GOLD stages in Figure 3B. These data suggest that serum levels of IL-6 independently contribute to COPD-related events among those with GOLD stage I and GOLD stage II disease.Discussion In this population-based longitudinal study, we observed a statistically significant association between oral health status and COPD-related events, even adjusting for conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. Spirometry values were used to determine GOLD stage as described in the Methods section. As Shown in Table 1, incidence of COPD-related events had a monotonic positive association with GOLD stage ranging from 12.4% for individuals with a GOLD stage of I to 49.6% for those with a GOLD stage of III/IV.Edentulism and COPD-Related Events We found that edentulous (total loss of teeth) individuals who had been diagnosed with COPD had a higher incidence and were at greater risk (HR = 2.28 and 95% CI = 1.46–3.56) of having a COPD related event (hospitalization and death) than individuals who had teeth and whose mouths had healthy periodontal status(tables 1 and 2). This excess risk was independent of the effects of age, race, sex, field center, smoking, pack years, hypertension,education, and BMI. In additional, fully adjusted models, we found that being edentulous conveyed excess risk for COPD-related events even when stratified by GOLD score for individuals who were classified as GOLD stage I or GOLD stage II at baseline (Table 3). However, being edentulous did not convey excess risk for COPD-related events for those study participants who were classified as GOLD III/IV at baseline.Finally, we showed that edentulous individuals who had levels of serum IL-6 in the highest two quartiles were at even higher risk for COPD-related events. These findings suggest that the risk for COPD-related events after adjusting for potential confounders may be attributable to both edentulism and elevated serum IL-6 levels.There are a number of potential mechanisms that may underlie this association and additional factors that may account for the findings. Because COPD is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung parenchyma to inhaled pollutants and gases, an apparent explanation for the detection of systemic inflammation on these patients was a hypothesis that systemic inflammation in COPD was originating in a form of‘‘spillover’’ of the pulmonary compartment, which has not been proven [14].However one reason for our finding that edentulism is predictive of COPD-related events may be that more than 97%of the study participants who had lost all of their teeth have dentures and it is known that biofilm that forms on dentures canhouse bacteria, yeasts and fungi that result in inflammatory response from the oral tissues. Similar to the biofilm on natural teeth, denture biofilm is complex due to the types and numbers of organisms it contains, as well as its organized structure. Recently Glass et al. reported on the complex nature of the microbial flora contained within the denture biofilm, identifying over 900 individual species of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts and amoebae [9]. Others have reported similar complexities for the microbial content of denture plaque [15]. It has also been long recognized that unlike the dental biofilm, the biofilm that forms on denture materials harbors a much larger population of yeasts, and Candida yeasts, and specifically Candida albicans, have been shown to have strong pathogenic associations with the presence of denture stomatitis [15,16,17,18,19,20] .Since periodontal disease does lead to major tooth loss in a subset of the population that have a strong inflammatory response to infection, it is likely that infections on dentures will lead to asimilar inflammatory response. Thus, those study participants who lost their teeth due to periodontal disease and have an inflammatory response to the pathogenic/fungus may be hyper-inflammatory responders who are more susceptible to having incident COPD-related events that lead to hospitalization and death. Since reduction of most bacteria related to periodontal disease is expected after full mouth tooth extraction, these individuals may have reduced their systemic levels of inflammation due to periodontal infections [21]. However, they may have increased their overall risk for COPD related events via denture biofilm accumulation, as suggested by the significant prevalence of denture use in this studied edentulous population.The increased levels of the inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP that parallel the severity of periodontal disease in association with higher incidence of COPD-related events support a potential systemic origin of the inflammation and, additionally, also strongly suggest that edentulism is a relevant factor in the morbidity of inflamed COPD patients.Our study also indicated that while severe periodontal disease was not significantly associated with COPD-related events among study participants classified as GOLD stage III/IV, it was significantly associated among those study participants with GOLD stage I or II disease, even when adjusting for confounders(Table 5). However, when either serum IL-6 or CRP was added to the model, severe periodontal disease was no longer significantly associated (Table 7).One reason this may have occurred is that the majority of tooth loss can be attributed to two conditions; dental caries and periodontal disease, with periodontal disease tending to increase with age and being responsible for the majority of tooth loss in a subgroup of the population. Periodontal disease has been associated with a variety of systemic, inflammatory conditions and there is evidence to indicate that components associated with host immune and inflammatory responses as well as systemic exposure to oral pathogens are involved [22,23]. Other studies have shown that treating periodontal disease results in reduction of serum inflammatory biomarkers, indicating that periodontal disease may enhance systemic inflammation [24,25]. Thus, if periodontal disease and these serum biomarkers share the same causal pathway, it was not surprising that severe periodontal disease was no longer significant in individuals in the highest two quartiles of serum IL-6 when being edentulous remained significant.Our study design may be another potential reason that severe periodontal disease did not remain significant in the model. Theoral examination was conducted only at the baseline of this study and periodontal status may have changed. For example, study participants may have sought treatment as a result of the examination and their periodontal status improved; or their periodontal status may have deteriorated and they lost all their teeth and became edentulous; or participants who were healthy at baseline may have acquired periodontal disease. Any of these changes in periodontal status would have resulted in misclassification of the exposure leading to bias towards the null. Conversely,edentulous status would not have changed and would have resulted in minimal, if any, misclassification of that potentialexposure.An additional important contribution of this study is that after adjusting for confounders including BMI, smoking status, race,gender, hypertension and diabetes, IL-6 and CRP, which are two key markers of chronic inflammation, showed association with oral health conditions.It also should be noted that this study sample is predominantly a middle age to older group [mean age 63.9 years old (SD = 5.69)].Thus the incident rates of COPD-related events are higher than would be found in the general US population. For example, the incidence of hospitalization due to COPD during 2005 was estimated to be 23.6 per 10,000 [26], while Table 1 reports the incidence of COPD-related events to be 24.4 per hundred individuals in this study. In addition to this being an older group,everyone in this study had at least GOLD stage I disease. Thus,the associations shown in this study may not be representative of the entire US population. In summary, the results of this population based study showed that edentulism, which reflects a complex pattern of environmental, pathogenic and socioeconomic conditions, is predictive of COPD-related events and thus provides further evidence supporting the notion that poor oral health is an important public healthissue.Author Contributions Conceived and designed the experiments: SO JB RS ZL.

Obstructive airway disease and edentulism in the atherosclerosis risk in communities (ARIC) study,"Steven Offenbacher, James D Beck, Silvana P Barros, Robert Y Suruki, Zvi G Loewy","Objectives:We examined the potential association between prior chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) and edentulism, and whether the association varied by COPD severity using data from the Dental Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.Design:Cross-sectional.Setting:Community dwelling subjects from four US communities.Participants and measurements:Cases were identified as edentulous (without teeth) and subjects with one or more natural teeth were identified as dentate.COPD cases were defined by spirometry measurements that showed the ratio of forced expiratory volume (1 s) to vital capacity to be less than 0.7. The severity of COPD cases was also determined using a modified Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Classification criteria (GOLD stage I–IV). Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the association between COPD and edentulism, while adjusting for age, gender,centre/race, ethnicity, education level, income, diabetes,hypertension, coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure, body mass index, smoking, smokeless tobacco use and alcohol consumption.Results:13 465 participants were included in this analysis (2087 edentulous; 11 378 dentate).Approximately 28.3% of edentulous participants had prior COPD compared with 19.6% among dentate participants(p<0.0001). After adjustment for potential confounders,we observed a 1.3 (1.08 to 1.62) and 2.5 (1.68 to 3.63)fold increased risk of edentulism among GOLD II and GOLD III/IV COPD, respectively, as compared with the non-COPD/dentate referent. Given the short period of time between the measurements of COPD (visit 2) and dentatestatus (visit 4) relative to the natural history of both diseases, neither temporality nor insight as to the directionality of the association can be ascertained.Conclusions:We found a statistically significant association between prior COPD and edentulism, with evidence of a positive incremental effect seen with increasing GOLD classification.","ARTICLE SUMMARY Article focus▪We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a community-dwelling population of 13 465 participants enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC).▪We searched for a potential association between edentulism and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) scoring levels for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD).▪Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association while adjusting for multiple covariates and confounders.Key messages▪We found a statistically significant association between edentulism (no teeth) and prior obstructive airway disease in fully adjusted models with incremental effects with increasing GOLD classification.▪A similar association with periodontal disease severity and COPD among those with teeth(dentate) was also observed.Strengths and limitations of this study▪This is a large representative population that includes African Americans that has full periodontal examination and respiratory function data.▪A GOLD stage was determined by standardized lung function testing.▪A limitation arises from the minor temporal discrepancy in the collection of the periodontal examination data and the respiratory function assessments. INTRODUCTION Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) is currently the fifth leading cause of death worldwide, and is expected to rise to fourth place in 2030.1Although COPD has a heterogeneous clinical presentation primarily characterised by airflow limitation,generally associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs,2it is also often associated with a significant systemic inflammatory response 3 which has been correlated with adverse clinical effects.34 Over the past decade there has been an increased interest in the link between respiratory diseases and oral infection. Higher levels of tooth-associated microorganisms (plaque) and periodontal disease have been associated with COPD.5.7 Recently, in a very comprehensive oral microbiology study, high levels of diverse microbes—including several implicated in COPD and denture stomatitis—were identified on previously worn dentures.8th, both the teeth and the dentures are non-desquamating oral surfaces that allow the oral biofilm to emerge eliciting periodontal disease or denture stomatitis, respectively. This raises the question as to whether denture-associated microbes may contribute to COPD in a manner analogous to periodontal organisms. Because oral infections and denture-based sources of sepsis are both treatable and preventable, the potential association of high microbial burden of oral origin to COPD may represent modifiable risk factors that may potentially improve respiratory-related morbidity. It has been suggested by Garciaetal7that theobserved association between oral health and COPD may be due to the aspiration of oral pathogens, or a common underlying host susceptibility trait that place individuals at risk for both conditions such as an exaggerated inflammatory response that is triggered by oral microbes.Although numerous studies have examined the association between oral health and respiratory diseases indentate individuals, the published literature are scant with respect to studies that have examined the association between edentulism and COPD status/severity. We Undertook the current study to examine the potential association between COPD and edentulism using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)Study. We hypothesize that edentulism would be associated with a diagnosis of COPD and display a higher prevalence with spirometry categories of more pronounced COPD. These data include not only dentatestatus and full-mouth periodontal examination measurements, but also include results from direct pulmonary function tests and symptomatology assessments that enabled classification of COPD severity.METHODS We sought to test the hypothesis that the prevalence of edentulism was greater among individuals with a reported history of lung disease (ie, COPD) and that the association with edentulism varied by COPD severity as determined by a modified Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung disease (GOLD) criteria. Our second hypothesis was that among dentate subjects there was a difference in the prevalence of periodontal disease according to the severity of COPD as measured by GOLD criteria.Study population and study design The entire cohort from the ARIC study was 15 792 andthe available dental cohort Dental ARIC (D-ARIC) data were used to study participants with both a periodontal examination and completed spirometry data. The Cohort selection process and reasons for exclusion appear in figure 1. Descriptions of the cohort and the periodontal examination procedure have been described previously.Eligible participants were all aged 45–64 at study entry (ie, visit 1) and had spirometry measurements at visit 2 (3 years later) and periodontal examinations at D-ARIC visit 4 (6 years from visit 2).Case definitions Edentulism case definitions were defined as study participants without any natural teeth or implants.Participants with one or more natural teeth (comprising 11 378 subjects) were selected as the dentate subjects.The absence, presence or severity of periodontal disease among dentate subjects was determined using the joint American Association of Periodontology/Center for Disease Control (AAP/CDC) consensus definitions of Health, Early and Advanced disease.10 This investigation represents the first report that uses actual pulmonary function data to assess lung function as an exposure related to edentulism or periodontal disease. The measured exposure of pulmonary function was classified both as a dichotomous (eg, COPD vs COPD) and ordinal categorical variable (eg, no lung disease, restrictive disease, COPD GOLD stages I–IV),using the following criteria.Airway obstruction Dichotomous variable (COPD/no COPD)—prior airway obstruction (or COPD) was defined based on spirometry measurements collected during visit 2. Participants with a ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) less than 0.7 were determined to have airway obstruction consistent with COPD.Ordinal categorical variable (COPD GOLD stage)—severity of COPD was also examined in this study among COPD participants using a modification of the spirometry-based criteria for severity outlined in the GOLD guidelines.11 12 Variables of interest Smoking data (both for cigarettes and cigars) collected during visit 4 were used to adjust for the confounding effect of smoking on the relationship between airway obstruction (COPD) and being edentulous. Smoking Was treated as a five-level categorical variable, as described in detail previously.7 Cardiovascular disease comorbidities that may be associated with both history of airway obstruction and being edentulous were also examined using data from visit 4. Other potential confounders examined included race and examination centre, ethnicity, education level, income, frequency of dental visits, diabetes, body mass index, alcohol use and medication utilisation. These data were extracted from visit 4.Data analysis Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between COPD and edentulous status. This Was followed by a logistic regression analysis of the dentate subjects comparing the COPD prevalence and severity of dentate patients without periodontal disease to that of dentate patients with periodontal disease.The exposure variable, which is airway obstruction, was examined as both a dichotomous variable (eg, positive prior COPD vs no COPD) and by logistic models using nominal variables (eg, no lung disease, restrictive disease, GOLD 0–IV) based on spirometry data collected as part of the ARCTIC examination. For the no COPD orGOLD reference group we included: subjects with and without chronic respiratory symptoms with no lung function abnormality and subjects with GOLD 0 and restrictive disease. Multiple regression models were used to control for confounding. When adjusting for potential confounding variables we included in certain models variables that are known to modify either periodontal disease status or COPD, including body mass index and smokeless tobacco. We developed minimally and fully adjusted logistic models incorporating significant confounders and effect modifiers to compute OR and 95%CI using SAS V.9.2 (Cary, North Carolina, USA). We also included traditional risk factors for edentulism, periodontal disease and COPD–such as age, even if not statistically significant in this cohort. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant for this study.Sample size and power calculations We knew a priori that the ARIC cohort who had spirometry data from visit 2 included 2087 edentulous subjects,as determined by questionnaire data at visit 4. We also had 11 378 dentate subjects with spirometry data atvisit 2, of which 5155 subjects had a full-mouth periodontal examination completed. Thus, if approximately 9% of the 13 465 subjects (2087 edentulous and 11 378 dentate) were determined to have COPD, we estimated that we had >99% power to detect a significant difference of 1% at p=0.05 in the prevalence of COPD when comparing edentulous versus dentate subjects.RESULTS ARE subject participation was based upon the inception cohort of 15 792 subjects. The visit 4 screenings are broadly divided into 11 378 dentate and 2 087 edentulous subjects who also had spirometry data. These subjects are used for analyses end tables 1–6 on the relationship between dentate status and COPD. Subjects Were excluded (n=2327) from the original inception participants for incomplete data, dental implants only andmissing visit 4 screening.The distribution of study subjects according to dentatestatus and GOLD stage is shown in table 1. Among the edentulous subjects (2087), there were 591 or 28.3%with COPD (GOLD stages I–IV). With the exception of GOLD IN where the prevalence of edentulism was 14.7%,the prevalence of edentulous individuals increased from 16.4% for GOLD 0 to 35.6% for GOLD III/IV. The Crude OR (not shown in table 1) for edentulism being associated with prior COPD versus no COPD was 1.62(95% CI 1.46 to 1.80). Approximately 13% of individuals with no chronic respiratory symptoms and no lung function abnormality (ie, no lung disease) were edentulous.There were 2232 subjects with prior COPD (19.6%)among 11 378 dentate subjects.Table 2 presents the prevalence of various subject characteristics according to GOLD classification. In this table, the GOLD reference group for statistical testing combines the following three categories of subjects: nolung disease, GOLD 0 and subjects with chronic respiratory symptoms but no lung function abnormality. The General patterns reflected in table 2 show that compared with the reference group those subjects in the GOLD III and IV category were much more likely to be edentulous, to smoke, to use smokeless tobacco, to be African American or North Carolina Caucasians, men and somewhat more likely to have lower levels of income and education, and to be older and more likely to have chronic heart failure and heart disease.Table presents multivariable logistic models for the relationship between edentulous/dentate status and GOLD stages using the GOLD reference group described above. In an unadjusted model individuals with GOLD II and III/IV scores were at significantly higher odds for edentulism that increased with increasing GOLD stage severity (OR=2.06; 95% CI 1.79 to 2.38and OR=3.38; 95% CI 2.61 to 4.39, respectively).Minimally adjusted models (race/centre, sex and age)showed similar significant effects for GOLD II and III/IV with little attenuation. The increased risks of being edentulous for GOLD II and III/IV categories remain significant, but have slightly lower ORs. However, the fully adjusted model showed more attenuation with the odds for being edentulous being 1.3 (1.08 to 1.62) and 2.5 (1.68 to 3.63) times greater for GOLD II disease and the most severe category GOLD III/IV, respectively.Table 4shows the association between periodontal status and GOLD classifications for the dentate subjects.Because of small cell sizes in the GOLD III and IV groups, we combined them with GOLD II. Using the CDC/AAP classification of periodontal disease, which is based upon clusters of clinical signs, there is a significant positive association between higher GOLD stage and severe periodontal disease (p<0.0001). Subjects with GOLD I or GOLD II–IV were more likely to have severe periodontitis than the reference group. With respect to the individual periodontal variables measured as means or extent scores, individuals with a GOLD stage I were more likely to have a greater extent of periodontal pocket depths of 4 mm or more, greater extent of attachment loss of 3 mm or more, a higher mean attachment loss and a greater extent of plaque in their mouths than the reference group. Those with GOLF scores of II–IV were significantly higher on all periodontal measures and had fewer teeth compared with the reference group.Logistic models for the association between GOLDstage and periodontal status using the AAP/CDC definitions appear in table 5.Opentable 4, small cell size resulted in grouping the more severe GOLD stage together as GOLD II/III/IV. In general, the ORs for severe periodontal disease increased with more severe GOLD stage in the crude, minimally adjusted and fully adjusted models. There is also an increase in odds as the severity of periodontal disease increases for the twoFOLD categories shown using the periodontally healthy group as the reference group within each GOLD cat-egory. Although adjusting for relevant confounders generally decreased the odds, there was still a statistically significant association between higher GOLD stage and severe periodontal disease in the fully adjusted model(OR=1.41; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.87).The relationship between spirometry-based GOLD classification and self-reported physician-based diagnosis of bronchitis or emphysema is shown in table 6.Participants classified as GOLD III/IV were significantly more likely to have self-reported bronchitis or emphysema. There is a trend for a positive association except for the GOLD zero category. Interestingly, 65.9% of subjects with GOLD III/IV report no diagnosis of COPD suggesting that self-report of bronchitis or emphysema is not a strong predictor of GOLD stage. In fact, of all subjects reporting a positive diagnosis of bronchitis or emphysema 53% demonstrated no evidence of chronic respiratory symptoms and no lung function abnormality.DISCUSSION We found a statistically significant association between prior COPD and edentulism, with evidence of an increasing prevalence of edentulism with increasing GOLD stage. Although there was some reduction in the magnitude of effect in the adjusted models, the association between dentate status and GOLD stage remained statistically significant even in the fully adjusted model,with a 1.3-fold increased odds of being edentulous inthe GOLD II category and a 2.5-fold increased odds of being edentulous in the most severe GOLD III/IV category in the fully adjusted regression model. This represents the first report of an association between edentulism and COPD in a population with spirometrymeasurements.In the subgroup of dentate subjects, there was a significant association between the GOLD II–IV group versus the GOLD reference group and prevalent periodontal disease with a statistically significant increase in the odds of entry level and severe periodontal disease in the crude and minimally adjusted models. In the fully adjusted model, only the association between GOLD II/III/IV and severe periodontal disease (OR 1.41 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.87))remained statistically significant. This is the first population report to include both full-mouth periodontal examination data as well as spirometry assessments, thereby providing direct confirmation of the association between severe periodontal disease and COPD, as well as a dose–response relationship between these conditions.While there is no previous published information available about the association between edentulism status and COPD, there is evidence in the literature of an association between periodontal disease and COPD,consistent with the findings of the current study.5–7Theresults of this investigation were based on standardised pulmonary function tests and suggest that studies that are based upon self-reported diagnoses can potentially result in statistically significant misclassification error.Our data shown in table 6 suggest that of the 12 297 subjects reporting no diagnosis, 2390 subjects or 19.4%were classified as GOLD I–IV. Among those 433 subjects with GOLD I–IV the positive predictive rate was only 15.3%. These Findings suggest that an important strength of the current study was the classification of disease based on an objective biological measure (eg,spirometry) rather than a self-reported measure.Additional strengths of the current study include the large sample size, the inclusion of African Americans Providing some racial diversity of the sample, the use of a full-mouth examination protocol and the collection of information about key confounding variables, including but not limited to: tobacco use, hypertension, diabetes and income. Furthermore, the outcomes of interest,edentulism and periodontal disease, were evaluated using a comprehensive oral examination at visit 4.The current study must also be considered in light of certain limitations. First, the design of the current study does not allow us to determine the directionality of temporality of any association found. It has been reported previously that the dental ARIC subsample is healthier than the greater ARIC sample and that the edentulous subjects within the ARCTIC dataset have overall poorer health,9as compared with the ARIC dental sample.Thus, it is possible that the observed relationship between both edentulism and periodontal disease with prior COPD may be due in part to shared risk factors.There is also the potential bias due to differential loss to follow-up prior to visit 4. The current study included only those subjects with dental history information atvisit 4. Finally, it is possible that participants with COPD may have been more likely to be lost to follow-up (compared with participants without COPD) or that participants with more severe COPD may have had a lower probability of surviving to visit 4 than participants with mild COPD or normal lung function. There are no data in this report to mechanistically link edentulism with increased risk for COPD. Previous studies of periodontal disease associations with COPD have discussed the potential role of periodontal infection serving as a chronic repository of pathogenic oral organisms that could be aspirated into the airway to challenge the lungs.6 Periodontal infections are also associated with increases in systemic markers of inflammation including biomarkers such as C reactive protein.13 By analogy,edentulism is commonly associated with denture infections (denture mucositis) which induce mucosal inflammation and unclean dentures can also pose as a chronic reservoir of oral pathogens. However, the potential role of denture-based infection as a potential risk factor for COPD remains to be elucidated.CONCLUSIONS Edentulism was associated with prior COPD, with an incremental effect observed with increasing GOLDstage. Additionally, among dentate individuals, severe periodontal disease was associated with GOLD classification. This is one of the first analyses of COPD and dentate status, and expands upon the available literature regarding periodontal disease and COPD.

Tooth Loss and Head and Neck Cancer: A Meta-Analysis Of Observational Studies,"Xian-Tao Zeng, Wei Luo, Wei Huang, Quan Wang, Yi Guo, Wei-Dong Leng","Background: Epidemiological studies have shown that tooth loss is associated with risk of head and neck cancer (HNC); however, the results were inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to ascertain the relationship between tooth loss and HNC. Methods:We searched for relevant observational studies that tested the association between tooth loss and risk of HNC from PubMed and were conducted up to January 30, 2013. Data from the eligible studies were independently extracted by two authors. The meta-analysis was performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 2.2 software. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence of various inclusions. Publication bias was also detected. Results: Ten articles involving one cohort and ten case-control studies were yielded. Based on random-effects meta-analysis,an association between tooth loss and HNC risk was identified [increased risk of 29% for 1 to 6 teeth loss (OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 0.52–3.20, p = 0.59), 58% for 6 to 15 teeth loss (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.08–2.32, p = 0.02), 63% for 11+teeth loss (OR = 1.63,95% CI = 1.23–2.14, p,0.001), 72% for 15+ teeth loss (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.26–2.36, p,0.001), and 89% for 20+teeth loss(OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.27–2.80, p,0.001)]. The sensitivity analysis shows that the result was robust, and publication bias was not detected. Conclusions: Based on the current evidence, tooth loss is probably a significant and dependent risk factor of HNC, which may have a dose-response effect. People who lost six or more teeth should pay attention to symptoms of HNC, and losing 11 teeth or 15 teeth may be the threshold.","Introduction Head and neck cancer (HNC) mainly originates in the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. HNC accounts for 12% of all malignancies worldwide. An estimated total of 400000 cases of oral cavity and pharynx diseases, 160000 cases of laryngeal cancer, and 300000 mortality per year [1]. Therefore, finding and preventing the risk factors are important and significant research areas. In the past decades, smoking (active and passive), alcohol, genetic factors, viral infection (mostly human papillomavirus), sex, and occupational exposure have been identified as significant risk factors for HNC. Among these factors, smoking and alcohol are the most significant [2,3]. Tooth loss has been considered to influence food choice, diets, nutrition intake, and esthetics significantly [4]. A systematic review and meta-analysis provided that tooth loss is associated with the impairment of the oral health- related quality of life and the location and distribution of tooth loss significantly and independently affect the severity of the impairment [5]. Epidemiological studies has shown that age, gender, diabetes, social and geographical disparities, smoking, patients and dentists attitudes on oral health status, and alcohol are the risk factors of tooth loss [6,7,8,9]. Both HNC and tooth loss share common risk factors; moreover, given their special anatomic location, an interesting assumption was formed on whether or not an association between tooth loss and HNC existed? Zheng et al (1990) [10] first investigated the association between HNC and tooth loss, and found that tooth loss is a strong risk factor for oral cancer in both males and females. Since then, many relevant studies have been published. However, these studies provided inconsistent or even contradictory results. In addition, the threshold on the number of missing tooth that both patients and dentists showed pay attention to remains unclear. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (File S1) [11] and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines [12], to obtain a more precise estimation on the association between tooth loss and HNC. Methods Eligibility Criteria Cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies that evaluated the association between tooth loss and HNC and those that meet the following criteria were considered eligible for inclusion: (1) full-text could be obtained; (2) clear diagnostic criteria for HNC and definition of tooth loss were reported; and (3) the adjusted and/or unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), or relative risks (RRs), and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), or the numbers of events that can calculate these factors, were reported. If more than one study covered the same population, only the report containing the most comprehensive information on that population was included. Two authors independently evaluated the eligibility of all the retrieved studies, and disagreements were resolved by discussion. Search Strategy The PubMed database was searched up to January 30, 2013 (re-searched on August 31, 2013) for published studies that tested the association between tooth loss and HNC. The search term (‘‘head and neck cancer’’ OR ‘‘oral cancer’’ OR ‘‘oropharyngeal cancer’’ OR ‘‘pharyngeal cancer’’ OR ‘‘laryngeal cancer’’) AND (‘‘dentition’’ OR ‘‘tooth loss’’) was used. We also reviewed the reference lists of included articles and recent reviews. Data Extraction Two authors independently collected and tabulated the following information of each eligible study: the first author’s surname, year of publication, study design, country of origin, sample size, number of events, age range, assessment of tooth loss and HNC, tumor site and pathologic type of HNC, crude or adjusted point estimates and relevant 95% CIs, and the covariates for the adjusted point estimates. The design of most of the included studies was a case-control study and reported ORs. Only one study was prospective cohort and reported HR [13]. We directly considered HR as RR, and then transformed RR into OR by using the following formula [14]: RR=OR/[(1-P0)+(P0xOR), where P0 is the incidence of the outcome of interest in the non-exposed group. The standard error (SE) of the resulting converted OR was then determined using the following formula: SE log (RR)=SE log (OR)x|log (RR)/log (OR). Given that these transformations can overestimate the variance of OR derived from RR [15], we performed a sensitivity analysis by omitting the study. The numbers of lost tooth varied in the included studies; hence, we gathered and categorized these teeth into five categories as follows: lost 1 to 6 teeth, 6 to 15 teeth, 11+ teeth, 15+ teeth, and 20+ teeth. Data Analysis We computed a pooled OR and relevant 95% CI by using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 2.2 (Biostat, Englewood, New Jersey) [16] to generate the forest plots and to assess heterogeneity of the included studies. Heterogeneity was quantified using the Q and I2 statistics [17], and the heterogeneity was defined as low, moderate, and high based on I2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively [18]. When the I2#25%, which indicates no evidence of heterogeneity, we used the fixed-effect model; otherwise, we used the random-effects model. In the presence of heterogeneity, we performed sensitivity analysis to explore the possible explanations for heterogeneity by removing each study in each turn to test the robustness of the main results or by switching the fixed and random effects models. We used the Stata 12.0 software for the dose-response estimates based on pooled ORs and 95% CIs by each category of the number of lost teeth. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plots and the Egger linear regression test [19]. In addition, we calculated the number of unpublished studies that would negate the results and the pooled OR adjusted for publication bias by using the ‘trim and fill’ method to assess the effect of possible publication bias [20]. Results Study Selection and Characteristics From the 82 records initially found, 10 articles involving 11 case-control studies [10,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29] and one cohort study [13] were included in this meta-analysis. A detailed flow chart of the selection process is shown in Fig. 1. From the included studies, the study of Guha et al. [27] contains two multicentric case-control studies from central Europe (including Romania, Poland, and Russia) and Latin America (including Cuba, Argentina, and Brazil), whereas the other 10 were single center studies. All of the cases were histologically, pathologically or cytologically confirmed as HNC, and clearly defined the referenced group of tooth loss, with the major characteristics presented in Table 1. All of the studies reported adjusted the point estimates and 95% CIs. The adjusted covariates are shown in Table 2. Tooth Loss and Risk of HNC Three studies reported 1 to 6 teeth loss and risk of HNC. Among the three studies, one [10] showed a significantly positive association between tooth loss and the risk of HNC, the other two were negative [21,26]. Overall, no association between 1 to 6 teeth loss and HNC (OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 0.52–3.20, p = 0.59; Table 3) was observed. Substantial heterogeneity was observed (p,0.001, I2= 85.59%). Nine articles involving 10 studies [10,13,21,23,24,25,26,27,28] reported 6 to 15 teeth loss and risk of HNC, where obviously heterogeneity was observed (p,0.001, I2= 82.92%). The result from the random-effects model showed that 6 to 15 teeth loss could significantly increase the risk of developing HNC by 1.58 times (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.08–2.32, p = 0.02; Table 3). All the included studies reported their result based on the random-effects model (p,0.001, I2= 74.41%) of 11+ teeth loss and the risk of HNC. A significantly increased risk for developing HNC by 1.63 times was observed (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.23–2.14, p,0.001; Table 3). All of the included studies reported 15+ teeth loss and the risk of HNC. The result of the meta-analysis showed that 15+ teeth loss could significantly increase the risk of HNC by 1.72 times (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.26–2.36, p,0.001; Fig. 2). Substantial heterogeneity was observed (p,0.001, I 2= 76.53%). The pooled result of the three case-control studies [22,26,29] indicated that exposure to 20+ teeth loss could increase the risk of HNC by 1.89 times (OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.27–2.80, p,0.001; Table 3) based on the random-effects model (p = 0.14, I2= 49.93%). Fig. 3 shows the trend of the simulative dose-response effect based on the ORs and the corresponding CIs of the numbers of lost teeth, which indicated that the association between tooth loss and HNC risk may have a dose-response relationship. Sensitivity and Subgroups Analyses Table 3 shows the results of the sensitivity and subgroups analyses. We switched all the random-effects models to the fixed effect models, which indicated that all the results were not substantial changed. We removed the study of Michaud et al. [13], which reported HR yielded similar results and with substantial evidence of heterogeneity. Further exclusion of any single study did not materially alter the combined OR, with a range from 1.40 (95% CI = 1.14–1.73, p,0.001) to 1.77 (95% CI = 1.35–2.32, p,0.001) of 11+ teeth loss, and from 1.48 (95% CI = 1.14–1.91, p,0.001) to 1.90 (95% CI = 1.40–2.57, p,0.001) of 15+ teeth loss (Fig. 4). The results of the subgroup analyses were varied, especially for the country of origin. Publication Bias Visual inspection of the funnel plot did not identify any substantial asymmetry (Fig. 5) and the Egger linear regression test also indicated no evidence of publication bias among the studies (for 6–15 teeth loss, p = 0.31; for 11+ teeth loss, p = 0.14; for 15+ teeth loss, p = 0.10). The ‘‘trim and fill’’ method identified any possible missing studies (Fig. 5) and the adjustment estimated OR was similar to the original estimate (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.26–2.36). Discussion Main Findings The association between tooth loss and HNC is still not fully understood. Our meta-analysis of the 11 case-control studies and one cohort study provides evidence that individuals would face increased risk of HNC by 29% for those with 1 to 6 teeth loss, 58% for 6 to 15 teeth loss, 63% for 11+ teeth loss, 72% for 15+ teeth loss, and 89% for 20+ teeth loss compared with the reference group. These results indicate that greater teeth loss is associated with an increased risk of HNC. In other words, a dose-response relationship exists between tooth loss and HNC (Fig. 3). Except for 1 to 6 teeth loss, the results all have significant statistical difference, which suggests that tooth loss is probably a significant risk factor for HNC. Tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking are known risk factors for HNC. In our meta-analysis, all the studies adjusted smoking and alcohol, except for one case-control study published in 2003 by Lissowska et al. [25]. Several studies also adjusted age, gender, ethnicity, body mass index, education, and other oral health variables, which suggests that tooth loss is probably an independent risk factor of HNC. All the included studies contained both males and females. The study by Zheng et al. [10] provided the respective data for males and females, and their results show that females were more vulnerable than males. Thus, regardless if the patient is male or female, tooth loss is probably a risk factor for HNC. Sources of Heterogeneity Substantial heterogeneity was observed among the studies of tooth loss and HNC risk, which is not surprising because of the differences in the characteristics of populations, definition of the reference and tooth loss group(s), and the adjustment for confounding factors. Our sensitivity analysis (by changing the effect models, removing the cohort study, and omitting every single study each time) and subgroup analysis (by study design, definition of reference group, and country origin) results provide evidence that country of origin and definition of reference group probably contributed to the heterogeneity. Strengths and Limitations The major strength of our study is that this it is the first to perform meta-analysis on this topic. We searched relevant published studies via electronic and hand searching. To the best of our knowledge, we have collected all published studies that met the inclusion criteria and the publication bias test also provided no evidence of publication bias. Moreover, we performed sensitivity analysis by using three methods and subgroups analysis based on the study design, definition of the reference group, country of origin, which could improve the reliability of the results and reduce the performance bias of the meta-analysis. Third, the association of tooth loss with the risk of HNC persisted and remained without substantial change in the sensitivity analyses based on various methods. In addition, the subgroup analysis results indicate that, with accumulating evidence and enlarged sample sizes, the statistical power is enhanced to provide more precise and reliable risk estimates. Finally, our results were based on adjusted estimates, thereby making the result more credible than unadjusted ones. However, there was an interesting finding when we researched the PubMed database on August 31, 2013. We found there was a similar paper by Wang RS et al [30] have been published in PLoS One on Aug 29, 2013 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23990929). Their work is perfect! However, when we compared our meta-analysis to theirs, we found there were three major differences/advantages of our meta-analysis. First, the deadline of search of theirs was March, 2013 and yielded eight case-control studies and one cross-sectional study; however, the deadline of search in our meta-analysis was January 30, 2013 and yielded 10 articles involving 11 case-control studies and one cohort study. Obviously, our search is more comprehensive. Second, we performed meta-analysis based on the number of lost tooth (Table 3); however, they pooled all studies together and ignored the influence of difference number lost tooth, which may biased the results. Third, our meta-analysis conducted a simulative dose-response effect analysis based on the number of lost tooth; this may provide more reference information than their meta-analysis. However, our study also has some limitations. First, the definition of the reference group and tooth loss used among studies varied, and the former might be the source of heterogeneity. No international unification index of evaluating tooth loss for relevant studies is available, which caused heterogeneity, and increased the difficulty performing the meta-analysis, and even resulted in the failure of the criteria for the meta-analysis. Second, heterogeneity was detected. Although heterogeneity between studies is very common in the meta-analysis of observational studies, we did not ignore it. We performed subgroup analyses to verify the heterogeneity, but it was still observed. Third, we were unable to investigate the histopathological subtypes because only 3 studies [26,27,28] clearly reported that the type of cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, whereas others are mixed. Finally, the results are significantly inconsistent based on the subgroups analyses and the statistical power was limited because of a relatively small number of major included studies. Four, the examination of tooth loss and HNC has not been the primary association of interest for many studies, and as a result, adjustment for other ‘proximal’ variables such as caries, periodontitis, alcoholic mouthwash use, or reason for extractions/tooth loss is rarely/never done. Therefore, the facticity of results might be influenced by this. Implications for Further Research Based on the results our meta-analysis, several questions arise. First, in routine clinical work, we found the oral health of patients who undergo HNC are more severe; hence, the association of tooth loss with HNC might or might not be causal. A prospective cohort study design with enough follow-up time and adequate control for confounding factors is needed to answer this question. Second, tooth loss is not acceptable and can potentially influence future demand for treatment [31]. Thus, patients should seek treatment if they lose their teeth. Obviously, individuals in developed countries can obtain more convenient and better oral healthcare. Therefore, is there a difference between developed and developing countries because of the social economic differences? Thus, studies should perform stratified analysis based on social economics and should respectively report the results. Third, what are the exact mechanisms in which tooth loss independently increase the risk of HNC? To answer this question, we suggest that experimental studies be conducted. Fourth, is there a dose-response effect between tooth loss and HNC risk? Although our study indicated that dose-response effects exist, the numbers of lost teeth overlapped with one another. Therefore, further studies should answer this question with sequential or without repeated numbers, and they should explore the critical value numbers. Finally, could preventing or treating tooth loss decrease the risk of HNC? Well-designed clinical trials, especially randomized controlled trials, are suggested to answer this question. Finally, we suggest further relevant studies can take tooth loss as the primary interesting. Conclusions This meta-analysis indicates that tooth loss is probably a significant and dependent risk factor of HNC, which may have a dose-response effect. People who lost six or more teeth should pay attention to symptoms of HNC, and losing 11 teeth or 15 teeth may be the threshold.",-,"1.

Association between tooth loss and orodigestive cancer mortality in an 80-year-old community-dwelling Japanese population: a 12-year prospective study,"Toshihiro Ansai, Yutaka Takata, Akihiro Yoshida, Inho Soh, Shuji Awano, Tomoko Hamasaki, Akira Sogame and Naoko Shimada","Background: A growing body of evidence has indicated a possible association between oral and gastrointestinal(aerodigestive) cancers and periodontal disease or tooth loss. However, the evidence remains contradictory. This study investigated whether tooth loss, which is indicative of poor oral health and a potential source of oral infections, is associated with death from aerodigestive cancer. Methods:The study included 656 subjects in Fukuoka prefecture, Japan, who were 80 years old at baseline in 1998. All subjects underwent oral clinical examination and answered a questionnaire to determine their background characteristics. Cause of death over the 12-year follow-up was recorded from the registers at the Public Health Centers and classified according to the WHO International Classification of Diseases. Statistical analysis of associations was performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox multivariate regression analyses. Results:A significant association was observed between tooth loss (continuous variable) and cancer death (hazard ratio (HR): 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00–1.07), after adjustment for potential confounders, including sex and smoking status. However, that association became insignificant in the fully adjusted model. On the other hand, tooth loss was significantly associated with aerodigestive cancer (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01–1.13), even in the fully adjusted model including place of residence as a part of socioeconomic status. Conclusions:This study provides the first evidence in a prospective study in a Japanese population that tooth loss is associated with increased orodigestive cancer mortality, although the causality remains unclear. Keywords:Dental care, Gastrointestinal cancer, Tooth loss","Background A link between oral health status and all-cause mortality has been proposed, and there is evidence of a possible association between periodontal disease and atherosclerotic vascular disease [1]. In contrast, evidence of a relationship between oral health and cancer mortality is inconsistent [2-6]. For example, Michaud et al. [6] reported an association between all kinds of cancer and oral health status, including tooth loss and periodontal disease, in a prospective cohort study, and reported a significant association between tooth loss and esophageal cancer, but not between tooth loss and stomach cancer. However, two studies from China found an association between tooth loss and gastric cancer [3,4]. Putative mechanisms involved in the association between tooth loss and aerodigestive cancers have been reviewed by Meurman and Bascones-Martinez [7], and infection and inflammation have been proposed as important risk factors. Aerodigestive cancers were defined as cancers in the oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, and colon, rectum or anus, as described in a recent report [8]. The association between poor oral health and increased risk of cancer at oral and pharyngeal sites was based on cross-sectional studies [9,10]. Thus, we aimed to perform a prospective study to examine the association between tooth loss and orodigestive cancer mortality in a cohort of elderly individuals from the general Japanese population over a 12-year period. Methods Study population The Fukuoka 8020 survey, conducted between 1998 and 2010, was designed to examine the association between oral and systemic health conditions of the community-dwelling population at nine locations in Fukuoka Prefecture, as described previously [11]. Those 9 locations were selected randomly from urban, suburban, and rural communities to achieve a balance of living environments in terms of socio-demographic backgrounds, dietary habits, health behaviors, and available medical care. This study was designed as an investigation of a representative population of individuals residing in the eastern area of Kyushu Island who were born in 1917. The percentage of 80-year-old individuals living in the study locations was approximately 0.62% of all residents, which was similar to the percentage (0.64%) of 80-year-old individuals residing in all of Kyushu. All procedures were approved by the Human Investigations Committee of Kyushu Dental College, and all subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation. Three with a history of cancer at baseline were excluded. Of the 1282 80-year-old subjects included, 697 (54.4%; 277 male, 420 female) agreed to participate in the present study and completed a medical questionnaire, and also underwent physical, laboratory blood, and oral examinations. The mean proportion of elderly subjects in the communities was 24%, which was slightly higher than that in the total Japanese population (23%). The participants were followed up for 12 years after the baseline examination, with 41 (5.9%) lost to follow-up. Oral and systemic examinations The baseline survey was performed in March 1998, and the participants took part in a personal interview performed by trained public health nurses, and answered a questionnaire containing 37 questions about oral and systemic health status, use of medical (or dental) services, personal hygiene, healthcare practices (including smoking habit), and medical conditions, as described before [11]. Dental health conditions including number of teeth were also examined by three dentists with comparable skills, as previously described [11]. Briefly, the examiners performed all oral examinations using criteria recommended by the World Health Organization [12]. To confirm inter-examiner reliability, duplicate examinations were conducted, and the agreement for dental health conditions (dental caries, missing, filling) was 92%. Endpoint ascertainment Follow-up of the cohort was from the date of the baseline examination (in 1998) until June, 2010. Information on the survival of the subjects was collected from the registers at the Public Health Centers of each district included in the study, with cancer deaths coded by the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision. Statistical analysis Power analysis was performed using the software package G-Power. The statistical power of this study was found to be 86.9%, with sample sizes of 242 (alive during 12-year) for n1 and 414 (died during 12-year) for n2, an effect size of 0.25, and an α value of 0.05 set (two tailed t-test). Associations between baseline demographic and health-related characteristics and oral health status were examined with the Student t-test and Chi-squared test. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality in relation to tooth loss and all deaths including cancer deaths. The quantitative variable (number of teeth) was converted into categorical variable (four groups): edentulous, 1–9 teeth, 10–19 teeth or 20 or more teeth, as described previously [13]. HRs were adjusted for sex and smoking status (never, past, current), and additionally for body mass index (BMI), fasting serum glucose, total cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure. Comparisons of the survival rates among 4 groups based on number of teeth were also assessed by the method of Kaplan and Meier, followed by a log-rank test to assess the significance between survival curves. Statistical significance was indicated by two-sided P < 0.05. All statistical analyzes were performed using SPSS ver. 19 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Results Of the 697 participants originally examined, 41 subjects (5.8%) had moved away during the 12 years, giving a follow-up rate of 94.2%. Of the remaining 656 participants, 414 (63.1%) had died by the end of follow-up in 2010. There were 71 deaths due to cancer, including lung cancer (n = 16), stomach cancer (n = 12), liver cancer (n = 13), colon cancer (n = 6), kidney and bladder cancer (n = 5), pancreatic cancer (n = 4), uterine cancer (n = 4), oropharyngeal cancer (n = 1), esophageal cancer (n = 1), ovarian cancer (n = 1), and other cancers (n = 11). Therefore, as described above, there were 37 deaths due to aerodigestive cancer (19 males, 18 females). Demographic data and risk indicators at baseline in 1998 are presented in Table 1. Significantly more women than men were alive at the end of the study. Compared with survivors, subjects who died were more likely to be smokers (P < 0.001) and to be less physically active (P < 0.001). Both groups were similar regarding marital status, alcohol drinking habit, and self-rated health status. Mean BMI, total cholesterol, serum albumin, and fasting blood glucose, but not systolic blood pressure, were significantly lower at baseline in subjects who died than in survivors. There was a significantly higher number of missing teeth or proportion edentulous in those who died versus those who survived, indicating a poorer dental status in the subjects who died. Also, a significantly higher proportion of those who died were edentate. The survival curves of subjects who had not died due to aerodigestive cancer during the 12-year follow-up period in the four groups divided by the number of remaining teeth in all subjects, as well as by sex are presented in Figure 1. The survival rate of all subjects was lowest in the edentulous subjects, though there was no significant difference among the four teeth groups (Figure 1A). As illustrated in Figure 1B, the survival rate for males was also lowest in the 1–9 teeth group, though there was no significant difference among the four teeth groups. In contrast, the survival rate for females was lowest in the edentulous groups, being significantly lower than that in the group with 20 teeth or more teeth (χ2 = 3.93, P = 0.047). Thus, a stronger association was found in females. In multivariate Cox regression analyses, significant associations were observed between tooth loss (continuous variable) and all-cause mortality and cancer mortality (HR: 1.018, 95% CI: 1.005–1.03; HR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00–1.07, respectively), with adjustment for sex and smoking status. No significant associations of cardiovascular or pneumonia death and tooth loss were observed in the final model (HR: 1.018, 95% CI: 0.99–1.04; HR: 0.994, 95% CI: 0.97–1.02, respectively) (Table 2). Tooth loss was marginally significantly associated with stomach cancer (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.98–1.22), and was significantly associated with orodigestive cancer (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02–1.13) with adjustment for sex and smoking status. Also, the observed association between tooth loss and orodigestive cancer remained significant (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02–1.13), even with full adjustment (sex, smoking status, BMI, fasting serum glucose, total cholesterol, serum albumin, physical activity) (Model 2 in Table 2). Furthermore, those associations remained significant (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.13), when place of residence as a part of socioeconomic status was added in the final model (Model 3 in Table 2). Subjects with tooth loss had no significant risk of lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and liver cancer, after extended adjustment in the final model (HR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.96–1.10; HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.83–1.11; HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.92–1.18; HR:1.07, 95% CI: 0.98–1.17, respectively). Discussion In this prospective study of a cohort of 80-year-old Japanese subjects, we have shown that number of teeth lost might be an independent predictor of both all-cause and cancer mortality. Even after extensive adjustment for recognized confounders, tooth loss was significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cancer mortality, but not of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and pneumonia mortality. Interestingly, when we further assessed the association between tooth loss and site-specific cancer mortality, there were significant associations between tooth loss and aerodigestive cancers, but not between tooth loss and lung cancer. To our knowledge, previous longitudinal studies investigating the association between tooth loss and orodigestive cancer are limited to reports by three groups: Stolzenberg- Solomon et al. [2], Abnet et al. [3,4], and Michaud et al. [6]. The only investigation in an Asian population was by Abnet et al. [3]. Our study is the second Asian study and the first in a Japanese population, although a previous case–control study in 5,000 outpatients of a Japanese Cancer Center reported a positive association between tooth loss and the risk of head and neck, esophageal, and lung cancer [14]. In the study of Abnet et al. [3,4], there were two critical issues: 1) tooth loss was set as a dichotomous variable based on the median for the cohort, namely six teeth; and 2) only upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancers were investigated. In their study, upper GI cancer was defined as esophageal, gastric cardia, and non-cardia gastric cancers. In their report, tooth loss was significantly associated with increased risk of death from upper GI cancer (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.14–1.59). Also, the risk of upper GI cancer associated with tooth loss was higher in male never-smokers than in male smokers (HR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.03–2.45; HR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.06–1.83, respectively). Results of multivariate analyses in a study in the United States [6] found no significant associations between tooth loss and morbidity due to stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, or colorectal cancer (HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.56–2.16; HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.56–1.47; HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.87–1.37, respectively). However, in another study by the same researchers, a significant association between tooth loss and pancreatic cancer morbidity was observed (HR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.13–2.31) [15]. In another Western country, Finland, there was a significant association between tooth loss and pancreas cancer morbidity (HR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.09–2.46) [2]. Thus, these studies have reported conflicting results for the association between tooth loss and cancer morbidity or mortality. On the other hand, we found no significant association between tooth loss and CVD mortality, which is inconsistent with the recent other study, as reported by Watt et al. [16]. This difference may be due to the difference in subject age (the mean age of their study was approximately 50 years old in that study). One of the possible reasons underlying the different outcomes could be because of differences in the criteria used for measuring tooth loss. In most cases, a dichotomous variable was used. For example, Stolzenberg-Solomon et al. [2] used two categories, edentulism vs. 0–10 missing teeth, while Michaud et al. [6] used three categories of 0–16, 17–24, and 25–32 teeth. Those results indicate that cut-off values for number of teeth utilized there have not been standardized. Because of this disparity, we employed the number of missing teeth as a continuous variable in the present study, as it basically represents an accumulated burden of severe periodontal disease as the number increases. However, the association might not always be linear, as the association between CVD mortality and the number of missing teeth was shown to be non-linear in the study of Tu et al. [5]. A similar situation has been also been found in periodontal disease assessments. Periodontal disease is generally diagnosed by probing and its diagnosis of periodontal disease is not straightforward, thus it would be inappropriate to use for determination of the underlying disease status. As pointed out by Tu and Gilthorpe [17], an alternative method is to use the number of lost teeth, as tooth loss appears to be a better indicator than probing as a marker of lifetime oral health, and is less prone to measurement error. International standardization regarding evaluation by tooth loss or periodontal disease is required. There are several limitations in the present study. First, the sample consisted largely of generally healthy elderly subjects, who might have been more eager and/ or able to participate. Thus, our findings may indicate an association only in generally healthy elderly subjects. Second, our subjects in this study were all 80 years old at baseline, which is a very elderly population. It is possible that the mortality rates for both total and specific cancers could be underestimated because of a survivor effect. Thus, future investigations in a younger population will be necessary to confirm the validity of our results. Third, evaluation of the mortality risk for specific cancers was limited because of the small number of site-specific aerodigestive cancer deaths. Conclusions The results of this study showed a significant positive association between tooth loss and orodigestive cancer mortality risk, although the causal relationship remains unclear.",-,"1.

Teeth Loss and Risk of Cancer at 14 Common Sites in Japanese,"Akio Hiraki, Keitaro Matsuo, Takeshi Suzuki, Takakazu Kawase, and Kazuo Tajima","Background: Tooth loss has been associated with higher risk of several types of cancer. To clarify the significance of tooth loss to the risk of 14 common cancers, we conducted a large-scale, case-control study based on the Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center.Methods:A total of 5,240 cancer subjects and 10,480 age-and sex-matched noncancer controls were recruited.Patients with 14 types of cancer newly diagnosed from 2000 to 2005 were eligible as case subjects, and new patients without cancer in the same time period were eligible as controls. Tooth loss was categorized into four groups: group 1, number of remaining teeth,z21; group 2, 9 to 20; group 3, 1 to 8; and group 4, 0. The Effect of tooth loss was assessed as odds ratios (OR)with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) calculated with conditional logistic regression models, with adjustment for potential confounders.Results:A decreased number of remaining teeth was associated with increased OR of head and neck (OR,1.68; 95% CI, 0.88-1.93;Ptrend= 0.055), esophageal(OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.17-4.75;Ptrend= 0.002), and lung(OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.05-2.27;Ptrend= 0.027) cancers.Conclusions:We showed a significant positive association between tooth loss and the risk of head and neck,esophageal, and lung cancers after adjustment for potential confounding factors. The findings indicate that preventive efforts aimed at the preservation of teeth may decrease the risk of these cancers.(Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2008;17(5):1222–7)","Introduction The oral cavity provides a gateway between the external environment and the gastrointestinal tract and acts in both food ingestion and digestion. Oral hygiene potentially affects gastrointestinal flora and nutritional status and may thus have implications for the development of chronic disease. Among the elderly, tooth loss, a persistent health problem that is caused mainly by periodontitis, develops over many years through the spread of bacterial infection and inflammation of the gum to the ligaments and bone that support the teeth (1).The potential role of periodontal disease in chronic disease has been highlighted by recent epidemiologic findings of an association with the risk of ischemic heart disease (2, 3) and stroke (4). Periodontal disease has also been associated with an increased risk of cancer at several sites. Several studies have associated oral cancer with both tooth loss and poor oral hygiene independent of age, tobacco consumption, and alcohol consumption(5-7). Tooth loss has also been reported to be associated with a higher risk of esophageal (8, 9), gastric (9, 10), and pancreatic (11, 12) cancers. However, most of these studies have been conducted in western populations, and evidence from Asian populations is scarce.Here, we comprehensively examined the relationship between tooth loss and the risk of 14 types of cancers in a large-scale, case-control study involving 5,240 Japanese Cancer patients and 10,480 age- and sex-matched non-cancer controls.Materials and Methods Study Subjects.Cases and controls were selected from the database of the Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center, conducted at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital. Details of the Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center have been described elsewhere (13, 14). Briefly,patients were enrolled between January 2001 and November 2005. Information on lifestyle factors as well as other relevant factors, including the number of teeth lost, was collected from first-visit outpatients ages 18 to 79 years using a self-administered questionnaire. All Exposures were measured with a self-administered questionnaire given at the time of first visit to our hospital and subsequently again before any diagnostic procedures were conducted. The number of teeth lost was determined by the question, ‘‘How many teeth do you have remaining?’’ and responses were categorized into four groups: group 1, number of remaining teeth,z21; group 2, 9 to 20; group 3, 1 to 8; and group 4, 0.Responses were checked by trained interviewers. Each Patient was asked for information when healthy or before the current symptoms developed.The rationale for the use of noncancer outpatients at our hospital as controls for epidemiologic studies to evaluate cancer risk factors is as follows. Like most general hospitals in Japan, Aichi Cancer Center accepts new patients who visit at their own discretion, with or without a doctor’s referral, and although called a cancer hospital, only 19% of all new outpatients have cancer(15). Among non cancer outpatients, 45% present with no abnormal findings on clinical examination and 35% with benign non specific diseases. Our previous study showed that the lifestyle patterns of first-visit outpatients ‘‘agree’’with those in a randomly selected sample of the general population of Nagoya City (16). The questionnaire data were loaded into the Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center database and periodically linked with the hospital-based cancer registry system to update the data on cancer incidence.The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee at Aichi Cancer Center.In the present study, patients ages 20 to 79 years with any of 14 types of incident cancer newly diagnosed from January 2001 to the end of 2005 were deemed eligible as case subjects. The 14 common cancers were defined according to the following codes of theInternationals Classification of Diseases,Tenth Edition and Related Health Problems: head and neck (C00-06, 10-14,30-32), esophagus (C15), stomach (C16), colorectum(C18-20), liver (C22), pancreas (C25), lung (C34), breast(C50), uterus (C53-55), ovary (C56), prostate (C61),bladder (C67), thyroid (C73), and lymphoma (C81-85).A total of 5,240 cancer patients with no prior history of cancer were enrolled. The controls were randomly selected from the 22,124 first-visit outpatients at AichiCancer Center Hospital enrolled during the same periodin Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program atAichiCancerCenterandconfirmedondiagnosticinvestigation to have no cancer or history of neoplasia.Two age (F3 years)– and sex-matched controls were assigned to each case.Consumption of Tobacco and Alcohol.Smoking habit was entered under the three categories of never, former,and current. Cumulative smoking dose was evaluated as pack-years, the product of the number of packs consumed per day and years of smoking. Former Smokers and drinkers were defined as those who quit smoking at least 1 year before the survey.Assessment of Vegetable and Fruit Intake.Consumption of food items, green-yellow vegetables, other vegetables, and fruits were based on the semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire, described elsewhere(17, 18), which consists of 47 single food items with frequencies in the eight categories of never or seldom, oneto three times a month, one to two times a week, three to four times a week, five to six times a week, once a day,twice a day, and three or more times a day. Values for the consumption of these three food groups were calculated the sums of consumption of contributing single food items as estimated from the food composition table, food frequency, and portion size. The food frequency questionnaire was validated by referring to a 3-day weighed dietary record as standard, which confirmed acceptable reproducibility and validity (19, 20).Statistical Analyses.We assessed the effect of tooth loss on the risk of cancer in terms of odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) as estimated by conditional logistic models adjusted for potential confounders. Potential confounders considered in the multivariate analyses were age, sex, smoking and drinking status (never, former, current), vegetable and fruit intake, body mass index (BMI; body weight/height 2), and regular exercise (yes, no). Dietary intake was categorized into first, second, and third quartiles of intake among controls. Missing values for covariates were treated as a dummy variable and included in themodels. Effect modifications were assessed by interaction terms between number of remaining teeth and sex, age,smoking status, or pack-years. Differences in categorized demographic variables between cases and controls were tested by them 2test. Mean values for age and total dietary intake were compared between cases and controls by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.P< 0.05 was used for statistical significance. All analyses were done using STATA version 8 (Stata).Results Table 1 summarizes subject characteristics for the 14 common cancer sites and controls. A total of 5,240 casesand 10,480 age- and sex-matched controls were included.The proportion of current smokers and drinkers was higher in the subjects than in the controls. The proportion of current drinking tended to be higher in the subjects.The control group had a greater green-yellow vegetable intake than the case group, but no difference was seen in the amount of intake of other vegetables and fruits. The Percentage of subjects undertaking regular exercise was‘‘lower’’ in the control group.Table 2 shows the association between tooth loss and the risk of cancer for 14 common site cancers.A decreased number of remaining teeth (increased number of teeth lost: number of remaining teeth, 0)was associated with increased OR of having head and neck (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.88-1.93;Ptrend=0.055),esophagus (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.17-4.75;Ptrend= 0.002),and lung (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.05-2.27;Ptrend= 0.027)cancers compared with a preserved number of remaining teeth (number of remaining teeth,z21). In contrast, decreased number of teeth remaining was also associated with lower OR for prostate cancer of 0.49 (95% CI,0.19-1.26;P= 0.049). Drinking status had the biggest effect in pushing this association away from the null.In view of the association of tooth loss with age,age-stratified analyses were conducted for head and neck, esophagus, lung, and prostate cancers (Table 3). Forehead and neck and esophageal cancers, clear associations between tooth loss and cancer risk were seen in the younger group (<70 years old; head and neck cancer OR,2.98; 95% CI, 1.17-7.60;Ptrend= 0.050; esophageal cancer, 4.43; 95% CI, 1.68-12.79;Ptrend= 0.002; lung cancer, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.14-3.38;Ptrend= 0.166). Associations Were less clear in the older group (z70 years old; head and neck cancer OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 0.95-6.53;Ptrend=0.079; esophageal cancer; OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.45-6.16;Ptrend= 0.235).Table 4 shows ORs for head and neck, esophageal, and lung cancers stratified by sex. In head and neck cancer, a positive association between tooth loss and OR was seen in women (OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.49-7.95;Ptrend= 0.007) but not in men (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.74-1.76;Ptrend= 0.433). Esophageal cancer, a positive association was seen in bothsexes but was stronger in women (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.19-17.95;Ptrend= 0.023) than men (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.04-2.62;Ptrend= 0.049). For lung cancer, in contrast, no association was evident in either sex. A statistically significant interaction between the number of remaining teeth and sex was evident in esophagus cancer (P= 0.023).The effect of confounding by smoking habits was further evaluated in stratified analyses. The association of smoking with tooth loss is well known (21). Given that smoking status (never, former, current) and pack-years also affect the risk of various types of cancers, we stratified by smoking status and pack-years. Table 5 shows ORs for head and neck, esophageal, and lung cancers stratified by status and pack-years. PositiveassociationsbetweentoothlossandORsinneversmokers (pack-years = 0) were seen for both head and neck (OR, 4.24; 95% CI, 1.56-11.49;Ptrend= 0.008) and esophageal (OR, 9.50; 95% CI, 1.33-67.98;Ptrend= 0.021)cancers but not in former or current smokers. In contrast,the association was obvious in current smokers for lung cancer. Statistically significant interactions between number of remaining teeth and pack-years were evident in head and neck cancer (P= 0.030).Discussion Our case-control study shows that greater teeth loss was associated with an increased risk of head and neck,esophageal, and lung cancers and a decreased risk of prostate cancer. For head and neck and esophageal cancers, stratified analyses by sex or age showed clear associations between tooth loss and cancer risk in women and younger subjects but less clear associations in men and older subjects. In addition, this association was strongly observed in never smokers and never/former drinkers.To date, associations with tooth loss have been reported for the risk of oral, esophageal, gastric, and pancreas cancers (5-12) but not for lung or prostate cancer. Our findings for head and neck and esophageal cancers are consistent with these previous epidemiologic studies. In contrast, we found no association with the risk of gastric or pancreatic cancer as was also observed in two different cohorts study (10, 12). In addition, no previous study has reported a positive association with the risk of lung cancer or an inverse association with that of prostate cancer, although Hujoel et al.reported a positive association between periodontitis and lung cancer mortality (22). Our results therefore strengthen the evidence for an association with head and neck and esophageal cancers. The apparently discrepant results for other cancer sites require furtherclarification.One of the central questions in previous publications examining tooth loss as a risk factor for cancer was whether residual confounding by smoking could explain significant associations. In the present study, analysis stratified by smoking status clearly showed a significant association between tooth loss and the risk of head and neck and esophageal cancers in never smokers. This Finding strengthens the association between tooth loss and cancer risk observed in conventional analyses.Michaud et al. also reported a significant association between tooth loss and the risk of pancreatic cancers in never smokers (12). However, other studies did not stratify by smoking status but did include smoking status in their models (e.g., pack-years or simply never, past, orcurrent smoking).Several mechanisms behind the association have been hypothesized. First, tooth loss is a common consequence of chronic bacterial infections, such as periodontitis (1).It may therefore serve as a surrogate for chronic infection and inflammation, which in turn may be important in the pathogenesis of cancer (23). Of interest,this mechanism may in particular support the associations with head and neck and esophageal cancers. In Addition, the host response to periodontal disease may lead to systemic exposure to proinflammatory cytokines. In this way, periodontal disease may increase the risk of lung cancer through the chronic release of inflammatory mediators. Second, periodontal disease may influence carcinogenesis through the increased generation of carcinogens, specifically nitrosamines.Individuals with periodontal disease and poor oral hygiene have considerably elevated levels of oral bacteria and markedly higher nitrosamine levels in their oral cavity due to the presence of nitrate-reducing bacteria (24). Poor oral hygiene and the attendant increased loss of teeth might result in greater endogenous nitrosamine production and therefore a greater risk of these cancers. However, the possibility that tooth loss in our analyses merely reflects unhealthful behaviors cannot be ruled out. Third, tooth loss reduces masticatory ability and may hence lead to the consumption of aless healthy diet, which could be associated with cancer(25-27). Reduction of masticatory ability also may result in the deglutition of larger pieces of food, leading to mechanical injuries of the mucous membrane in the oral cavity or esophagus.A second interesting finding was the negative association between tooth loss and the risk of prostate cancer.Interpretation of this association is difficult. Several Epidemiologic studies have shown a negative association between socioeconomic status and the risk of prostate cancer (28). Tooth loss is an indicator of poor oral hygiene, which may be associated with socioeconomic status. We speculate that this might be one reason for this inverse association. However, as we had no information on socioeconomic status in the current study, further study to clarify this point is warranted.Several potential limitations of this study should be considered. First, the number of teeth remaining was examined after the occurrence of cancer. Although it is unlikely that the occurrence itself caused tooth loss, this limitation should nevertheless be considered when interpreting the results.Second, recall bias is possible; because data regarding the number of remaining teeth were obtained from self-reported questionnaire rather than oral examination,measurement error in reporting is possible. The difficulty in evaluating the accuracy of this self-reporting means that the possibility of misclassification cannot be excluded. In this regard, however, Douglass et al. reported a strong correlation between the self-reported number of teeth and the actual number determined on clinical examination (r= 0.97; ref. 29), and we therefore assumed that self-reporting had no adverse effect on our results.Nevertheless, this study was from a completely different population and might therefore not apply to our present Japanese population.Third, residual confounding by smoking may be a major limitation. Although we adjusted for common confounders, including age, sex, smoking and drinking status (never, former, current), vegetable and fruit intake,BMI, and regular exercise, we cannot rule out residual confounding by smoking to explain the association we identified with lung cancer. Interestingly, the association between tooth loss and the risk of head and neck and esophageal cancers was obvious in never smokers. In Contrast, this trend was not observed in lung cancer. The Reason for this discrepancy is unclear. The strong association between smoking and both tooth loss and the risk of lung cancer is well known. Although smoking status was adjusted for as a potential confounder, the effect of smoking status might not have been excluded in the analyses, especially in lung cancer. The lack of information on the type of tobacco used (e.g., cigar, pipe,or chewing) may also be a problem. In addition, we could not adjust for other confounders, including infection with human papillomavirus, which increases the risk of head and neck cancers, or education. This is also a major limitation and a possible explanation for the positive findings. Further study to clarify this point is needed.Fourth, a methodological issue with the selection of the control base population remains. We used non cancer patients at our hospital as controls, given the likelihood that our cases arose within this population base.Moreover, earlier comparisons of lifestyle characteristics confirmed no substantial difference between these out-patients in our hospital and individuals randomly selected from the general population (16). The medical background of controls is another potential source of bias;however, our previous study, which focused on a female population, showed only a limited effect for this variable,and little difference would be expected for males.In conclusion, our study has shown significant positive associations between tooth loss and the risk of head and neck, esophageal, and lung cancers, although the effect of smoking status might not have been sufficiently excluded, especially with regard to lung cancer. Our results suggest that the maintenance of tooth number, especially before older age, might prevent these cancers. These findings indicate that preventive efforts aimed at the preservation of teeth may decrease the risk of these cancers.

Dawsey 2, Farin Kamangar, and Christian C. Abnet","Introduction: Poor oral health and tooth loss have been proposed as possible risk factors for some chronic diseases, including gastric cancer. However only a small number of studies have tested these associations. Method: We conducted a case-control study in Golestan Province, Iran, that enrolled 309 cases diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma (118 non cardia, 161 cardia, and 30 mixed-locations) and 613 sex, age and neighborhood matched controls. Data on oral health were obtained through physical examination and questionnaire including tooth loss, the number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth, and frequency of tooth brushing. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals(95% CIs) were obtained using conditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Standard one degree-of-freedom linear trend test and a multiple degree of freedom global test of the effect of adding oral hygiene variables to the model were also calculated. Results: Our results showed apparent associations between tooth loss and DMFT score with risk of gastric cancer, overall and at each anatomic subsite. However, these associations were not monotonic and were strongly confounded by age. The results also showed that subjects who brushed their teeth less than daily were at significantly higher risk for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma OR (95% CI) of 5.6 (1.6–19.3). Discussion: We found evidence for an association between oral health and gastric cancer, but the non- monotonic association, the relatively strong effect of confounder adjustment, and inconsistent results across studies must temper the strength of any conclusions. Keywords: Adenocarcinoma; Tooth loss; Oral health; Stomach","Introduction Although gastric cancer is still the fourth most common cancer in the world by incidence, its rates have substantially declined over the past century (1). Declines in gastric cancer incidence have been attributed to changes in a number of environmental risk factors. A reduction in the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection (2–6) is probably the main factor in lower rates of gastric cancer, but dietary changes (7, 8) may also be contributing to this decline. Poor oral health is another possible risk factor for gastric cancer. Some recent epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an association between poor oral health or hygiene and cancers of different organs, including cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx (9), esophagus (10–12), pancreas (13, 14), kidney (15), and lung (16), and also with other chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (17) and diabetes (18). At least two previous studies have also examined the association between poor oral health and gastric cancer, overall and by its anatomic subtypes, i.e., cardiac and noncardiac (11, 19). Although H. pylori in the stomach has not been shown to correlate with oral health, H. pylori infection in the mouth may act as a reservoir for stomach reinfection (20). If poor oral health is established as a risk factor for gastric cancer, it may explain part of the decline in rates over the past century, because oral health has improved through time in most populations with improved economic conditions. Here we use data from a case-control study in Golestan Province, in northeastern Iran, to investigate the association between oral health and oral hygiene and the risk of gastric cancer, overall and by its anatomic subtypes. Methods Case and control selection Case and control selection has been explained in detail elsewhere (21). Cases were recruited from December 2004 to December 2011 at A Trak Clinic, located in Gonbad City, in the eastern part of Golestan Province, Iran. Subjects with histologically proven gastric cancer who were referred or were diagnosed at A Trak clinic, the only specialized referral clinic for upper GI problems in the area, were invited to enroll as cases in the study. Controls were selected from healthy subjects who enrolled in the Golestan Cohort Study (22). This cohort study recruited its participants from January 2004 to June 2008 in eastern Golestan Province. In total, 50,045 apparently healthy subjects, aged 40–75 years where enrolled. From this pool of cohort study participants, we randomly selected two controls matched to each case by age (±5 years), sex, and urban/rural residence status. We could not find matched controls for some of the cases; therefore these cases were excluded (N=22). For some cases since the first set of controls did not have serum samples we selected other controls while we also kept the previously selected controls. 309 cases were selected from which 22 had one control assigned, 276 had two controls assigned, 5 had three controls assigned and 6 had four controls assigned. By comparing our included subjects to the Golestan Cancer Registry we found that we captured 60% of the gastric cancer cases in this geographic region. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Digestive Diseases Research Institute of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, and all participating individuals provided written informed consent. Questionnaires and physical examination All participants completed a general lifestyle questionnaire, had a brief physical exam, and provided blood samples. A general questionnaire was used to obtain detailed information on age, sex, ethnicity, place of residence, education, and ownership of property, cars, and appliances (as indicators of socioeconomic status), personal and family history of cancer, and lifelong history of opium and tobacco use. Height and weight were directly measured. All subjects also completed a food frequency questionnaire that was developed and validated for use in Golestan Province (23). Oral hygiene and dentition data Data on oral health were obtained during the physical exam by dentist-trained health personnel. The number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth was recorded and we used the number of teeth lost or summed DMFT score as exposure variables. Interviewers also asked about the frequency of toothbrushing and use of dentures. Repeatability of DMFT counts were checked two months later in 130 subjects, with 88.3% agreement and a kappa of 0.86 (24). Helicobacter pylori antibody assays Serum and plasma samples from cases and controls, respectively, were used to perform H. pylori antibody assays. A multiplex serology method was used to assay the serostatus of 15 antibodies against H. pylori proteins (25). H. pylori positivity in this analysis was defined based on the result of the Cag A antibody from this assay. Statistical Analysis We used conditional logistic regression models to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence Intervals (CIs). All models were conditioned on the matching factors, while adjusted models included variables for age, education, ethnicity, wealth score, total daily fruit intake, total daily vegetable intake, tobacco use, opium use, and denture use. We also tested adjustment for antibodies to H. pylori CagA antigen. H pylori infection is very common in this population (26) and 84% of the cases and 82% of the controls in our study were positive for Cag A antibody. Adjustment for antibodies to H. pylori CagA antigen did not change the results, so it was not added in our final models. The wealth score was created using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) with data on ownership of automobiles, motorcycles, televisions, refrigerators, freezers, vacuums, and washing machines, as well as house ownership, house size, the presence on an indoor bath, and the occupation of the head of the family. The methods for creating this score and it association with cancer risk have been previously published (27). Regular opium and tobacco use were defined as having used these substances at least once a week for a minimum of 6 months. We categorized our primary exposures, tooth loss and frequency of brushing as previously described (10). We used two different overall tests of the hypothesis that the tooth loss or oral hygiene variables were associated with gastric cancer because the categorical risk estimates did not appear to show a linear trend. We used both a standard one degree-of-freedom linear trend test (assigning each category an ordinal number) and a multiple degree of freedom global test of the effect of adding oral hygiene variables to the model, which avoids an assumption of linearity. Results Of the 309 gastric adenocarcinoma cases, 161 (52%) and 118 (38%) were cardiac and non cardia cancer respectively. For the other 30 cases, we could not define the origin of the tumor, so they were classified only as gastric adenocarcinomas. Table 1 presents a summary of the demographic and food variables, and the tobacco and opium use of the cases and controls. Cases and controls were well matched for gender and urban/rural residence. Controls were more likely to be of Turkmen ethnicity and to have some education than cases. The prevalence of opium use was higher in cases than in controls (P-value <0.0001). The global and trend p-values show some evidence for an association between tooth loss and DMFT score with risk of gastric cancer, overall and at each anatomic subsite (Table 2). Comparing the unadjusted and adjusted models, the fully adjusted estimates showed several large changes. Age was the main confounding factor that caused these changes, while the other factors had minimal effect. We used two overall tests of association, a global test which assumes nonlinear effect and a linear trend test. These two tests did not always produce similar results. Table 2 also shows the associations between frequency of tooth brushing and gastric cancer risk. There was a significant association only for gastric cardia cancer, for which subjects who brushed their teeth less than daily were at significantly higher risk. This association was apparent in the crude models and strengthened in the fully adjust models. Discussion We found that tooth loss and oral hygiene were associated with differing risks of gastric adenocarcinoma in this population. The nonlinear nature of the associations and the appreciable changes in odds ratios after adjusting for confounders suggest that these associations may be due to residual confounding. The association between oral health, tooth loss and gastric cancer has been investigated in a limited number of studies (11, 15, 19, 28–32). Two of these studies failed to find a significant effect of oral health on gastric cancer risk (15, 28), while the others reported an increase in the risk of gastric cancer in subjects with poor oral hygiene. Among the previous studies, the strongest association was reported for non-cardia gastric cancer, while in the same study they found no association between tooth loss and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (19). Recently two review articles have investigated the relationship between tooth loss, periodontal disease and cancer in different organs (33, 34). Using available published data, neither of them could conclude the existence of an association between oral health parameters and gastric cancer. This lack of consistency among studies may be related to methodological differences in the criteria used to define periodontal disease and oral health, differences in study populations, difficulties in distinguishing gastric cardia and non cardia cancers, differences in risk factors in high and low incidence areas, or chance findings (type I error). There are several mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the possible association between oral health and cancer. The association between periodontal disease and oral and upper GI tract cancers may be related to the local activation of carcinogens in alcohol, tobacco, or the diet, such as acetaldehyde (35) or nitrosamines (11). Poor oral health can increase the production of these products (36). The use of oral antiseptics (e.g. chlorhexidine) decreases salivary nitrosation (37) and may also reduce production of other metabolites. A case-control study from China showed that regular tooth brushing reduced the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)(38). In another study from Iran, significant associations were found between the DMFT score and lack of daily tooth brushing and ESCC (10). Constant irritation of oral mucosa by improperly fitted dentures and irritation of the mucosa of the upper GI tract by inappropriately chewed food, caused by tooth loss, have been proposed as other possible mechanisms (39). Alterations of dietary pattern, such as decreased fruits and vegetable intake secondary to tooth loss (40) may also predispose to oral and upper GI cancers. Alternatively, poor oral hygiene and altered oral microbiota may act on these or distant organs, like the stomach, pancreas or cardiovascular system, via increased systemic inflammation (33). Systemic markers of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, like endothelial function (41) and glucose control (42), have been improved after successful treatment of periodontal disease. Our study has several strengths and weaknesses. We captured more than half of the gastric cancer cases in this population and captured a wealth of information on potential confounders, allowing us to address the most likely sources of confounding. Potential limitations of this study included a lack of more detailed history of oral health and the lack of a direct periodontal exam, since tooth loss may be due to a variety of factors with different underlying disease processes. In conclusion, we found some evidence for an association between oral health and gastric cancer, but the non-linear association and relatively strong effect of confounder adjustment must temper the strengths of any conclusion. Our study adds to the relatively inconsistent literature on this topic and there is insufficient evidence for a clear pattern of association between oral health and the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma. Additional studies with more detailed oral health data and assessment of the oral microbiome (43) may provide more clarity.",-,"1. Jemal A, Bray F, Center MM, Ferlay J, Ward E, Forman D.

Cognitive function and 10 year mortality in an 85 year-old community-dwelling population,"Yutaka Takata, Toshihiro Ansai, Inho soh, shuji Awano, Ikuo nakamichi, sumio Akifusa, Kenichi goto, Akihiro Yoshida, hiroki Fujii, ritsuko Fujisawa, Kazuo sonoki","The relationship between mortality and impaired cognitive function has not been thoroughly investigated in a very elderly community-dwelling population, and little is known about the association of disease-specific mortality with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) subscale scores. Here we evaluated these data in Japanese community-dwelling elderly. In 2003, 85 year-olds (n=207) were enrolled; 205 completed the MMSE for cognitive function and were followed-up for 10 years, during which time 120 participants died, 70 survived, and 17 were lost to follow-up. Thirty-eight deaths were due to cardiovascular disease, 22 to senility, 21 to respiratory disease, and 16 to cancer. All-cause mortality decreased by 4.3% with a 1-point increase in the global MMSE score without adjustment, and it decreased by 6.3% with adjustment for both sex and length of education. Cardiovascular mortality decreased by 7.6% and senility mortality decreased by 9.2% with a 1-point increase in the global MMSE score with adjustment for sex and education. No association was found between respiratory diseases or cancer mortality and global MMSE score. All-cause mortality also decreased with increases in MMSE subscale scores for time orientation, place orientation, delayed recall, naming objects, and listening and obeying. Cardiovascular mortality was also associated with the MMSE subscale of naming objects, and senility mortality was associated with the subscales of time orientation and place orientation. Thus, we found that impaired cognitive function determined by global MMSE score and some MMSE subscale scores were independent predictors of all-cause mortality or mortality due to cardiovascular disease or senility in 85 year-olds.Keywords:cognition, elderly, mortality, community-dwelling, MMSE","Introduction A systematic review of the literature regarding community-dwelling individuals aged 65 and over showed that the levels of cognitive impairment among these individuals were associated with an increased risk of mortality, and this association was found even for mild levels of impairment.1 A review focusing on the association of mild cognitive impairment with mortality, which included studies on population-based samples with persons aged 65 and over, found that the relative risk for participants with mild cognitive impairment varied from 1.0 to 1.9.2 Another review article focusing on the association between geriatric syndrome and survival found that elderly persons aged 65 to 74 with advanced dementia have a higher risk of mortality than elderly persons without dementia, but the difference between people with and without dementia in remaining life expectancy may be 1 year or less in the “old-old”, particularly 90 and over.3In a large multicenter study of a population aged 65 years and over, an association between cognition and survival was relatively uniform across three age groups (74 years, 75–84 years, and 85+ years), but no association was found in men aged 85+, because of the reduced life expectancy in that age group.4 In a population of nursing home residents with the mean age of 83.8 years, individuals with both severe frailty syndrome and severe cognitive impairment were less likely to survive, but neither frailty nor cognitive impairment when considered separately was associated with a higher mortality rate.5 These investigations thus suggest that there is an association between cognitive impairment and high mortality in the elderly, but this association seems weaker in very elderly individuals (aged 80+ years).Therefore, it is important to determine whether the association between cognitive function and mortality is still present in very elderly persons living in the community. To clarify this association in the very elderly, we conducted the present study to examine this issue in a community-dwelling population of 85 year-olds.Methods Our previous study was conducted with 827 participants who were 80 years old in 1998 (born in 1917) and resided in one of nine districts in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan: Bunzen City, Munakata City, Yukuhashi City, Tobata Ward of Kitakyushu City, Kanda Town, Katsuyama Town, Toyotsu Town, Tsuiki Town, and Shinyoshitomi Village. There were 1,282 residents aged 80 years in these districts, and of these 827 agreed to participate in the 1998 study. Of the 827 individuals, 410 declined to participate in the present study and 210 died in the following 5 years; the 207 remaining 85 year-olds in 2003 (90 males, 117 females) participated in the present study. We compared sex and mortality dif-ferences between participants and non-participants in this study. Men were more prevalent in participants (43.2%) than in non-participants (35.6%, P=0.031), and mortality during 12 year follow-up from 80 years to 92 years was 39.3% for the former, and 68.8% for the latter (P0.001). However, this difference between these groups may be attributed partly to the fact that individuals who died before they reached the age of 85 years could not participate in the study started at 85 years. These findings indicate that participants used in the present study were not representative of the original study population in supplementary analyses, but the representatives of more healthy individuals.Of the 207 participants, 205 (88 males, 117 females) completed the Japanese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as an assessment of cognitive function, administered by an experienced speech/language/hearing therapist or occupational therapist. The MMSE is a standardized evaluation of global cognitive function and is widely used in epidemiological studies.7–10 A full score on the MMSE is 30. The MMSE includes eleven test items: 1) time orientation (5 points); 2) place orientation (5 points); 3) registration of three words (3 points); 4) calculation: mentally subtracting seven iteratively from 100 (5 points); 5) delayed recall of the three words presented earlier (3 points); 6) naming objects (2 points); 7) repeating a sentence (1 point); 8) listening and obeying following a three-stage instruction (3 points); 9) reading and obeying following a message printed on a card (1 point); 10) writing a sentence (1 point), and 11) copying a figure on a sheet (1 point). One cognitive function expert participated in MMSE data collection. We did not assess interrater reliability. All of the present study participants were also asked to fill out a medical questionnaire which included questions about current smoking, alcohol consumption, years of education, and history of stroke. After the baseline examination in 2003, when all of the participants were 85 years old, the 207 participants were followed-up for 10 years. Confirmation of whether the individual was living or had died was obtained by asking the family via a telephone call or home visit. The causes of death were classified according to the tenth version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).11 The study was approved by the Human Investigations Committee of Kyushu Dental University, and was conducted in full accord with ethical principles, including the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2002. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with these principles.All of the data are reported as means ± standard deviation (SD). Participants were divided into three global MMSE groups; preserved function (global MMSE 27), minimally impaired function (global MMSE 26 to 23), and moderately impaired function (global MMSE 22). This MMSE grouping were based on a tertile split. To have a similar number of individuals for each group a cut-off MMSE value was used to divide the three groups. The differences in mean values among the three global MMSE groups were examined using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and those between two groups were evaluated using the unpaired Student’s t-test. Unpaired Student’s t-test was done between men and women, or survivor and non- survivor for comparing MMSE scores. The categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test. The associations between the three global MMSE groups and 10 year mortality rates were assessed using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses in which no adjustment was made, or only adjustment for sex was made, both sex and education periods were adjusted, or hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and diet were adjusted. Proportional hazards assumption using Schoenfeld residuals was not tested in the Cox models. A comparison of the survival rates among the three global MMSE groups was conducted by the Kaplan–Meier method, followed by a log-rank test to assess the significance between the survival curves. The results were considered to be significant at P0.05. The significance threshold for multiple comparisons made by Cox proportional hazards regression analyses was adjusted using the Bonferroni method of adjusting for multiple comparisons, being changed from 0.05 to 0.0125. Results During the 10 year follow-up period, of the 207 participants, 120 had died, 70 survived, and 17 were lost to follow-up. Of the 120 participants who had died, 38 deaths were due to cardiovascular disease, 22 to senility, 21 to respiratory tract diseases, 16 to cancers, four to extrinsic causes, three to gastrointestinal disease, two to urinary tract disease, two to other diseases, and 12 to unknown causes. ICD-10 codes were I00-I99 for cardiovascular disease, J00-J99 for respiratory disease, C00-D48 for cancer, and R54 for senility.For the total study population, the average global MMSE score (ie, the total score for all eleven items) was 23.8±4.5; for the 90 men, 24.0±4.4, and for the 117 women, 23.6±4.7, a nonsignificant difference. The global MMSE score for the 70 survivors was 24.8±4.0, which is significantly higher than the corresponding scores for the 120 non-survivors (23.1±4.8) (P=0.012). The average education period was 9.4±2.6 years for all subjects, 9.9±3.0 years for men, and 9.0±2.1 years for women (P=0.004). Education period was positively correlated with MMSE score (r=0.259, P0.001). MMSE scores were 21.2±5.1 for individuals who had 6 years or less education (graduated only from elementary school, n=25), 23.8±3.5 for those who had 7–9 years (graduated from junior high school and elementary school, n=76), 24.8±4.2 for those who had 10–12 years (graduated from high school, junior high school, and elementary school, n=74), and 25.3±2.8 for those who had 13 years or more (graduated from university, high school, junior high school, and elementary school, n=20; P=0.001). MMSE scores were 24.8±4.0 for individuals who survived until 95 years or older, 23.1±5.3 for those who survived until 92–94 years, 24.2±4.0 for those who survived until 90 or 91 years, and 22.4±4.8 for those who survived until 85–89 years or less (P=0.029). There was a slight positive correlation between age of death and MMSE scores (r=0.161, P=0.029).We divided the participants into the following three groups based on their cognitive function as shown by their global MMSE scores so that similar numbers of participants were in each group: preserved function (global MMSE 27, n=60), minimally impaired function (global MMSE 26–23, n=86), and moderately impaired function (global MMSE 22, n=59). The baseline characteristics of each group are shown in Table 1. Total mortality was higher in the group with moderately impaired function and lower in the group with preserved function (P=0.017). No significant difference was found in mortalities due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease, or senility. The level of education was higher in the preserved-function group and lower in the moderately-impaired group (P0.001). There were no significant differences in sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, and history of stroke.Table 2 shows the results of the multivariate Cox analysis of the three cognition groups for total mortality without adjustment (Table 2, Group A), with adjustment only for sex (Table 2, Group B), with adjustment for both sex and education (Table 2, Group C), and with adjustment for sex and education, histories of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and diet (Table 2, Group D). Without adjustment, the total mortality was 2.0 times higher in the moderately impaired group than in the preserved group, whereas no significant difference was found between the minimally impaired group and the preserved group. Similarly, with adjustment for sex, the moderately impaired group had 2.2 times higher mortality than the preserved group. The men were 2.1 times more likely to die than the women. With the adjustment for both sex and education, the total mortality was also 2.3 times higher in participants with moderately impaired cognitive function and 1.7 times higher in those with minimally impaired cognitive function compared to those with preserved cognitive function. Using Bonferroni method of adjusting for multiple comparisons, however, total mortality did not differ between the preserved group and the minimally impaired group. The moderately impaired group had 2.6 times higher total mortality, and the minimally impaired group had 1.9 times higher mortality than the preserved group when adjusted for sex and education, histories of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and diet. This difference between the preserved group and the minimally impaired group also disappeared with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparison.We also assessed the associations of disease-specific mortality with the three cognition groups by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Without adjustment, the cardiovascular disease mortality was 2.8 times higher in the participants with moderately impaired cognitive function than in those with preserved cognition (hazard ratio [HR] 2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.198–6.457, P=0.017), and was 3.1 times higher in the former than the latter with adjustment for sex and education (HR 3.08, 95% CI 1.274–7.438, P=0.012). Mortality due to senility was significantly higher in the minimally impaired group compared to the preserved group both without adjustment (HR 5.14, 95% CI 1.150–22.980, P=0.032) and with adjustment for sex and education (HR 4.72, 95% CI 1.028–21.628, P=0.046). These differences in disease-specific mortality disappeared after Bonferroni adjustment. There were no associations between mortality due to respiratory disease or cancer and the three cognition groups. Multivariate Cox analyses were also assessed for 1-point increases in the participants’ global MMSE scores for total mortality without adjustment, with adjustment only for sex, with adjustment for both sex and education, and with adjustment for sex and education, histories of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and diet. Total mortality decreased by 4.3% (HR 0.957, P=0.013) with a 1-point increase in MMSE score when no adjustment was made. With the adjustment for sex, total mortality decreased by 5.5% (HR 0.945, P=0.002) with a 1-point increase in MMSE score, but with the adjustment for both sex and education, the total mortality decreased by 6.3% (HR 0.937, P=0.004) with a 1-point increase in MMSE score. Similarly, total mortality decreased by 6.8% (HR 0.932, P=0.003) with a 1-point increase in MMSE with adjustment for sex and education, histories of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and diet.We also conducted multivariate Cox analyses of 1-point differences in global MMSE scores for disease-specific mortality with and without adjustments for sex and education. Mortality from cardiovascular diseases decreased by 7.6% with a 1-point increase in global MMSE score when adjusted for both sex and education (HR 0.924, 95% CI 0.858–0.995, P=0.036). Without adjustment, senility mortality decreased by 9.8% with a 1-point increase in global MMSE score (HR 0.912, 95% CI 0.853–0.975, P=0.007), and with adjustment for sex and education it decreased by 9.2% (HR 0.908, 95% CI 0.825–0.999, P=0.047). There was no significant association of mortalities due to respiratory diseases or cancers with a 1-point change in global MMSE score with or without adjustment.The results of the multivariate Cox analyses of one MMSE subscale point for total mortality are shown in Table 3; with-out adjustment (Table 3, Group A), with adjustment only for sex (Table 3, Group B), with adjustment both for sex and education (Table 3, Group C), and with adjustment for sex and education, histories of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and diet (Table 3, Group D). With a 1-point increase in time orientation, the total mortality decreased by 15.5% when no adjustment was made; it decreased by 18.8% when an adjustment was made only for sex, it decreased by 18.9% when adjustments were made for sex and education, and it decreased by 21.1% with adjustment for sex and education, histories of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and diet. Similarly, with a 1-point increase in delayed recall of words, total mortality decreased by 19.7% without adjustment, 19.8% with sex adjustment, and 19.4% with adjustment for sex and education.Slight associations between total mortality and MMSE subscale points were also found for naming objects (with no adjustment, with adjustment for both sex and education, and with adjustment for sex and education, histories of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and diet), place orientation (with adjustment for sex, and with adjustment for both sex and education), and listening and obeying (with adjustment for sex, and with adjustment for both sex and education, and with adjustment for sex and education, histories of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and diet). With Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparison, significant associations between total mortality and one MMSE subscale point were only found for time orientation and delayed recall of words.We also performed multivariate Cox analyses of one MMSE subscale point for disease-specific mortality with-out adjustment, with adjustment only for sex, and with adjustment both for sex and education. Mortality due to cardiovascular diseases decreased by 96.6% with a 1-point increase in the naming objects subscale score (HR 0.034, 95% CI 0.004–0.286, P=0.002) when no adjustment was made; it decreased by 95.3% (HR 0.047, 95% CI 0.006–0.397, P=0.005) when adjustment was made for sex, and it decreased by 96.7% (HR 0.033, 95% CI 0.004–0.309, P=0.003) when the adjustment was made for both sex and education. No association was found for other subscale scores with cardiovascular mortality.Mortality due to senility decreased by 35.0% with a 1-point increase in the time orientation subscale score (HR 0.650, 95% CI 0.527–0.802, P0.001) when no adjustment was made; it decreased by 35.4% (HR 0.646, 95% CI 0.519–0.804, P0.001) when adjustment was made for sex, and it decreased by 35.2% (HR 0.648, 95% CI 0.509–0.823, P0.001) when the adjustment was made for both sex and education. Similarly, mortality due to senility decreased by 34.9% with a 1-point increase in the place orientation subscale score (HR 0.651, 95% CI 0.475–0.891, P=0.007) when no adjustment was made, and it decreased by 34.9% (HR 0.651, 95% CI 0.470–0.900, P=0.009) when the adjustment was done for sex, and decreased by 37.9% (HR 0.621, 95% CI 0.423–0.913, P=0.015) when adjusted for both sex and education. No association was found for other subscale scores with senility mortality. Mortality due to respiratory disease or cancer was not associated with any MMSE subscale scores.The survival curves of participants who survived during the 10 year follow-up period among the three cognition groups were determined for all participants (Figure 1A), the men (Figure 1B), and the women (Figure 1C). The average survival period was 95.9 months for the preserved cognition group, 84.8 months for the minimally impaired group, and 77.5 months for the moderately impaired group. The cumulative survival rate was significantly lower in the moderately impaired group than in the preserved group (P=0.003). There was no significant difference in survival rate between the moderately impaired group and the minimally impaired group. Among the 82 surviving men, the average survival period was 85.1 months for the preserved group, 77.4 months for the minimally impaired group, and 59.8 months for the moderately impaired group. The cumulative survival period was significantly shorter in the moderately impaired group than in the preserved group (P=0.004) and compared to the minimally impaired group (P=0.029).Among the 104 surviving women, the average survival period was 106.8 months for the preserved group, 88.9 months for the minimally impaired group, and 95.1 months for the moderately impaired group, with no significant difference in cumulative survival period among the three groups.Discussion In the present study, we observed a relationship between total mortality and impaired cognitive function in a very elderly population (85 year-olds). Total mortality was increased not only with a decrease in global MMSE scores but also with decreases in subscale scores of MMSE, ie, time orientation, delayed recall of words, naming objects, place orientation, and listening and obeying. Both senility-linked mortality and cardiovascular mortality increased with the decrease in global MMSE score, whereas mortalities due to respiratory disease or cancer were not associated with global MMSE scores. Similarly, mortality due to senility increased with decreases in MMSE subscale scores of time orientation and place orientation, and mortality due to cardiovascular disease increased with decreases in the MMSE subscale scores for naming objects. Mortality due to respiratory disease or cancer was not associated with any MMSE subscale scores.The present findings that there were associations in cardiovascular mortality with global MMSE scores or MMSE subscale scores suggest that cerebrovascular diseases together with strokes related to impaired cognitive function may elevate total mortality and cardiovascular mortality in the very elderly. Associations between senility mortality and global MMSE scores or MMSE subscale scores suggest that senility induced by terminal status of cardiac failure, stroke, malnutrition, multiple organ failure or other serious diseases may impair cognitive function in 85 year-olds. Impaired cognitive function found by decreased scores of global MMSE or subscale MMSE may independently predict total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and senility mortality in the community-dwelling very elderly population. A new finding of this study was that these associations were present in community-dwelling 85 year-olds.In a very elderly population (95 year-olds) studied by Borjesson-Hanson et al12 cognitive function measured using the MMSE predicted mortality, and mortality decreased by 13% for each 1-point increase in the MMSE. Another study of a community-dwelling elderly population with the average age of 78.9 years showed that impaired cognitive function as assessed by the MMSE predicted mortality in men and women.13 A low MMSE score was the strongest predictor of mortality in home-dwelling patients aged 75 years and older with cardiovascular disease.14 Mild to moderate cognitive impairment was a major risk for mortality in patients with the mean age of 84 years with acute hip fracture.15 Fast cognitive decline at the time of dementia diagnosis in a community-based elderly population with a mean age of 78.8 years was a major prognostic factor for higher mortality rate.16 Similarly, dementia diagnosed after the age of 75 years was a predictor of mortality.17 These findings are in agreement with our finding that impaired cognitive function was associated with higher mortality in a community-dwelling population of 85 year-olds. Survival periods of people with dementia was 4.3 years for ages 80–89 and 3.8 years for ages 90 and older as estimated according to a population based cohort study with a 14 year follow-up period.18O’Donnell et al8 reported that in people aged 55 years or over at increased cardiovascular disease risk, impairment of cognitive function as shown by the MMSE was associated with increases in the risks of stroke, congestive heart failure, and cardiovascular death. They also found associations of MMSE subscale scores for time orientation, place orientation, calculation, delayed recall, and copying with cardiovascular mortality. We also found, in a very elderly population, that not only all-cause mortality but also disease-specific mortality due to cardiovascular diseases or senility were associated with impaired global cognitive function as determined by the MMSE. Mortality due to cardiovascular diseases also decreased with an increase in the subscale score for naming objects. Thus, our findings have extended the association between impaired global or subscale cognitive function and increased mortality due to cardiovascular disease, in a very elderly population of 85 year-olds.In a study of community-dwelling Japanese aged 79 years and older,9 all-cause mortality increased with decreases in the scores of the MMSE subscales for time orientation, place orientation, calculation, delayed recall, repeating a sentence, and copying a figure. Similarly, in Koreans aged 60 and over, impaired cognitive function as determined by not only global MMSE score, but also the MMSE subscale scores for time orientation and calculation, was associated with increased total mortality.10 We also found in our population an association between total mortality with MMSE subscale scores for time orientation, recall of words, naming objects, place orientation, and listening and obeying, indicating that an association with all-cause mortality may be found for global MMSE scores or MMSE subscale scores even in 85 year-olds, a very elderly population.However, there are limitations in the present study. The number of participants was not large. Many findings of no significant difference in this study are due to small sample size or small number of events. Seventeen of the 207 participants were also lost to follow-up during a 10 year period. The sample used in the present study were not representative of the original study population, but representative of more healthy individuals. There was also an issue of survivorship. Additionally, MMSE was reported to have poor reliability and sensitivity,19,20 and to be poor in discriminating individual cognitive difference in non-demented elderly subjects.21In conclusion, we found that impaired cognitive function as determined by global MMSE scores and by some MMSE subscale scores was an independent predictor of total cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease or senility in a population of 85 year-olds.Acknowledgments This work was supported in part by Grants in Aid for Scientific Research (B) number 24390472 (Yutaka Takata) and number 21390560 (Yutaka Takata).Disclosure There are no conflicts of interest to report.",-,"1.

Removable dental prostheses and cardiovascular survival: A 15-year follow-up study,"S.J. Janket, M. Surakka, J.A. Jones, A. Lam, R.A. Schnell, L.M. Rose, A.W.G. Walls, J.H. Meurman","Objectives: In previous studies, increasing number of teeth predicted better survival and the acute needs for dental treatment predicted mortality. We sought to investigate whether restored dentitions by various removable dental prostheses impact cardiovascular (CVD) longevity. Methods: Kuopio Oral Health and Heart study was initiated as a cross-sectional investigation with 256 subjects with diagnosed coronary artery disease [CAD] and 250 age-and sex-matched controls without CAD in 1995 –1996. The meaning of both groups was 61,30% were females. We appended mortality follow-up records to the baseline data and formulated this 15-year follow up study. We examined the relationship between various types of dental prostheses and cardiovascular mortality by proportional hazard regression analyses. We also explored their correlation to oral and systemic inflammatory markers such as asymptotic dental score and C-reactive protein. Results: In a model adjusted for age, sex and smoking, groups having only natural teeth (NT), removable partial denture(s)[PD] and NT, a PD and a full denture [FD], and FD/FD or FD/NT demonstrated the following hazard ratios for mortality (95% confidence interval). NT both arches: 1.00 [reference] ; PD and NT:0.75 [0.22–2.56] ; PD and FD: 1.99 [1.05–3.81] ; and FD opposed by FD or NT:1.71[0.93–3.13], respectively [fortrend=0.05]. Although statistically not significant, those with PD and NT with mean a number of teeth [Teeth] of 15.4 had better survival compared with those who had all NT [N teeth=22.5]; while those who had FD and PD [Teeth=6.5] had shorter longevity than those with FD/FD or FD/NT [N teeth=3.5]. Conclusions: Although not all subgroups of dental prostheses reached significant relationship with CVD mortality, our study suggests that not only the number [quantity] of remaining teeth but their maintenance [quality] removing potential inflammatory foci, such as pericoronitis or retained root tips, may positively impact on cardiovascular survival.

Introduction The number of teeth was reported to predict mortality in several studies 1–4 and two pathways have been suggested as the mechanism. One pathway is via confounding through behavioural factors such as smoking or socioeconomic status, which parallels poor oral health,5 and the other is through inflammation, where oral infections may contribute to endothelial inflammation and dysfunction.6,7 Several in vitro studies demonstrated invasion of endothelial cells by oral pathogens,8,9 however the establishment of causality between oral infection and CVD requires a longitudinal assessment of the relationship where the predictor, oral infection, should precede the outcome, CVD. Even when a longitudinal study was conducted, inadequate adjustment of confounding made it difficult to affirm true causality. So far, causality establishment in oral and cardiac health relationship is still uncertain as the medical community has noted.10 Only recently, longitudinal data in addition to the current study begins to emerge suggesting a potential causal relationship.11 Systemic inflammation, assessed by plasma C-reactive protein [CRP] levels was highly predictive of mortality 12–14 and acute need for dental treatment was significantly associated with mortality.15 However, notwithstanding their methodological inadequacy as we pointed out,16 there is limited evidence of both increased risk of cardiac events and a short-term elevation of CRP following invasive dental procedures.17,18 The equivocal evidence led to the recent American Heart Association’s statement,which did not support the use of invasive periodontal treatments in an attempt to improve cardiac health.19 However, whether non-invasive dental treatments such as the use of various types of removable dental prostheses can affect cardiovascular survival to different extents is not known.20 Non-use of removable dental prostheses by subjects with limited oral function was associated with reduced intake of fruits and vegetables that may lead to increase in mortality.21 In addition, removable dental prostheses may be associated with other oral infections such as candidiasis, dental caries and gingivitis.22 The aims of the current study were to investigate: 1. whether the various removable dental prostheses offer different relationship with CVD mortality; 2. whether removable dental prostheses are correlated with a variety of inflammatory foci in the oral cavity; 3. whether removable dental prostheses accompany candida or streptococcal infections. We categorized the cohort into four mutually exclusive groups to address these objectives: Having only natural teeth (NT) including the fixed dental prostheses 21; having removable partial denture [PD] and NT (PD/PD is a form of PD/NT); having a combination of PD and a full denture [FD]; and having full dentures [FD] on both arches or FD opposed by a limited number of natural teeth. Since fixed partial dentures (i.e., bridges) that provided comparable functionality to natural teeth were included in the natural teeth group, PD from here on refers to removable partial dentures. We, then, compared the cardiovascular survival among these four groups with various combinations of natural and removable prosthetic dentitions. As more remaining teeth were associated with better survival,23 we hypothesized a decreasing CVD survival gradient from natural teeth, to tooth-born and tissue-born dental prostheses. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Ethical and human subjects’ protection This study was approved by the Joint Ethical Committee of the Kuopio University Hospital and the University of Kuopio and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The longitudinal portion of the study was approved by the Boston University Institutional Review Board. This project adhered to the guidelines set forth by the Declaration of Helsinki and the Belmont Accord to assure the safety of human research subjects. 2.2. Study population Kuopio Oral Health and Heart [KOHH] study was initiated as a cross-sectional study in 1995–1996, to investigate the association between oral health and coronary artery disease [CAD] in Kuopio, Finland. For the current study, we merged mortality outcomes over a 15-year follow-up period to the baseline data consisting of 256 CAD patients and 250 age and sex matched controls with a mean age of 60 and created a prospective follow-up study. At baseline, 256 consecutive patients at Kuopio University Hospital who were referred for coronary angiography and confirmed as having CAD were invited to participate in the KOHH study. The CAD diagnosis was made by the presence of at least 50% stenosis in one of the epicardial arteries. Potential subjects were excluded if they had taken antibiotics during the previous 30 days or had chronic infection other than dental disease. Also, 250 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited from subjects admitted to the general surgery or otorhinolaryngology [ORL] departments at the same hospital for elective surgery. They were considered as not having heart disease based on their medical history and electrocardiogram [ECG] taken during the pre-admission tests. The controls were representative of the population of the same catchment area where the cases arose. The same exclusion and inclusion criteria were applied to the control subjects. Additional exclusion criteria for the CAD group were 1: those who needed emergency coronary bypass surgery or valvular replacement surgery 2; those whose disease status was so grave that a dental examination or dental X-ray could not be performed safely 3; those who required antibiotic prophylaxis prior to periodontal probing. Further details regarding this cohort have been published elsewhere.7,24–26 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14967717; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ 20666873; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20177131. 2.3. Predictor assessment At the beginning of the study [1995, 1996], a single examiner [MS] performed all clinical dental examinations and pantomography radiology examinations following the World Health Organization format. The number of teeth as a predictor in this study included sound or repaired teeth, excluding non-restorable root tips. Using a mouth mirror and a #5 Hu-Friedy explorer, the number of remaining teeth, type of dental prostheses (partial dentures made of acrylic or metal; full dentures) and other oral pathologies were examined under the dental light. The cohort was categorized: group 1 had natural teeth [NT] on both arches; group 2 had a combination of partial dentures [PD] and NT; group 3 had a combination of PD and full denture [FD]; group 4 had FDs; i.e., FDs both arches or FD on one arch and opposing natural teeth. Dental infections such as periapical lesions that generally signify long standing dental caries, pericoronitis defined as infection/inflammation surrounding 3rd molars, [radiolucent follicle around the retained or erupting third molars with diameter >3 mm in the pantomogram], or numbers of root remnants with soft tissue inflammation [dental hard tissues are usually destroyed by advanced dental caries leaving only tips of the root], amount of vertical bone loss [measured from cemento-enamel junction in mm], calculus deposits, and restorations with overhangs were recorded. The details of dental examinations have been published elsewhere.7 The single examiner [MS] was not calibrated but his over 25-years of experience as a dentist would proffer a reasonable conformation to the current standard of dental examination and this has been proven by an excellent agreement [kappa = 0.9] of the two pantomogram readings. 2.4. Ascertainment of the endpoints The outcome, CVD mortality, was assessed using the mortality records obtained from the Finnish Death Registry in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. Each resident of Finland has a unique identifier number and the Office of Statistics Finland collects all health data including mortality. The reliability of our data entry was 99% by comparing 2009 and 2011 records in a random sample of 100 records. We corrected this error by comparing them to 2010 data. The validity of mortality records was tested by comparing them to the physician’s diagnosis of death from the medical records. In the 100 records we examined, we observed 3 disagreements in ICD-10 codes but upon further detailed investigation, all turned out to be in agreement. For example, the Finnish death registry listed one case as ‘‘I21.4: Acute subendocardial myocardial infarction’’ while the physician’s diagnosis of death was ‘‘I25.1: Athero-sclerotic heart disease’’. In another case, mortality record showed as ‘‘I21.9: Acute myocardial infarction, unspecified’’ while physician’s diagnosis for death was ‘‘I70.9: Generalized and unspecified atherosclerosis’’. Thus, although ICD-10 codes were different in these cases, they described the same pathology. Thus, validity was judged 100%. 2.5. Confounding factors Age in years and smoking in three categories [never-smokers, current smokers and past smokers] were assessed. Body mass index [BMI] was calculated by weight in kg divided by squared height in metres. C-reactive protein [CRP] was measured by immuno-turbidimetry utilizing the HITACHI 717 analyzer. The reported Coefficient of Variation [CV] for CRP assay was between 8.1% and 11.4%.27,28 All blood samples were analyzed immediately in the hospital laboratory. Total cholesterol [TC], triglyceride [TG], and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL] were measured by the automated enzymatic technique after overnight fasting. Low density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol levels were estimated by the Friedewald formula. The analyses were performed in batches including both cases and controls to evenly distribute any potential environmental changes and measurement variability. Diagnosis of hypertension [HTN] and diabetes were ascertained by medical record review by one of the authors [MS]. Subjects were categorized as hypertensive or having diabetes if their medical records documented these diagnoses or their treatments. Education was assessed as years of schooling. 2.6. Statistical analysis Those who died of non-CVD causes were excluded from the analyses. Using Statistical Analysis System [SAS] version 9.1, the basic characteristics such as mean age, sex, smoking status, type of removable dental prostheses and cholesterol subgroup levels were compared between those who died during the follow-up and those who were alive on May 31st, 2011. In these bivariate analyses, t-tests, chi square tests or Wilcoxon non-parametric tests were used as dictated by the normality of the variable distributions. In multivariate analyses, we used Cox proportional hazard modelling after testing the proportional hazard assumption. In model 1, the impact of the dental prostheses at baseline on mortality was assessed controlling for age, sex, and smoking in linear trend. In model 2, we assessed the hazard ratios of the individual group of prostheses. Since the sample size in proportional hazard regression is the event rate, [i.e., CVD mortality = 80] which may be too small, we used logistic regression [N = 461] for additional adjustment of diabetes, hypertension and education in a fully adjusted model. Adjusting intermediate outcomes on the causal pathway such as dietary impact or baseline coronary artery disease status would be inappropriate. We further assessed potential oral inflammatory factors stratified by the types of dental prostheses to explore whether candidiasis, streptococcal infections or other inflammatory burden that may contribute to endothelial dysfunction. We conducted sensitivity analyses with and without total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL], body mass index [BMI] and statin use to examine whether these factors substantially change the risk estimates for CVD mortality. SAS automatically excludes the subjects with missing values in the outcome, predictor, or covariates. Thus, final sample size varies depending on the number of covariates adjusted and their missing values. 3. Results The comparison of the baseline characteristics in CAD [N = 256] and control groups [N = 250] was published in 2004.7 The longitudinal portion of the study with median follow-up of 15.8 years accrued 124 mortalities as of May 31st, 2011. Of these, 80 were cardiovascular deaths with documented ICD-10 codes I00–I99. Given 50% of the baseline prevalence of CAD, high CVD mortality was expected. There were 200 [44%] subjects who had natural teeth [NT] on both arches, 26 [5.7%] who had a partial denture [PD] and NT, 26 [5.7%] with a FD and a PD, and 202 [44.5%] with FD on one or both arches. The general characteristics of the cohort are presented in Table 1. Most cardiovascular risk factors were significantly higher in non-survivors. In age, sex and smoking adjusted proportional hazard models as well as the fully adjusted logistic model, decreasing number of natural teeth appears to be associated with shorter lifespan. However,the trend was not monotonic. For example, the group with NT and PD which had mean number of teeth [Teeth] 15.4 presented lower risk of CVD mortality than those who had all natural teeth [Teeth = 22.5]. The group with PD and FD [Teeth = 7.4] had higher risk of CVD mortality than those who had FD only or with opposing natural teeth [Teeth = 3.6]. These facts are illustrated in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table 2. To examine the coexisting inflammatory sources associated with the dental prostheses, the distribution of potential oral inflammatory foci stratified by the types of prostheses is presented in Table 3. CRP levels appeared to increase with decreasing NT and increasing frequency of tooth-born and tissue-born dental prostheses. In similar fashion, the asymptotic dental infection score, which we stochastically created from this data set,7 shows a sharply increasing inflammatory burden at PD/FD group and FD/FD group. Adjusting total, LDL cholesterol levels, BMI or statin intake did not materially change the risk estimates for mortality: without these adjustment, the linear trend of the hazard ratio [HR] of dental prostheses was 1.18 compared with the NT group; with BMI adjustment, HR increased slightly to 1.20 while statin intake slightly lowered risk to 1.15, respectively; when total or LDL cholesterol was adjusted, HR remained at 1.17. 4. Discussion In this study, decreasing numbers of natural teeth appears to be associated with shorter cardiovascular longevity. However, merely having more teeth may not lead to better survival. Rather, increasing number of teeth in combination with reducing oral inflammatory sources was associated with cardiovascular longevity. Although the small sample size precludes absolute confidence in our results, the oral infection score or CRP levels in the groups with PD/NT or PD/FD strongly suggest that inflammation may affect CVD longevity. This is consistent with several reports that inflammation is a pivotal part of mortality.12,13 It appears that good oral health maintenance along with timely elimination of inflammatory foci may protect from cardiovascular mortality. This is in agreement with studies reporting that brushing and flossing was associated with better survival 29 and protection from dementia.30 Among clinicians, the prevailing thesis is that removable partial dentures are associated with increasing levels of infection such as gingivitis, candidiasis or streptococcal infection.31–33 However, our results suggest that the relationship of partial dentures and oral inflammatory output may not be monotonic. Rather, it can bring better survival than those with all natural teeth or an increased mortality compared to those with FDs, depending on their oral health maintenance. The greatest number of retained roots, one of the most significant inflammatory sources in our oral infection score, was observed in the group with PD/FD which may explain its higher risk in CVD mortality than the group with mostly FD. The lower number of periapical lesions or pericoronitis in the group with NT/PD may explain why this group had lower risk of mortality than the group with all natural teeth. Taken, together, we conclude that PD per se, may not determine the CVD mortality but the accompanying oral health maintenance may influence cardiovascular health. Socioeconomic status [SES] has been implicated as a confounding factor in the relationship of oral health and cardiovascular health. However, in our analyses, adjusting for education did not materially change the relationship of dental prostheses types and CVD mortality. Our results are consistent with other studies reporting no influence of SES from Scandinavia where the living standard is high and access to healthcare is adequate.1,34 Although poorly constructed fixed dental prostheses can induce inflammation, well-constructed fixed dental prostheses can provide comfortable function with very little increase in inflammation of the individual practices effective daily oral hygiene as we have observed in our clinical practices. Our results suggested that LDL cholesterol was not a significant predictor of CVD mortality perhaps because the study subjects with CAD in our study already had heeded to the physician’s advice of adopting a diet and exercise regimen or taking statins. Furthermore, our observation was corroborated by other studies.35,36 Consequently, statin intake was not a significant determinant for CVD mortality. 4.1. Strengths The first strength is that we controlled for smoking, diabetes, hypertension and CRP which some previous studies neglected. The second strength is the homogeneous Finnish ethnicity and uniformly high living standard that minimized confounding by socioeconomic status [SES] factors. 4.2. Limitation The first limitation is the small sample size with 4 categories of predictor. For this reason, we could not conduct pairwise comparisons but could assess only the trend. However, we adjusted the most important risk factors, albeit in simpler linear forms, to avoid model overfitting. The second limitation is that baseline data was collected only once and we have no information on the changes in some time-varying variables. 5. Conclusion This study suggests that merely keeping large numbers of teeth may not translate into cardiovascular longevity. However, maintaining many teeth, both natural and artificial, while simultaneously reducing oral inflammatory foci appear to impact positively on cardiovascular survival. Future larger studies are warranted. Conflict of interest statement All authors declare no conflict of interest.

"Missing, unreplaced teeth and risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality","Christian Schwahn, Ines Polzer, Robin Haring, Marcus Dörr, Henri Wallaschofski, Thomas Kocher, Torsten Mundt, Birte Holtfreter, Stefanie Samietz, Henry Völzke, Reiner Biffar","Background: A dentition of at least 20 teeth is associated with sufficient masticatory efficiency and is a stated health goal of the World Health Organisation. We examined whether subjects with missing, unreplaced teeth had an increased mortality risk. Methods: We used data prospectively collected from those participants in the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania who had fewer than 20 remaining teeth, resulting in a sample of 1803 participants with a median age of 64 years. Of those, 188 subjects had 9 or more unreplaced teeth. During a median follow-up period of 9.9 years, 362 subjects died, 128 of whom of cardiovascular causes. Results: We found that having 9 or more unreplaced teeth was related to all-cause mortality (rate ratio 1.53, 95%CI: 1.11–2.10; adjusted for variables according to causal diagrams: remaining teeth, age, sex, education, income, marital status, partnership, and oral health behaviour) and cardiovascular mortality (rate ratio 1.94, 95% CI:1.15–3.25). When adjusting not only for the variables according to causal diagrams but also for smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, the rate ratio was 1.43 (95%CI: 1.05–1.96) for all cause mortality and 1.88 (95% CI: 1.10–3.21) for cardiovascular mortality. Conclusions: A reduced, unrestored dentition is associated with increased mortality risk. Thus, clinicians and dietitians have a responsibility to consider individual chewing ability in nutritional recommendations. Keywords: Fatal outcome, Cause of death, Dental prosthesis, Tooth loss, Prospective studies","1. Introduction Cardiovascular [1–3] and all-cause [1,4] mortality are related to an individual's number of teeth. Two major pathways may mediate this relationship, the systemic inflammatory response due to periodontal disease [5–10] or chronic dental infection [11] and the effects of masticatory dysfunction on dietary behaviour, nutrition [12], and digestive processes [13]. Masticatory function depends, to a large extent, on having a sufficient number of teeth, either original or replaced [14]. Detrimental changes in dietary intake caused by poor dental status have been proposed to link oral health and cardiovascular diseases [15,16]. If the restoration of missing teeth by removable or fixed dental prostheses has a beneficial effect on mastication and diet [17–19], replacing missing teeth may hypothetically decrease mortality risk. Previous research has focused on the number of missing or remaining teeth as the exposure [1–4]. However, we showed in a systematic review that few studies have considered denture use [20,21], and that no study has ever investigated whether the number of unreplaced teeth affects mortality [22]. The number of remaining teeth is a nonspecific marker of dental disease experience, whereas the number of unreplaced teeth may be considered to be a proxy for the current status of masticatory efficiency (Fig. 1). Subjects with the same number of remaining teeth do not necessarily have the same number of unreplaced teeth; some may have received dental prostheses for missing teeth, whereas others may not have received prostheses. A dentition of at least 20 teeth is associated with sufficient masticatory efficiency and is a stated health goal of the World Health Organisation [23]. Thus, for 9 or more unreplaced teeth (28 minus 19 teeth), one can reasonably assume a reduced masticatory efficiency. Analysis of the length of the induction period allows for characterising an exposure–outcome relationship [24] and for falsifying the pathway assumed. Therefore, the observation period should cover a reasonable induction period, which we chose based on our recent meta-analysis [22]. For the relationship between the number of unreplaced teeth and mortality, it is justified to presume an induction period of at least 5 years, as suggested by two studies by Nakanishi and colleagues [25,26]. They reported the effect of chewing disability on mortality during a 9-year observation period but did not observe the outcome during the first 4.5 years of follow-up. Consequently, we examined in a population-based sample whether subjects with unreplaced teeth had increased mortality risk over an observation period of 10 years. Given that masticatory function mediates the link between oral health and mortality, we expected a stronger effect on mortality with an increasing number of missing, unreplaced teeth, compared to the number of remaining (or missing) teeth. For the exposure to periodontal disease and cardiovascular outcomes, the associations are stronger among younger versus older participants [27]. Because subjects with a reduced dentition are generally older, we supposed the effect of periodontal disease on mortality to be weak in our sample, which is also supported by recent findings of our working group [28–31]. 2. Methods 2.1. Study population The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) is a population-based, cohort study conducted in West Pomerania in northeastern Germany [32]. The Online-Only Material provides further details of this study. The net sample (without migrated or deceased persons) comprised 6265 eligible subjects. All of those 4308 (68.8%) subjects who agreed to participate were Caucasian. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Data were collected between October 1997 and May 2001 after written, informed consent was obtained from each participant. 2.2. Mortality follow-up Information on vital status was collected from population registries at annual intervals from the time of recruitment into the study through 15 December, 2009. Participants were followed from study entry until withdrawal, emigration, death, or end of the follow-up period. The number of months between the baseline examination and death, loss to follow-up, or end of the follow-up period was used as the follow-up length. Death certificates were requested from the local health authorities and coded by a certified nosologist according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Additionally, 2 internists (Drs. Wallaschofski and Dörr) independently validated the underlying cause of death and consulted with a third internist (Dr. Völzke) in cases of disagreement. Cardiovascular disease comprised the ICD-10 codes I10 to I 79. Deaths where the specific cause was unavailable were not included in the analysis of cardiovascular mortality. 2.3. Dental measures Licensed dentists performed the entire oral examination, which included the dental and prosthetic status [33]. The maximum number of teeth was set to 28 because third molars tend to be impacted, congenitally missing or, in European countries, surgically removed owing to anticipated pericoronitis [34]. As explained, the cut-off point for the number of unreplaced teeth was chosen as 9 or more teeth. Having 9 or more unreplaced teeth cannot occur in subjects with at least 20 teeth. Therefore, the main analyses were restricted to subjects having fewer than 20 remaining teeth. To compare effects across different exposures, we used having no teeth (being edentulous) as the reference category. For the assessment of periodontal disease or attachment loss, please see the Online-Only Material. The categories of attachment loss were chosen such that their frequencies correspond to those of the number of remaining teeth. 2.4. Selection of potential confounders Many risk factors have been suggested to confound the relationship between the number of teeth and mortality (eFig. 1). The most clinically important confounder for the relationship between unreplaced teeth and mortality is the number of remaining teeth. If the number of remaining teeth is included in the model, additional adjustment for risk factors for tooth loss may lead to over-adjustment. To reduce a high number of confounders appropriately, causal diagrams are recommended [35]. In many settings, causal diagrams based on directed acyclic graphs (also known as DAGs) are superior to conventional methods such as the change-in-estimate procedure [36] and could lead to different confounder sets. Using the number of unreplaced teeth as the exposure, few con-founders remained in the following minimal adjustment set: number of teeth, age, sex, social determinants (education, income, marital status, and partnership), and oral health behaviour [22]. In a series of causal diagrams, the inclusion of the number of remaining teeth suspended other potential confounders, such as smoking status. For causal diagrams of exposures other than the number of unreplaced teeth, please, see the Online-Only Material of this work and those of a related review [22]. 2.5. Measurement of potential confounders From the interview, we used age, sex, education (b10, 10, or >10 years based on the East German three-level school system), marital status (married, married but separated, single, divorced, or widowed), and living together with or without marriage. Oral health behaviour was assessed by two questions: dental check up during previous year and last oral visit for pain. The smoking questionnaire, which is often prone to residual bias in the analysis of the relationships between oral and systemic diseases [37] was validated [38]. Smoking was categorised as current or former smokers (three doses in each category: b1, 1 to 14, and ≥15 cigarettes per day) or never smokers. Risky alcohol consumption (>20 g alcohol per day for females and >30 g/day for males), physical activity (regularly, more than 1 h per week over the summer or winter) [39] and diagnosed diabetes mellitus were also deter-mined from the interview. From the medical examination, we selected body mass index, which was categorised into obesity (≥30 kg/m2). Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, a diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg or treatment for hypertension, according to a validated interview. The Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical code C10 was used to assess treatment with lipid-modifying agents. Dyslipidemia was defined as total cholesterol ≥6.2 mmol/L, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥4.1 mmol/L, high density lipoprotein cholesterol b1.04 mmol/L or the use of lipid-lowering drugs [40]. From the questionnaire, the monthly household income (in German Marks; 1 Euro=1.956 German Marks) was divided by the square root of the number of people living in the household [41]. Tertiles of household income (limits of 1450 and 2200 German Marks) were chosen for the analysis. Using continuous household income, the reported rate ratios were changed by less than 1%. We combined the two screening questions for depressive disorders from the Composite International Diagnostic Screener [42] using the logical OR operator. 2.6. Statistical methods Statistical analyses were performed using STATA/MP software, release 12.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). Because rate ratio (RR), but not hazard ratio (HR), facilitates analysis of induction periods, we used both Cox regression to calculate HR and a modified Poisson regression approach to calculate RR [43]. In the analysis of induction period, we used two methods to assess the sensitivity of the findings with respect to pre existing diseases [24]. Unless stated otherwise, age was parameterised using a restricted cubic spline function (see the Online-Only Material). The model assumptions, which were examined analytically and graphically, were appropriately met. All reported P-values are two-sided. 3. Results Out of 4308 subjects (2116 men), 15 subjects (6 men) refused the oral examination. An oral examination was not performed on an additional 5 subjects (2 men) for different reasons. We further excluded 53 subjects (38 men) with a history of cancer, and 63 subjects (38 men) were excluded for missing confounder data. The analytic sample was further restricted to those 1803 subjects (897 men) with fewer than 20 teeth as explained above. The median age was 63.6 years with an interquartile range of 17.1 years. During a median follow-up period of 9.9 years and a total of 16 727 person-years, 234 men and 128 women died (81 men and 47 women of cardiovascular disease). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study participants within categories of unreplaced teeth. There was no difference between the groups having 1 to 8 and 9 or more unreplaced teeth in the categorised number of remaining teeth (P=0.44, Fisher's exact test). The proportion of missing values was higher than 5% for the potentially important confounder of household in-come (Table 1). Therefore, models with and without household income are presented. 3.2. All-cause mortality and unreplaced teeth Although subjects with 9 or more unreplaced teeth were younger than those with fewer than 9 unreplaced teeth (60.3±20.8 years versus 64.0±16.8 years, median±interquartile range, P=0.003), their Kaplan–Meier survival was lower (Fig. 2; P=0.010, log-rank test). This finding was confirmed in multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for variables according to causal diagrams: age, sex, categorised number of teeth, education, marital status, partnership, and oral health behaviour (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.16–2.23; RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.16–2.14). With additional adjusting for tertiles of household income, the change-in-estimate was b10% (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.12–2.20; RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.11–2.10). The rates and ratios across the strata of the number of remaining teeth, as the main confounder, are presented in Table 2. When adjusting not only for the variables according to the causal diagram, including household income, but also for smoking status, risky alcohol consumption, physical activity, obesity, hypertension, diagnosed diabetes, and dyslipidemia, the relation was still present (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.04–2.07; RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.05–1.96; n= 1673 be-cause of missing values). Several sensitivity analyses confirmed the reported results (eTable 1, Online-Only Results). Sex differences did not occur. 3.3. Cardiovascular mortality and unreplaced teeth Kaplan–Meier curves show a more than 2-fold higher risk for cardiovascular mortality in subjects having 9 or more unreplaced teeth compared with those having fewer than 9 unreplaced teeth (Fig. 3; P= 0.007, log-rank test). Unreplaced teeth had a greater effect on cardiovascular mortality than on all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.28–3.56; additionally adjusted for household income: HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.12–3.36; RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.32–3.43 and 1.94, 95% CI 1.15–3.25, respectively). The 128 cardiovascular events were related to 17 variables, which yielded an acceptable ratio of 7.5 [36,44]. When adjusting not only for the variables according to the causal diagram, including household income, but also for smoking status, risky alcohol consumption, physical activity, obesity, hypertension, diagnosed diabetes, and dyslipidemia, the relation was still present (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.08–3.33; RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.10–3.21; n=1654 because of missing values). Several sensitivity analyses confirmed the reported results (eTable 2, Online-Only Results). 3.4. Induction periods for mortality and unreplaced teeth The mentioned RRs did not take into account an induction period for the unreplaced teeth to have an effect. The adjusted RRs of empirical induction periods from 1 to 9 years for all-cause mortality are shown in Fig. 4 (details are given in eTables 3 and 4 for all-cause mortality, and in eTables 5 and 6 for cardiovascular mortality). 3.5. Mortality and remaining teeth We did not find a relationship between the number of remaining teeth (baseline characteristics in eTable 7) and cardiovascular mortality in a model adjusting for sex and continuous age (Table 3). The different parameterizations of age (Table 3) show how the number of remaining teeth is prone to residual confounding by age. There was, however, an inverse relationship between the continuous number of remaining teeth and all-cause mortality after adjusting, based on causal diagrams, for age, sex, education, marital status, partnership, smoking status, risky alcohol consumption, physical activity, diagnosed diabetes, obesity, and hypertension (Table 3). 3.6. Mortality and periodontal disease Because attachment loss was not measured on crowned teeth, the attachment loss sample was restricted to 1598 subjects (baseline characteristics in eTable 8). We did not find a relationship between the proportion of attachment loss ≥6 mm and cardiovascular mortality in a model adjusting for sex and continuous age (Table 4). The probing depth ≥3 mm as the exposure (1768 subjects) gave similar results. The number of 5 cardiovascular events per variable was small [44]in the model for the exposure to attachment loss. However, our finding of the absence of a relationship between attachment loss ≥6 mm and cardiovascular mortality is based on the model adjusting only for sex and age by using restricted cubic splines (114 events and 7 variables). 4. Discussion We found a moderate relationship between the number of unreplaced teeth and mortality across the categories of the number of remaining teeth in subjects with fewer than 20 remaining teeth. This relationship was stronger for cardiovascular mortality than for all-cause mortality. Thus, the risk of cardiovascular mortality was related to a meaningful number of unreplaced teeth rather than to the number of remaining teeth or periodontal disease. The latter two exposures showed similar effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Confidence in the validity of our findings with respect to the number of unreplaced teeth results not only from common sensitivity analyses but also from the analysis of the empirical induction periods. Moreover, we are the first to use the number of unreplaced teeth as a more valid exposure to masticatory efficiency, than the number of remaining teeth. Two different induction period methods, with respect to sensitivity to pre existing diseases, yielded similar effects of unreplaced teeth, thus strengthening our findings. The large effect after an empirical induction period of 9 years is not surprising, given that less specific, more remote causes of cardiovascular diseases may be even more important than pathogenetic mechanisms [45]. The effects of unreplaced teeth, without the appropriate allowance for the empirical induction period, would be underestimated [46]. Moreover, the more systemic effects of reduced masticatory efficiency due to unreplaced teeth may have a longer induction period than 9 years. Our empirical induction period length is, however, in line with the observations of Nakanishi and colleagues [25,26]. Outstandingly, a short period would have falsified our hypothesis. Periodontal variables were not associated with cardiovascular mortality. Our comparison between the effects of periodontal disease and 9 or more unreplaced teeth on mortality, however, is limited by edentulism on the one hand and a dentition with at least 20 remaining teeth on the other hand. In addition, the confounder sets differ. Provided a relationship between periodontal disease and cardiovascular mortality via low-grade systemic inflammation exists, the lack of such a finding in our study may have different reasons. For example, in our population teeth are extracted at an earlier stage of periodontal disease [28]. In general, the association between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease is stronger among subjects younger than 60 years [27]. Furthermore, the effect of periodontal disease may be underestimated because of a lengthy induction period. Aside from this underestimation, categorising attachment loss leads to loss of information, thereby reducing the statistical power. Nevertheless, if the relationship between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease was really mediated by tooth loss and unreplaced teeth, previous studies, not accounting for these mediators, might have reported false positive findings regarding the inflammatory pathway. In contrast, the effect of unreplaced teeth on mortality is not mediated by the underlying reasons for tooth loss. What appears to be most important is the number of missing teeth that are not replaced. A relationship between the number of unreplaced teeth and mortality is plausible for at least four reasons. First, masticatory efficiency is reduced in subjects with 9 or more unreplaced teeth [47]. Insufficient masticatory function affects the digestion of food [48] and produces alimentary problems [49]. Second, an increased number of unreplaced teeth restricts dietary choices and deteriorates nutritional intake, leading to weight changes and a higher risk of developing chronic diseases [50,51]. Third, chewing hard foods with a severely reduced and unrestored dentition leads to oral mucosal lesions in edentulous regions of the dental arch, thus allowing pathogens to enter the bloodstream [52]. Finally, unreplaced teeth are associated with mental health problems [49]. Besides tooth-related conditions, additional factors influence food selection and malnutrition, including personal, environmental, cultural, and societal contexts [53,54]. Notably, the majority of analyses of diet and nutrition have lacked information on the subjects' dental and prosthetic status. A relationship between the number of teeth and cardiovascular mortality has been found in the previous studies that appropriately controlled for confounders [1–3]. Some associations between the number of remaining teeth and cardiovascular diseases have previously been found in our study population [29–31]. Two well-controlled studies have reported a statistical relationship between the number of remaining (or missing) teeth and all-cause mortality [1,4], whereas others have not [3,55]. With respect to the specificity of cardiovascular mortality in relation to the number of teeth, however, it is well-known that diet can improve health and prevent disease, particularly cardiovascular disease [56]. The misclassification introduced by using the number of remaining teeth for the number of unreplaced teeth might be less relevant in a health care system that does not cover for the cost of prosthodontic devices. The higher the funding for public dental services for prostheses, the higher may be the misclassification. The German health insurance system favours basic prosthodontic care, including fixed and removable dental prostheses, which results in a high level of restorative care. The encouragement to use prosthodontic care makes it unlikely that the decision for replacement of missing teeth varies strongly over time. However, we did not analyse the change in exposure, a limitation that our study shares with the vast majority of other studies on the relationship between oral and cardiovascular diseases. Further limitations of our study merit comment. Information bias and unmeasured confounding may have influenced our results. In fact, the observational nature of our study limits causal inference. Moreover, subjects in our study were Caucasian, thus confining the generalisability. Aside from these facts, the length of the observation period restricted the analysis of other empirical induction periods. Although the number of cardiovascular events is small for unreplaced teeth as the exposure, it is not necessarily a limitation [36,44]. However, we could not examine exposure effects in subcategories of cardiovascular disease, particularly whether the effect is restricted on coronary heart disease as suggested in a large study over 12 years [57]. There are also several strengths of our analysis of the effects of unreplaced teeth. First, we excluded subjects with a history of cancer because they are quite likely to have altered dietary patterns and a loss of teeth. Second, the analytic sample was restricted to subjects having fewer than 20 remaining teeth which corresponded to the cut-off point of having at least 9 unreplaced teeth. The sample restriction in a randomised clinical trial is to have the same. Moreover, especially in observational studies it is highly valid to select study groups for homogeneity with respect to potential confounders, such as the number of remaining teeth and, therefore, age. Third, we minimise residual confounding by age by using restricted cubic splines. Fourth, to select con-founders we used causal diagrams, which disclosed our mechanistic model. Furthermore, we improved a related model from a topical text-book in advanced epidemiology [58]. To conclude, there is a relationship between the number of unreplaced teeth and mortality. An induction period of at least 9 years appears to be required for this relationship to develop. Future research on intermediate stages between prosthetic status and cardiovascular mortality is needed to explore the causal mechanisms of this relationship. Although an appropriate intervention, to reduce mortality, has not yet been proven, and perhaps cannot be proven for ethical reasons, clinicians and dietitians have a responsibility to contribute to overall health by maintaining masticatory efficiency and to consider individual chewing ability in their nutritional recommendations.

Number of teeth – a predictor of mortality in 70-year-old subjects,"Tor Osterberg, Gunnar E Carlsson, Valter Sundh, and Dan Mellstrom","Objectives: To investigate whether the number of teeth at age 70 is an independent predictor of mortality. Methods: Within the gerontological population studies in Go ̈teborg, Sweden, four birth cohorts born in 1901⁄1902,1906⁄1907, 1911⁄1912 and 1922 were examined cross-sectionally at 70 years of age. The total number of participants in the odontological cohorts was 1803. Mortality data were collected from the national Swedish health registers.Cox regression models were used to measure the association between mortality and the number of teeth with adjustment for covariates such as health factors, socio-economic and lifestyle factors. Results: The prevalence of edentulism showed a marked change from 51% in the first cohort to 16% in the last cohort.The 7-year mortality rate was 14% in women and 28% in men, and the highest in edentulous men in the last two cohorts (42% and 47% respectively).The 7-year mortality including all four cohorts showed a hazard ratio of 0.96(95% CI 0.94–0.98;P< 0.001) for the number of teeth with adjustment for cohort. The corresponding 18-year mortality including the three first cohorts showed a hazard ratio of 0.98 for women and 0.97 for men. The number of teeth was an independent statistically significant predictor of 7-year mortality in both genders and of 18-year mortality in men. Conclusions: The result showed that each remaining tooth at age 70 decreased the 7-year mortality risk by 4%. The difference between edentulous subjects and dentate subjects with 20 teeth regarding 7-year mortality was significantly higher in the last compared to the first cohort. The number of teeth was a significant predictor of mortality independent of health factors, socio-economic status and lifestyle. Keywords: dental health; elderly;epidemiology; general health; survival","Associations between edentulism and mortality have been documented in several studies (1–7). The results have not always been consistent with respect to gender, age and localities of samples, and influence of common risk factors for death. As missing teeth are a surrogate marker for previous dental disease, the relationship has been suggested to depend, among other factors, on dental infection. Therefore, the associations between periodontal diseases and coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), both common risk factors for increased mortality, have attracted growing interest during the last few decades (8–12). There have been several reports that periodontal infection increases the risk of CHD and CVD, but the quality of many of these studies and their results have been questioned (13, 14). Two recent meta-analyses found, in the few studies fulfilling their inclusion criteria, indications that periodontal disease may increase the risk of CHD and CVD (15, 16). However, one of the meta-analyses emphasized that there was no evidence of strong associations, and the other one concluded that the statistical effect size was small. Because there are several common risk factors for oral and systemic diseases, careful interpretations of their associations with mortality are needed (17, 18). Based on this background and as the results on associations between dental health and mortality have not been conclusive, it is evident that further studies would be of interest. It was therefore the aim of this study to investigate if the number of teeth at age 70 was a predictor of all-cause mortality independent of previously established risk factors for mortality in elderly. The hypothesis was that a smaller number of teeth at age 70 would be associated with greater mortality in the following years. Materials and methods Within the gerontological population studies in Go ̈teborg, Sweden (H70), four birth cohorts born in 1901 ⁄ 1902 (I), 1906 ⁄ 1907 (II), 1911 ⁄ 1912 (III) and 1922 (V) were examined at 70 years of age in 1971 ⁄ 1972, 1976 ⁄ 1977, 1981 ⁄ 1982, 1992 ⁄ 1993. The studies included medical, dental, psychological, nutritional and socio-economic data. Details of the study design have been presented elsewhere (1, 19–23). This study was approved by the ethical committee, Go ̈teborg University, Go ̈teborg, Sweden (Dnr. S 227-00). The odontological investigations were performed in 40% of the sample of the cohorts I and II and in the total sample of cohorts III and V. The total number of participants in the odontological investigations was 1803 subjects (Table 1). Cohort IV was not included in this study because it was only examined at age 75 and 80. In the odontological samples of cohorts I, II and III, the non responders did not differ in basic demographics from the responders (19–23). In cohort V, a new questionnaire was sent to the nonparticipants. This ‘nonresponse questionnaire’ was completed by 183 subjects, 68% of the nonresponders. These data showed that the prevalence of edentulism was higher in nonresponders than in responders (P < 0.01) but in other aspects such as myocardial infarction, anginal pain, diabetes, cancer, hypertension and smoking, there were no differences except for two factors in men, hypertension and smoking, which were more common in the nonresponders (P < 0.05). Investigations The odontological investigations were based on interviews, clinical and radiographic examinations when the subjects were 70 years of age. In this study only the number of teeth has been used. The recording of teeth was based mainly on clinical findings and included intact, restored and crowned teeth, as well as roots but excluding nonrepairable roots. The study population was coordinated with the national registers of causes of death and cancer including all registered cases up to 31 December 2000. The follow-up time for survival for the oldest cohort (I) was 28 years and for the youngest (V) 7 years (Table 1). Based on previous studies (20, 24–27), the following factors were considered as potential confounders in the analysis of the relationship between the number of teeth and mortality: income (from official register), education, marital status, smoking, physical activity, social activity, drug consumption, diseases, and anthropometric factors. The coding of the potential confounders is described in the following: (1) Education: elementary school, higher education than elementary school; (2) marital status: married, not married. A social activity index was created by combining six variables: reading daily newspaper, reading magazines weakly, accessibility to summer cottage, doing travels, attending association meetings, driving a car. In the present study, the coding used was 0 = doing none of the six activities, 1–6 = the number of activities performed. Smoking was coded in three levels: 0 = never smoked; 1 = previous smoking; 2 = current smoking. Low physical activity was a dichotomization of self-assessed physical level during the period after 60 years of age: 1 = have mainly been physically inactive during that period, 0 = all others. Anthro-pometrical factors such as body height and weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were also taken as confounders. Low BMI was defined as a three-level linear variable: 1 = upper 75% BMI values of the sample; 2 = percentiles 15–25 of the sample; 3 = lowest 15% of the sample. High BMI was defined as a mirror image of low BMI; 1 = lower 75% BMI values of the sample; 2 = percentiles 75–85 of the sample; 3 = highest 15% of the sample. The advantage of this coding is that the effect of low BMI is estimated independent of the effect of high BMI, and vice versa. The result is comparable with a discrete spline model with regard to the effect of BMI on mortality. The following prevalent diseases and drug consumption were defined in accordance with structured interviews and medical examinations: diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, claudicatio intermittens, chronic bronchitis, cancer, number of drugs used, use of antihypertensive drug, and self-assessed health (feeling healthy, not feeling healthy). Serum cholesterol and triglycerides, blood hemoglobin and plasma glucose were also included as potential confounders. These methods have been described previously (19–27). Income and social activity index were not recorded in cohort V. Statistics Cox proportional hazards regression models (Cox models for short) were used to measure and test the association between the number of teeth and survival with or without covariates such as health, socio-economic and lifestyle factors, and cohort (year of birth). Tests of interaction were performed to find out if the association between cohort and survival was the same in different levels of the number of teeth, or equivalently, if the association between the number of teeth and mortality was the same in all cohorts. Using the number of teeth as a predictor of mortality rests on the assumption of an approximately linear effect, and this assumption has been verified by also modelling the mortality risk as a nonlinear function of the number of teeth by using polynomials to power two and three and logarithmic and power transformations 0.5–2.0. None of the nonlinear models improved the association in a substantial or systematic way over simpler linear models. However, this result may partially be due to low power to detect deviation from linearity, and the association is also reported in four nominal categories: edentulous, one to nine remaining teeth, 10–19 remaining teeth and 20 or more remaining teeth. In comparisons, the edentulous group is used as a reference class, with which the three other groups are compared (Tables 2 and 3). Two comparable parameters are used in the analysis, one model estimated and one descriptive. The relative hazard or hazard ratio (HR) is estimated from Cox models and the (cumulative) mortality risk of death per 1000 risk years is a descriptive measure of the sample that defines the sample observed relative risk (RR). As HR is a type of relative risk, it is for models with only one explanatory contrast factor directly comparable with the sample observed RR both in effect size and confidence interval. More formally, HR is an estimate of the instantaneous risk of death in a subgroup of the population relative to the risk of death in a reference group at any arbitrarily chosen point of time during the follow-up period. HR is calculated as exp(b), where b is the regression coefficient of the Cox model. This means that the effect of the factor is assumed to be linear in the log HR scale, which must be considered when interpreting the reported parameter values. If HR is 0.96 for the number of teeth (corresponding to a 4% reduction in hazard per teeth), the model estimated difference in hazard between subjects with 0 teeth and 20 teeth is not 80% (4 · 20), but 56% (=1 ) 0.9620). The sample observed mortality risk is the number of deaths in a group divided by the total number of years ⁄ 1000 at risk in the group, and RR is the ratio between the observed risk in one subgroup and the reference group. The number of risk years for a person in the study is the number of days from the date of medical and odontological examination at age 70 to the date of death, or to the end of 7-year (or 18-year) follow-up if still alive, divided by 365.25. Confidence intervals for relative risks are calculated as conditional binomial intervals. The software used for the statistical analysis was sas version 8.02 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Results The prevalence of edentulism showed a marked change during the 20 years covered by the four cohorts of 70-year-old subjects: from 51% in cohort I (examined in 1971 ⁄ 1972) to 16% in cohort V (examined in 1991 ⁄ 1992). During the same time period, the proportion of subjects with >=20 teeth increased from 14% to 38%. Associations between mortality and birth year The 7-year mortality rate was higher in men (28%) than in women (14%) when all cohorts were pooled. The mortality in men decreased from 31% in cohort I to 23% in cohort V, and for women from 16% to 11%. A Cox regression model on 7-year mortality showed 2% lower risk per later birth year both in females and males (hazard ratio, HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.97–0.99 in the total model). The association between 18-year mortality and birth year (1901–1912) was somewhat weaker and not significant at the 5% level, HR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.97–1.00. This indicates that the change in mortality rate is smaller between cohorts 1901–1902 and 1911–1912 than between cohorts 1911–1912 and 1922, assuming that the birth year effect is the same for the 7- and 18-year follow-ups. This assumption is confirmed from the results of the model with 7-year follow-up for birth years 1901–1912, giving HR = 0.99, CI 0.96–1.02. Associations between the number of teeth and mortality The survival rate according to the number of teeth differed between genders and cohorts (Figs 1 and 2). The total cumulative survival over 7 and 18 years was 80% and 31%, respectively, for edentulous women, 60% and 13% for edentulous men. The corresponding figures for those with >=20 teeth were 93% and 52% for women and 85% and 33% for men (these figures can be calculated from Tables 2 and 3; e.g. for edentulous women on line 0 [number of teeth], the numbers under subjects and deaths from Table 2: 1 ) 71 ⁄ 362 = 0.804 = 80%). The difference in 7-year mortality between edentulous subjects and those with ‡20 teeth was evident among men in cohorts II and III and in both genders in cohort V. The 7-year survival for men in cohort V was 94% for those with ‡20 teeth, and 53% for the edentulous subjects. The same difference in 18-year mortality was most marked in women in cohort I and among men in cohort II (Figs 1 and 2). The unadjusted excess mortality risk over 7 years for edentulous people compared with those with >=20 teeth were approximately three for both women and men (70 ⁄ 23 and 31 ⁄ 11 from Table 2) with a relative risk of 2.78 (95% CI 2.0–4.0) for the total sample. Also for the 18-year mortality, the excess risk was similar for women and men (Table 3) with a relative risk of 1.61 (1.3–2.0) for the total sample. Among the nonresponders in cohort V (n = 183), there was a lower 7-year mortality probability (relative risk 0.82 in both genders) in those reporting only natural teeth compared with edentulous and partially edentulous subjects with removable dentures. This association, although statistically not significant, was comparable with the result of the main analysis, showing comparable association for corresponding categories (RR 0.50 for women and 0.53 for men). The interaction of the number of teeth and birth year on mortality was significant (P = 0.01), showing a trend in later cohorts against higher mortality among edentulous and a lower mortality among dentate subjects. Associations between the number of teeth and 7- and 18-year mortalities were highly significant for both women and men according to the total cohort-adjusted data (Table 4). Hazard ratios from Cox models for the 7-year period were 0.96 in both women and men, and for the 18-year period 0.98 in women and 0.97 in men. The association became stronger in the later cohorts; in cohort V, the hazard ratios Association between mortality and the number of teeth and covariates Prevalence of concomitant disorders and conditions at age 70 is presented in Table 5 together with univariate associations with cohort-adjusted 7-year mortality. A lifestyle factor as physical inactivity was a significant predictor in both genders. Smokers in both genders and previous smokers among women had significantly higher 7-year mortality compared with nonsmokers. The corresponding associations between smoking and 18-year mortality were highly significant in both genders. Diabetes, ischemic heart disease, feeling not healthy, number of drugs, higher serum triglycerides and higher plasma glucose were other significant factors for 7-year mortality in both genders (Table 5). According to the multiple Cox regression model, the number of teeth and ischemic heart disease were significant predictors of mortality over 7 years in both genders, but other factors differed between men and women (Table 6). In women, lower BMI, higher level of plasma glucose, and impaired self-assessed health were significant predictors, whereas in men lower blood hemoglobin and a higher level of serum triglycerides were significant. Besides these factors, social activity in both genders and drug-treated hypertension in women were predictors of 18-year mortality. However, the number of teeth was not a significant predictor in women (Table 7). Smoking was statistically significant (P <0.01) only in women and in the pooled data, and previous smoking was only significant in the pooled data. If a lower statistical level (P < 0.05) was chosen, smoking was significant for 7-year mortality, and previous smoking for 18-year mortality in women. Tests of interaction between sex and all other predictors of mortality were performed for both uni- and multivariable models. None of the tests reached 5% significance. After adjusting for the most important covariates under investigation in the present study, the main result is that the number of teeth still is an important predictor of mortality. These results are illustrated in Tables 2 and 3, where the unadjusted relative risks for the number of teeth categories are not markedly different from the covariate-adjusted hazard ratios. The estimated effect of one additional remaining tooth on mortality is somewhat lower in the covariate-adjusted model, but still shows an important independent effect in the total and gender-stratified samples and in both follow-up periods, except for the 18-year follow-up of women (Tables 4, 6 and 7). Discussion The results of this study showed that there was a significant association between the number of teeth and mortality independent of other common risk factors. The mortality risk over 7 years was almost three times greater for edentulous people compared with those with >=20 teeth in both genders. A similar result, hazard ratio of 2.6, has been reported for the 10-year mortality in 80-year old edentulous subjects (5). In the present study, it was higher also over 18 years but to a smaller extent (Tables 2 and 3). In the multiple Cox regression model for the 18-year follow-up, the significance of the number of teeth was lost for women (Table 7), although the univariate model demonstrated significant associations for both genders (Table 4). The survival rate was higher with a greater number of remaining teeth at age 70 during the whole observation period. The mortality risk decreased by 4% during the first 7 years of follow-up for each remaining tooth at age 70, which supported the hypothesis set up. In cohort V, the effect was even stronger, 8% in women and 6% in men per each remaining tooth. The hazard ratio for the 18-year mortality had a somewhat lower value (2–3% in the cohort-adjusted data; Table 4). The total 7-year mortality risk decreased with 2% per later birth year, which is a reflection of a general decreasing mortality among elderly people in Sweden from 1970 onwards. The increasing life expectancy is nowadays mostly due to a decreasing mortality in elderly people (28). However, it was also found that in spite of a generally increased survival rate, edentulism is an increasing risk indicator of mortality, particularly in men (Fig. 2). Thus, the survival rate in 70-year-old men born in 1922 was only 53% in edentulous subjects compared with 93% in those with ‡20 teeth. An explanation may be that when dental health is in improving, edentulousness tends to be found more often in a select group of people with negative lifestyle, weak social network, and poor health, risk factors known to be associated with premature death. This has been indicated in previous studies of 70- and 75-year-old subjects (1, 20, 27, 29–31). The explanations in earlier reports on a relationship between oral health and mortality have in general focused on associations between poor dental health and impairment of nutrition, limitations of functional capacities, smoking, and other lifestyle factors, which are known predictors of mortality (1–5). The associations found between edentulism and mortality in an Icelandic study (12) was dependent on smoking. They therefore concluded that the odontologic factors tested were not independent risk factors but surrogate markers for the risk from smoking. A study of a Chinese population sample found that the relationship between tooth loss and increased mortality was not limited to smokers (6). In the present study, the number of teeth was significantly associated with mortality independent of other common risk factors, including smoking. Smoking was in this study coded as two contrast factors comparing current and previous smokers versus nonsmokers. In the univariate analysis, current smoking was a significant predictor for the 7- and 18-year mortalities in both genders. However, in the multiple variable analyses, smoking was not an independent, significant (P < 0.01) factor for the 7-year mortality, and only in women for the 18-year mortality. The explanation may partly be due to selective survival up to 70 years of age, but may also be caused by multicollinearity between smoking and other covariates, for example the relation between low BMI and smoking and between general health status and smoking (26, 32). Also when the amount of tobacco used at age 70 was employed in the analyses, the results were the same: significant in women but not in men. Disease and risk factors such as high levels of blood glucose and serum triglycerides have earlier been shown to be independent risk factors for mortality in our and other studies (24, 33). In the studied cohorts, low bone mineral density was shown to be an independent risk factor for mortality (relative risk 1.39, CI 1.25–1.56) in both genders indicating that functional parameters among elderly can be related to survival (24). The association between low bone density and increased mortality in women has been demonstrated earlier (34). Studies have also shown that impaired dental health⁄ lower number of teeth was significantly associated with lower bone mass, lung volume, muscle strength, cognition, vision and hearing, as well as lower self-assessed health (1, 31). This is in line with results indicating that reduced grip strength is a single marker for frailty (35). Data from this study and earlier presentations from our cohort studies indicate that the number of teeth is a robust predictor of general health, functional capacity, and a factor strongly associated with lifestyle factors such as smoking and physical inactivity (1, 20, 27, 30, 31). However, in the present study, the association between mortality and the number of teeth was to a large extent independent of established risk factors for mortality. These findings warrant further emphasis on preventive and conservative treatment, from childhood to adulthood, to help people to retain their teeth until the old age. Today, it is possible to give edentulous subjects a ‘third dentition’ by means of dental implants. It is not known if replacement of lost teeth with implants can reduce mortality the following years. However, implant treatment has been shown to improve the quality of life (36). The causality of the independent association between the number of teeth and survival is obscure but might to some degree be dependent upon genetic or environmental factors. Studies have shown the same genetic factors for periodontal and cardiovascular disease (37). In several studies, poor dental health and periodontal disease was found to be associated with increased mortality in cardiovascular disease (4, 8, 9, 37–39). However, in another study the association between oral health (including caries and periodontal status) and death in cardiovascular disease was reduced to statistical non significance when adjustment for confounding factors was performed (40). It has also been suggested that the link between periodontal disease and CHD is weak (13, 14). Of further interest in this context is the possible relationship between tooth loss, diet and cardiovascular disease. An extensive study in US women demonstrated that women with fewer teeth have less healthy diets, which could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (41). This might be taken as an indirect support for an association between the number of teeth and mortality as death in cardiovascular disease is common. Indeed, after 70 years of age, death from cardiovascular disease is the predominant cause of death followed by cancer disease. During recent years, studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between inflammation markers and cardiovascular events (42). Periodontal disease is a major cause of tooth loss in elderly and is also related to long-standing inflammation, which can contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (9). Tobacco smoking is a causative risk factor for tooth loss but also for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and pulmonary disease, which contribute to the relation between the number of teeth and mortality. Our data showed that the correlation between remaining teeth and death in cardiovascular disease is almost at the same level as mortality in noncardiovascular causes. However, most elderly have several diseases at the time of death and there is a risk that certain diseases might be under-reported, which needs further investigation. The cohort participation rate decreased substantially with time, and was 62% in the last cohort. The increasing unwillingness to participate in investigations is a trend observed lately in Scandinavia (43). This suggests that the conclusions should be interpreted with some caution. However, the only marked difference between participants and non-participants was prevalence of edentulism indicating that the variation in participation rate might have merely a minor influence on the results. Furthermore, an analysis of the nonresponders in cohort V showed that those reporting only natural teeth had an 18% higher 7-year survival rate than edentulous and partially edentulous subjects with removable dentures, thus also in line with the main results of the study. Conclusions • The results showed that each remaining tooth at age 70 decreased the mortality risk by 4% over 7 years and 2–3% over 18 years. • The interaction of the number of teeth and birth year on mortality showed a trend against higher mortality among edentulous and a lower mortality among dentate subjects in later cohorts. • The number of teeth was a significant predictor of mortality independent of health factors, socio-economic status and lifestyle. This was demonstrated in both genders for 7-year mortality but only in men for 18-year mortality.

Tooth Loss and Subsequent Disability and Mortality in Old Age,"Poul Holm-Pedersen, DDS, Dr Odont, Kirsten Schultz-Larsen, MD, PhD, Niels Christiansen, DDS, PhD, and Kirsten Avlund, PhD, Dr MedSci","OBJECTIVES: To examine whether tooth loss at age 70 is associated with on set of disability at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year follow-up and to mortality at 21-year follow-up. SETTING: Community-based population in Copenhagen. DESIGN: A baseline study of a random sample of 70-year-old people born in 1914 and follow-up 5, 10, 15, and 20 years later. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 573 non disabled individuals participated in the study of 70-year-olds in 1984, 460 participated in the 5-year follow-up, 292 in the 10-year follow-up, 150 in the 15-year follow-up, and 78 in the 20-year follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: Data from interviews and a medical and oral examination. Oral health was measured according to number of teeth (0, 1–9, 10–19,20). Disability was measured using the Avlund Mob-H scale at age 75, 80, 85,and 90. Mortality data were obtained from the National Death Register. RESULTS: Being edentulous or having one to nine teeth was associated with onset of disability at age 75 and 80. Health-related variables and education attenuated the associations between edentulism and onset of disability, although they remained marginally significant, whereas the association between having one to nine teeth and onset of disability remained unchanged and statistically significantat 10-year follow-up (odds ratio53.02, 95% confidence interval (CI)51.26–7.24). Persons who were edentulous at age 70 were at significantly higher risk of mortality 21 years later, also in the adjusted analysis (hazard ratio51.26,95% CI51.03–1.55). CONCLUSION: Tooth loss is independently associated with onset of disability and mortality in old age. The findings indicate that tooth loss may be an early indicator of accelerated aging.","It has been increasingly recognized that diseases and environmental factors that have occurred throughout the life course influence the aging process. Generally, adverse health-related outcomes usually occur later in life, but the biology leading to these events begins much earlier. Consequently, it may be important to identify early signs of accelerated aging, including the possibilities for preventing frailty or disability that occurs unnecessarily early in the life course. Oral health in old age can be seen as a marker of a person’s oral care history, for example, in terms of number of missing teeth, and may be a marker of other diseases in the body and functional decline. It is possible, therefore, that tooth loss is such an early indicator of accelerated aging. Several studies over the past decade have found a relationship between tooth loss and morbidity, in particular, cardiovascular disease and ischemic stroke and mortality (e.g.,1–8). A recent study reported a relationship between tooth loss and mortality in elderly men but not in women.9 Another study showed an association between tooth loss and subclinical cardiovascular disease.10 A Danish longitudinal study from age 75 to 80 found that community-dwelling persons with sustained poor functional ability were more likely to have no or few teeth than others.11 A study of well-functioning old people living in the community also showed that cognitive decline is related to having no or few teeth.12 Tooth loss reflects the ultimate outcome of oral disease over the life course, although tooth removal practices vary. Not only caries and periodontal disease, but also the value placed on tooth retention by dentists and patients and the patient's’ ability to pay for treatments influence the decision to extract teeth, suggesting that tooth loss may also be related to complex behavioral and socioeconomic factors.13 Several studies have shown that individuals in lower socioeconomic groups have fewer teeth than persons in higher socioeconomic groups (e.g.,14–17). In a longitudinal Swedish study, missing teeth were associated with greater all cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, although socioeconomic factors could not explain the association between tooth loss and future cardiovascular disease in this study.18 It is not known whether tooth loss is related to future disability and mortality independent of socioeconomic factors and systemic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine whether tooth loss at age 70 is associated with onset of disability at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year follow-up and to mortality at 21-year follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study is based on data from the longitudinal study of the 1914 population at the Center of Preventive Medicine in Glostrup, Denmark, from 1984 to 2005/06, when the participants were aged 70, 75, 80, 85, and 90. The data in 1984 were derived from a sample survey of 1,119 people aged 70. In total, 804 individuals (72% participation rate) were extensively investigated at baseline with a medical evaluation including a thorough physical examination; electrocardiogram; and laboratory tests, including hematological, renal, hepatic, and metabolic function tests.19 In addition 734 persons received home visits with interviews about functional ability and social factors. The non participants did not differ significantly from the participants with regard to social and demographic characteristics or to days spent in the hospital for all causes and for five specific diseases.19 To select an initially nondisabled cohort, 29 persons reporting need of help in at least one daily activity (transferring, walking indoors, getting outdoors, walking outside in nice weather, walking outside in poor weather, climbing stairs) were excluded. Of the 705 remaining persons, 573 took part in a clinical oral health examination. These persons constitute the baseline population for the present study. The nondisabled persons who participated only in the other parts of the study and persons who also took part in the oral health study did not differ with regard to sex, social factors, comorbidity, health behavior, and most specific diseases, although more nonparticipants than participants had arteriostenosis (chi-square test, P 5.04). The study population at baseline was thus somewhat selected, healthy, and nondisabled. The participants in the different phases of the longitudinal study form the basis for the analyses on onset of disability. A total of 460 subjects participated in the 5-year follow-up study, 292 in the 10-year follow-up study, 150 in the 15-year follow-up study, and 78 in the 20-year follow-up study. The analyses of mortality at 21-year follow-up are based on all 573 participants in the baseline study (70-year study). The outcome measure, mobility disability, was measured at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year follow-up using the Av-lund Mob-H scale about need for help in the six activities listed above. Persons who could perform all activities without help (maximum score) were distinguished from those who needed help in one or more activities. Mobility disability as measured according to the Mob-H scale is strongly related to physical performance tests 20 and has been tested for construct validity 21 and reliability 22 with satisfactory results. Mortality was measured at 21-year follow-up with information on deaths obtained from the Central National Register. The independent variable was number of teeth, as assessed in a clinical oral examination and categorized as zero, one to nine, 10 to 19, and 20 or more teeth. Covariates were all measured at baseline: Sex. Education (o12 years vs 12 years). Social class. The participants and their spouses were classified according to their last held occupation before retirement into five social classes from 1 (high) to 5 (low) according to the standards of the Danish National Institute of Social Research.23 Persons who had been outside the labor market were classified as 6 (disability pension) or 7 (housewives). The participants were classified by family social class according to the highest-ranking spouse. Income. Low (only compulsory old age pension) vs high (compulsory old age pension plus other income sources). Live alone (yes vs no). Comorbidity. The definitions of specific conditions were as follows: hypertension (already diagnosed and treated with drugs or blood pressure 160/95 mmHg); diabetes mellitus (already diagnosed and treated with drugs or fasting blood value 4125 mg/dL or 2-hour value 170 mg/dL); bronchitis (cough and sputum production on most days for at least 3 months during the previous 2 years); osteoarthritis in lower limbs (range of motion, palpable enlargements, and crepitation of joints), arteriostenosis in lower limbs (symptoms of intermittent claudication, pulselessness, and an ankle–arm index less than 90% as calculated from systolic ankle blood pressure measurement); myocardial infarction (cases verified according to hospital records). Persons were categorized as having zero, one to two, or three or more of the above-mentioned medically diagnosed diseases. Four of these specific diseases (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and arteriostenosis) are known to be specifically related to oral health and mortality and are thus each included as separate variables in the multivariate analyses. Tiredness in daily activities was measured using the Mob-T scale.24 The participants were asked whether they felt tired after performing the same six activities as in the Mob-H scale (persons who did not feel tired vs persons who felt tired in one or more of the activities). Reliability tests on the Mob-T scale showed agreement percentages from 94.3% to 95.3% and kappa values from 0.72 to 0.79 for the included items on intra- and inter-rater tests.22 The construct validity of the two scales was tested using the Rasch model of item analyses.24 Smoking (never vs ex-smokers vs daily smokers). Physical activity. Inactive (hardly any physical activity, mostly sitting, sometimes light activity) vs active (light physical exercise 4 hours a week, moderate exercise 3 hours a week, or hard or very hard exercise regularly). Statistical Analysis The preliminary analyses included bivariate analyses of the associations between number of teeth and onset of disability and mortality, between the covariates and number of teeth, and between the covariates and onset of disability and mortality. The multivariate analyses included variables that were related to both number of teeth and to disability and mortality (Po.05) in the bivariate analyses. Initially, all analyses were performed by using all categories for number of teeth and the covariates. Then, if the results were in the same direction for some of the categories, they were combined as shown in Table 1. The multivariate analyses included crude analyses of the association between number of teeth and disability and mortality and adjustment by the covariates using forward selection. The SAS procedure LOGISTIC was used for all logistic regression analyses (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). The survival functions for the single variables were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and curves were compared using log-rank tests. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to examine number of teeth with subsequent 21-year mortality risk. RESULTS Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 70-year-old study participants. More than 40% were edentulous, and fewer than 20% had 20 teeth or more. More women than men were in the lower social classes, had low income, and lived alone, whereas more men than women had a myocardial infarction and were smokers. Table 2 shows the proportion of men and women at age 70 in relation to onset of disability at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20- year follow-up and mortality at 21-year follow-up. More men than women had sustained no disability, whereas more women survived. Onset of Disability Table 3 shows the crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for onset of disability by number of teeth at age 70 using logistic regression analysis. The crude analysis showed that edentulous persons had a significantly larger OR of onset of disability at 5-year follow-up than persons with 20 or more teeth (OR 5 3.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5 1.54–9.31). The estimates were somewhat attenuated when adjusted by the baseline covariates but remained marginally significant (OR 5 2.81, 95% CI 5 0.98–8.03). The corresponding crude ORs for 70-year-olds with one to nine remaining natural teeth was 2.67 (95% CI 5 0.98–7.25). This estimate became insignificant in the adjusted analysis (OR 5 2.13, 95% CI 5 0.67–6.74). The crude analysis showed strong and statistically significant associations between having no teeth or one to nine remaining teeth and onset of disability at 10-year follow-up (OR 5 2.11, 95% CI 5 1.03–4.29 and OR 5 3.07, 95% CI 5 1.38–6.84, respectively). Education, arteriostenosis, and physical activity at baseline attenuated the association between having no teeth and onset of disability in the final adjusted model, whereas the association between having one to nine teeth and onset of disability remained unchanged in the adjusted analysis. Number of teeth at age 70 was not related to onset of disability at 15- and 20-year follow-up. Mortality At 21-year follow-up, 458 persons had died, and 115 were still alive. Figure 1A and B show the results of Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival functions over 21 years. The persons who were completely toothless differed from those with teeth (Figure 1A), while whether persons had few or many teeth did not have a large effect on mortality (Figure 1B). Figure 1A thus shows that 70-year-old persons with no teeth were at significantly higher risk of mortality 21 years later than dentate persons. When the analyses were stratified according to sex, the same pattern of associations was found for men and women (not shown). The bivariate analyses were likewise studied using the survival functions (not shown). The result was that persons who had less than 12 years of education and low income, felt tired, had one or more diseases, had a myocardial infarction, had arteriostenosis, and were ex-smokers or daily smokers had a greater risk of dying. Consequently, these variables were included in the multivariate Cox regression analyses (Table 4). The crude hazard ratio (HR) for 21-year mortality by edentulism was 1.60 (95% CI 5 1.33–1.92). The estimate was only slightly attenuated when adjusted for the covariates but stayed significant in the final model (HR 5 1.26, 95% CI 5 1.03–1.55). DISCUSSION The primary findings of the present study are that having no or few remaining natural teeth are related to onset of disability at 5- and 10-year follow-up and that being edentulous is related to mortality at 21-year follow-up in a nondisabled 70-year-old population, also when adjusted by the baseline covariates. Overall, the covariates somewhat attenuated the associations between tooth loss and onset of disability and mortality. Health-related variables and education attenuated the association between tooth loss and onset of dis-ability at 5- and 10-year follow-up, but the association remained strong in the final adjusted models. These findings indicate that, although diseases and social factors pick up some of the association, tooth loss itself is a marker of functional decline independent of systemic diseases and socioeconomic factors. There was no association between tooth loss and onset of disability at 15- and 20-year follow-up, suggesting that individuals who would have shown such a relationship may not have survived as readily to age 85 and 90. A well-known problem with regard to analysis of longitudinal data in older populations is selection due to loss at follow-up because of death or nonparticipation for other reasons. Thus, in the analysis of onset of disability over time in the oldest-old, attrition may have resulted in selection bias or attenuation of the association between the determinant and the outcome measure at 15- and 20-year follow-up. The relationship between tooth loss and mortality showed that edentulousness was related to mortality even at 21-year follow-up. The estimates were somewhat attenuated when adjusted for socioeconomic factors, tiredness in daily activities, comorbidity, arteriostenosis, and smoking but remained strong and statistically significant in the final adjusted model. There are several possible explanations for these findings. The present findings are in agreement with a longitudinal Swedish study that reported that tooth loss was associated with mortality and in which socioeconomic factors could not explain the association.18 However, although it is possible that socioeconomic factors throughout the life course explain some of the effects of having no or few teeth at age 70 on mortality. Several studies have shown that social position in old age may be measured using several different indicators occurring at different times over the life course (e.g.,15,25). However, the association between tooth loss and mortality was not substantially attenuated when adjusted for education, representing social exposure in early life; family social class, representing social exposure during working life; and income, representing social position at age 70. Still, it is possible that the measures used were too rough to capture life course social influences on loss of teeth. It is also possible that health behaviors may explain the findings. It is well established that health behaviors (e.g., smoking and alcohol consumption)26–28 and use of dental services 29 are related to tooth loss. However, the association between edentulism and mortality did not disappear when adjusting the estimates for smoking. Unfortunately, data on smoking and oral health behavior throughout life were not available. It is possible that these factors might explain some of the results in the present study. Furthermore, it is possible that periodontal inflammation may explain the association between edentulism and mortality. There is strong evidence from large longitudinal studies that periodontal inflammation and tooth loss are both associated with greater risk of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and mortality (e.g.,3,6,7). Although teeth in children and young adults might have been lost primarily because of caries, several studies have suggested that periodontal inflammation may be a major cause of tooth loss later in life.3,10,30 Periodontal attachment loss has been identified as a significant risk factor for tooth loss (e.g.,31–33). A German study reported that periodontal disease was the most frequent cause of tooth extraction for people aged 40 and older, whereas for those younger than 40, caries and third molar extractions were the most frequent reasons.33 Another study found that teeth constantly surrounded by severe gingival inflammation over a 26-year observation period were at significantly higher risk of being lost than teeth surrounded by inflammation-free gingiva, confirming the role of gingival inflammation as a strong risk factor for tooth loss.34 Studies have also reported that the number of remaining teeth was correlated with circulating levels of systemic inflammatory markers (e.g.,35), suggesting a link between current and past periodontal inflammation and tooth loss. This is in line with the hypothesis that, when teeth are lost because of periodontal disease, the evidence of periodontal inflammation is removed while the systemic damage may partly persist.10 An alternative explanation has been proposed.36 In a group of very old people in Finland, higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were found in edentulous people than in those with 20 teeth or more. Based on these findings, it was suggested that denture-related oral mucosal lesions might be important determinants of high CRP in edentulous people, comparable with periodontal inflammation in dentate subjects. Unfortunately, because data on periodontal inflammation earlier in life were not available, it was not possible to analyze this further. In the interpretation of the findings of the present study, several aspects should be taken into consideration. It is a strength that the analyses of onset of disability are based on a well-validated measure of functional ability,21,22 and that information about mortality is available for all participants from the Central National Register. Another strength is that the measure of diseases is based on a thorough health examination by a physician (KSL). In addition, the measures of dentition status (number of teeth, edentulism) are based on a clinical oral examination. However, it is a weakness that no information about changes in functional ability during the long periods between the follow-up examinations (5 years) is available. In addition, there is a risk of misclassification with regard to the answers of questions about education because of the long time span between the time of education and the time of the study, although there is no reason to believe that this possible misclassification is systematic. Despite these limitations, the study nevertheless represents a uniquely valuable opportunity for analyses of the relationship between tooth loss at age 70 as an early indicator of accelerated aging and subsequent onset of disability and mortality. In conclusion, this study shows that tooth loss is strongly and independently associated with onset of disability and mortality in old age. Although the biological pathway is not obvious, the findings indicate that tooth loss may be an early indicator of accelerated aging. The results suggest the need for further study of these relationships. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was supported by a grant from the Velux Foundation.

Complete Edentulism Prior to the Age of 65 Years is Associated with All-Cause Mortality,"David W. Brown, MScPH, MSc","Purpose: We examine the relationship between complete edentulism prior to the age of 65 years and all-cause mortality after adjustment for socioeconomic characteristics. Methods: Using data from 41,000 adult participants in the 1986 National Health Interview Survey, with mortality follow-up data on each cohort member through December 31, 2002 (16 years follow-up), we estimated the relative odds of all-cause mortality among adults (age>18 years) with complete edentulism prior to the age of 65 years compared with that among those without the condition. Multivariable adjusted logistic regression analyses were repeated for complete edentulism at any age. Results: The age-standardized prevalence of complete edentulism was 12.3 percent [95 percent confidence interval (CI), 12.0-12.6]. Among persons aged<65 years, the risk of death from all causes was 19 percent for persons with complete edentulism compared to 10 percent for persons without. Compared with those without complete tooth loss, the risk of death from all causes was 1.5 (95 percent CI, 1.3-1.7) (P<0.001) times greater for persons with complete edentulism prior to the age of 65 years after multivariable adjustment. Similar results were observed for complete edentulism among persons aged > 65 years. Conclusions: Complete edentulism prior to the age of 65 years was associated with all-cause mortality after multivariable adjustment for several socioeconomic characteristics. These results provide further evidence supporting the notion that poor oral health as evidenced by complete edentulism is an important public health issue across the lifespan. Key Words: tooth loss, mortality, cohort studies","Introduction Poor oral health has been shown to have a negative effect on people’s overall health and quality of life (1,2). Until fairly recently, tooth loss was considered a natural part of the aging process; however, advances in oral health have resulted in decreases in the prevalence of tooth loss in the United States since at least the 1950s (3-5). During 1999-2000, only about 8 percent of US adults were completely edentulous (<1 percent of those aged 20-39 years; 5 percent, 40-59 years; 25 percent, 60 years) (6), whereas in the late 1950s, more than half of US adults aged 65 years or older were edentulous (4 percent of those aged 25-34 years; 10 percent, 35-44 years; 22 percent, 45-54 years; 38 percent, 55-64 years; 54 percent, 65-74 years; 67 percent, 75 years) (7). Despite this decrease in the percentage of Americans with complete edentulism, the absence or loss of all natural teeth, edentulism remains an important public health problem both in the United States and worldwide (2). Edentulism has been associated with an increased risk for systemic chronic disease and death (8-16). The increased death rate among people with tooth loss may in part be because tooth loss is a marker for underlying factors associated with death risk, including behavioral factors, socioeconomic factors, infection, and inflammation (17,18). However, the relationship between tooth loss and mortality independent of socioeconomic characteristics remains unclear (18,19). Moreover, because edentulism most often affects older persons, relationships between edentulism and mortality prior to the age of 65 years is not often considered. Using data from the 1986 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we examined the relationship between self-reported complete edentulism and risk for death (after adjusting for socioeconomic variables) among all adults aged 18 years and, separately, among those aged 18-64 years. Methods The NHIS is a cross-sectional household interview survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States. Data are collected through a personal household interview conducted by interviewers employed and trained by the US Bureau of the Census according to procedures specified by the National Center for Health Statistics. Data are collected from each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia with use of a multistage area probability sampling plan designed to obtain nationally representative estimates. A detailed description of the sampling plan for the 1986 NHIS is provided elsewhere (20), and a full description of the NHIS and its procedures can be obtained online at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis. In 1986, the NHIS questionnaire consisted of basic health and demographic items and questions on current health topics. Participants were asked about their health status, including any health conditions, their health-care utilization, and their health insurance. The 1986 NHIS questionnaire also included a dental health supplement, one question of which asked respondents whether they had lost all their teeth (i.e., whether they had complete edentulism). The validity of self-reported tooth loss compared with clinically derived measures has been examined (21-24) and shown to provide good to excellent estimates. For this analysis, early complete edentulism was defined as self-reported complete edentulism prior to the age of 65 years based on respondents’ age at the time of the interview. To ascertain the vital status of each cohort member through December 31, 2002 (approximately 16 years after the survey), we merged the 1986 NHIS data on survey participants aged 18 years or older at the time they participated in the survey with follow-up mortality data from the National Death Index (NDI), which has been shown to capture 93-98 percent of all US deaths (25-27). Deceased NHIS participants were matched to the NDI by social security number, first and last names, middle initial, race, sex, marital status, birth date (day, month, and year), state of birth, and residence. Eligible NHIS participants with a “true” NDI record match were assumed to be dead, and those with no NDI record match or an NDI record match considered to be “false” were assumed to be alive (28). Follow-up (i.e., survival) time was calculated as the difference between the 1986 NHIS baseline interview date and the last known date alive for NHIS participants listed as decedents in the NDI and as the difference between the interview date and December 31, 2002, for those not listed as decedents. For this analysis, NHIS data and follow-up information were available for 41,000 1986 NHIS participants aged 18 years or older. Of the 62,052 NHIS participants interviewed in 1986, 43,837 were eligible for follow-up, 17,393 were ineligible because they were younger than 18 years old at the time of the interview, and 822 were ineligible because they had insufficient data for matching to the NDI (Figure 1). Of those eligible for follow-up, the NDI showed that 19 percent were deceased, and the other 81 percent were assumed to be alive. An additional 2,837 respondents (645 of whom died during follow-up) were excluded because of missing data for analysis variables, leaving exactly 41,000 of the NHIS respondents for analysis. Compared with survey participants included in the analysis, those who were excluded were more likely to be aged 65 years (21 percent versus 16 percent, P 0.05), less likely to be White (82 percent versus 86 percent, P 0.05), less likely to have at least 12 years of education (26 percent versus 24 percent, P 0.05), and more likely to have an annual income below $20,000 (42 percent versus 38 percent, P 0.05). The crude prevalence of complete edentulism (15 percent versus 10 percent, P 0.05) and the percentage of participants who had died by the end of the follow-up period (22 percent versus 19 percent, P 0.05) were both slightly higher among those excluded from the analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate, by means of the hazard ratio, the relative risk for death associated with early complete edentulism in age-and multivariable-adjusted analyses. Models were repeated for complete edentulism at any age. In addition to age, the multivariable models adjusted for sex, race (White, Black, other), education (<12 years, 12 years), family income (<$20,000, $20,000, unknown), living situation (alone, with others), health insurance (yes, no), dental insurance (yes, no), body mass index [BMI:(weight in pounds x 704.5) (height in inches)2], and the presence of specified conditions (activity limitation, arthritis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lung cancer, any cancer other than lung cancer, asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema). Multivariable-adjusted models were repeated for cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, codes 390-459 for deaths occurring between 1986 and 1998 and by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth revision, codes I00-I99 for deaths occurring between 1999 and 2002. Analyses were conducted with the use of SAS v9.1.3 (2002-2003, SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and sample weights were used to make the NHIS representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized US population. SAS-callable SUDAAN v9.0.1 (2005, Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) was used to account for the NHIS’ complex sampling design (which involved both clustering and stratification) and to obtain accurate variance estimates. We assessed the appropriateness of the proportional hazard assumption for the variables in our final model with log–log survival plots and Schoenfeld residual plots. Ordinary least squares regression was used to assess the relationship between residuals and follow-up time. We also fit the final model to the data in unweighted analyses using Stata v9.2 (2007, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and examined the proportional hazard assumption using the Stata procedure STPHTEST. Without exception, all covariates in the final model satisfied the proportional hazard assumption. Model parameter estimates were computed by maximum likelihood techniques, and 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs) were based on the standard error of the model coefficients. All statistical inferences were based on a significance level of 0.05. Results Overall, 15 percent of the sample was aged 18-24 years; 43 percent, 25-44 years; 26 percent, 45-64 years; 5 percent, 65-69 years; 4 percent, 70-74 years; and 6 percent, 75 years. About half (47 percent) of the sample members were women, 86 percent were White, 11 percent were Black, and 3 percent were of another race. Twenty-four percent of the sample had less than a high school education, 38 percent reported a family income below $20,000, and 18 percent did not have Medicare or private insurance. The estimated age-standardized prevalence of complete edentulism was 12.3 percent (95 percent CI, 12.0-12.6), including 6 percent among those aged 18-64 years, 30 percent among those aged 65-74 years, and 46 percent among those aged 75 years (Table 1). Other respondent characteristics associated with complete edentulism included being female (P = 0.04), having less education (P < 0.001), having lower family income (P < 0.001), lacking health insurance (P < 0.001) or dental insurance coverage (P < 0.001), being underweight, overweight, or obese (compared to normal weight) (P < 0.001), having activity limitation (P < 0.001), and presence of several chronic conditions (diabetes, ischemic heart disease, emphysema; all P < 0.001) (Table 1). Associations between complete edentulism and White race and prevalent hypertension or bronchitis were marginally significant (P = 0.05). For those without selected conditions, the prevalence of complete tooth loss was 13.2-13.7 percent (data not shown). Among persons aged <65 years at their NHIS interview, 801 (2.2 percent) died within 5 years, 1,841 (5.1 percent) died within 10 years, and 3,471 (9.7 percent) died within the 16-year follow-up period. Death during follow-up also occurred among 2,251 (56.4 percent) of the participants aged 65-74 years and 2,125 (84.6 percent) of those aged 75 years. In unadjusted analyses, complete edentulism prior to the age of 65 years was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (Figure 2; Table 2), as was complete edentulism among persons aged 65 years or older (Table 2). Among persons aged <65 years, the risk of death from all causes was 19 percent for persons with complete edentulism compared with 10 percent for persons without (Table 2). After multivariable adjustment for age, sex, race, education, income, living situation, insurance (Medicare or private, Medicaid, private dental), BMI, and comorbidity [activity limitation, arthritis, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer (excluding lung), asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, lung cancer], the risk of death from all causes was estimated to be 1.5 (95 percent CI, 1.3-1.7) (P < 0.001) times greater for persons with complete edentulism prior to the age of 65 years compared with those without. Death from CVDs. Among persons aged <65 years in their NHIS interview, 259 (0.7 percent) died from CVD within 5 years, 607 (1.7 percent) died within 10 years, and 1,160 (3.2 percent) died within the 16-year follow-up period. Death from CVD during follow-up also occurred among 1,053 (26.2 percent) of the participants aged 65-74 years and 1,200 (47.3 percent) of those aged 75 years. Associations between complete edentulism and death from CVD was similar to that described above for all-cause mortality for both persons aged <65 years and those aged 65 years or older (Table 3). Premature All-Cause Mortality. Of the 34,514 respondents aged 64 years or younger at interview, 1,872 died prior to the age of 65 years; these deaths constituted 54 percent (1,872/3,471) of all deaths among respondents in this age group over the 16-year follow-up period. The age-standardized risk of premature death (i.e., death prior to age 65) was 10 percent among respondents with early complete edentulism and 5 percent among those without. The relative risk of premature death among those with early complete edentulism compared with the risk among those without was 1.2 (95 percent CI, 1.0-1.5; P = 0.05) after adjustments for age, sex, race, education, income, living situation, insurance status, and the presence of comorbid conditions. Secondary Analysis. Because it is difficult to postulate why tooth loss might be associated with external causes of death (e.g., unintentional injuries, suicides, homicides, legal intervention, complications of medical or surgical care) that are common among younger persons, multivariable-adjusted regression models were repeated after excluding death from such causes, and findings similar to those shown in Table 2 were observed. Discussion In this large, nationally representative sample of adults, we observed a statistically significant association between complete edentulism prior to the age of 65 years and risk for death during a 16-year follow-up period after adjusting for several sociodemographic variables. Associations were similar for persons aged 65 years or older. We also observed a marginally significant increased risk for premature death associated with early complete edentulism. And, similar to previous work examining associations between tooth loss and CVD (9,12,13,15), we observed modest associations between complete edentulism and CVD mortality among persons with edentulism prior to the age of 65 years as well as among older persons. These findings complement those of other studies that were primarily focused on older populations. In a Danish community-based cohort of adults, Holm-Pedersen and colleagues (8) observed an association between edentulism at the age of 70 years and death over a 21-year follow-up period (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95 percent CI, 1.03-1.55). In a study of 75-year-old men and women residing in three Nordic countries, Osterberg and associates (29) observed significant relationships between the number of teeth remaining and death over a 7-year period of follow-up. In contrast, Tu and colleagues (19) did not observe a significant relationship between edentulism and death during more than 50 years of following the Glasgow alumni cohort of more than 12,000 men and women younger than 30 years at baseline. And, in a Japanese study of men and women aged 80 years or older, Morita and colleagues (30) found edentulism to be associated with death among men but not among women during 10 years of follow-up. The results of this analysis are subject to several limitations. The most important limitation is that the analysis did not control for exposure to cigarette smoking, a risk factor for adult periodontitis and tooth loss (31), because the 1986 NHIS did not collect information about smoking. We attempted to address this challenge by controlling for the presence of several smoking-related conditions (e.g., emphysema, lung cancer, ischemic heart disease). Such use of smoking-related conditions as a proxy for smoking undoubtedly underestimates smoking exposure and is skewed toward cases with more chronic forms of disease (i.e., length-biased sampling). As a result, we may have overestimated the relationship between early complete edentulism and death. Information on diet or poor diet, a risk factor for tooth loss (32), was not available. Also, data used in the analysis, in particular the exposure variable (complete edentulism status), were based on self-report in 1986 only; some NHIS respondents may have become completely edentulous during follow-up and this would not be reflected in the exposure variable. Similarly, information was not available on changes in measures of confounding variables used in the multivariable-adjusted models. Finally, because the 1986 NHIS data did not indicate whether respondents suffered from partial edentulism, we were unable to examine associations between partial edentulism and death. In summary, the results of this analysis showed that complete edentulism prior to the age of 65 years among US adults is associated with an increased risk for death, and thus provides further evidence supporting the notion that poor oral health is an important public health issue. Edentulism reflects a complex pattern of environmental, pathogenic, and socioeconomic conditions (33,34). Although poor oral health disproportionately affects older adults and disadvantaged, vulnerable populations, Americans of all ages and sociodemographic strata are subject to oral health threats. Therefore, health policies might be reoriented to incorporate oral health into general health-promotion strategies (35). In addition, efforts to control oral disease and associated illness might include the provision of primary oral health care in areas where these services are lacking and a continued effort to translate existing knowledge into cost-effective oral health programs (36).",-,"1.

"Missing Teeth Predict Incident Cardiovascular Events, Diabetes, and Death","J.M. Liljestrand, A.S. Havulinna, S. Paju, S. Männistö, V. Salomaa, and P.J. Pussinen","Periodontitis, the main cause of tooth loss in the middle-aged and elderly, associates with the risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease. The objective was to study the capability of the number of missing teeth in predicting incident cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, and all-cause death. The National FINRISK 1997 Study is a Finnish population–based survey of 8,446 subjects with 13 y of follow-up. Dental status was recorded at baseline in a clinical examination by a trained nurse, and information on incident CVD events, diabetes, and death was obtained via national registers. The registered CVD events included coronary heart disease events, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. In Cox regression analyses, having ≥5 teeth missing was associated with 60% to 140% increased hazard for incident coronary heart disease events (P < 0.020) and acute myocardial infarction (P < 0.010). Incident CVD (P < 0.043), diabetes (P < 0.040), and death of any cause (P < 0.019) were associated with ≥9 missing teeth. No association with stroke was observed. Adding information on missing teeth to established risk factors improved risk discrimination of death (P = 0.0128) and provided a statistically significant net reclassification improvement for all studied end points. Even a few missing teeth may indicate an increased risk of CVD, diabetes, or all-cause mortality. When individual risk factors for chronic diseases are assessed, the number of missing teeth could be a useful additional indicator for general medical practitioners.Keywords: periodontitis, tooth extraction, cardiovascular diseases, partially edentulous jaw, edentulous mouth, diabetes mellitus","Introduction Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory destructive disease in the tooth-supportive tissues—that is, the periodontium. It is a bacterial disease, but the eventual tissue destruction results from an interplay between pathogen activity and a subsequent host response. The association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been established, and periodontitis is generally accepted as a CVD risk factor, even though the causality still remains debatable (Desvarieux et al. 2005; Lockhart et al. 2012; Tonetti and Van Dyke 2013). Periodontitis and subsequent systemic inflammation have an additive effect on the development of diabetic complications, probably via exacerbation of insulin resistance (Lalla and Papapanou 2011).Possible mechanisms explaining the link between periodontitis and systemic chronic diseases includes ongoing low-level inflammation and periodontium-originated transient but repeated bacteremia. Inflammation mediators, such as lipopolysaccharide and cytokines, may spread systemically promoting cardiometabolic disorders (Pussinen et al. 2007; Pussinen et al. 2011; Lockhart et al. 2012; Schenkein and Loos 2013; Kallio et al. 2014).In few prospective studies, tooth loss is independently associated with the risk for incident fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD) events (Hung et al. 2004) and diabetes mellitus (DM; Demmer et al. 2008) as well as CVD-related and all-cause mortality (Watt et al. 2012). Thus, we hypothesized that missing teeth reflect an accumulation of oral inflammation to which an individual has experienced throughout his life.The aim of this study was to investigate the power of missing teeth in predicting incident CVD—namely, CHD events, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and stroke, as well as incident DM and all-cause death. Our prospective population-based cohort study utilized 13 y of follow-up data. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the association between missing teeth and various incident cardiovascular events with a large population based on a prospective study design. Many existing studies assessing this issue are cross sectional, use dichotomized groupings, and utilize disease-related mortality rates as the outcome (Ragnarsson et al. 2004; Cabrera et al. 2005; Polzer et al. 2012; Watt et al. 2012).Materials and Methods Baseline This study is based on the National FINRISK 1997 Study, a national population-based cohort (N = 8,446) with subjects 25 to 74 y of age (Vartiainen et al. 2010). The survey methods follow the World Health Organization’s (1988) MONICA proto-col. The subjects filled in a comprehensive questionnaire and participated in a clinical examination, which included weight, height, and blood pressure measurements. The cases with existing CVDs or DM at baseline were identified via 1) the questionnaire as a doctor-diagnosed disease (“Has a doctor ever told you that you have diabetes: yes / no”); 2) record linkage with the disease-associated drug reimbursement records from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland, including pur-chased medications and entitled reimbursements; and 3) record linkage with the National Hospital Discharge register for hospitalizations. In our study, fulfilling any of these identified the subject as having existing CVD or DM. A history of myocardial infarction, revascularizations, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was included in CHD events. Previous stroke, excluding subarachnoid hemorrhage, was included in the existing CVD (Kallio et al. 2014).The number of missing teeth was registered in a clinical examination by a trained nurse. The nurses counted all remaining teeth using a flashlight and a spatula, and they were not especially trained to distinguish natural teeth from, for example, bridge pontics or dental implants. Information on missing teeth was assessed only at baseline, and no follow-up data on tooth loss were available. Presuming that a fully dentate sub-ject has 32 teeth, the population was divided into 5 groups based on the number of missing teeth as follows: 0 to 1 (n = 2,461), 2 to 4 (n = 1,532), 5 to 8 (n = 883), 9 to 31 (n = 1,813), and 32 (edentulous; n = 940). This grouping is designed due to lack of general consensus on appropriate categories of missing teeth. Blood was drawn for laboratory analyses, which were more closely reported earlier (Pussinen et al. 2011). The free-time physical inactivity variable (level 1 on a scale of 1 to 4) and parent with DM/AMI variable (if either parent had AMI/DM before the age of 60 y) were obtained from the questionnaire. In a nutrition subsample of the National FINDIET97 (n= 2,452), information on nutritional intake was collected from the 24-h dietary recall, and we used standard energy densities in the analysis: 37 kJ/g for fat, 17 kJ/g for protein, and 17 kJ/g for carbohydrates (Kallio et al. 2014). All baseline data were collected during 1997. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the National Public Health Institute and con-ducted according to the Helsinki Declaration. All subjects gave an informed consent. This article is structured according to STROBE guidelines for cohort studies.Follow-up The study includes >13 y of follow-up data, with a maximum of 13.9 y and a median of 13.8 y regarding all studied end points. A total of 8,446 subjects participated in the FINRISK97 study. Data on number of teeth was available for 8,142 study participants (Appendix Figure); information on all the covariates was available for 7,862 (total). The methods for diagnos-ing CVD incidence is thoroughly reported earlier (Pajunen et al. 2004).The cases with incident CVDs and DM were identified via 1) the drug reimbursement records from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland, 2) the National Hospital Discharge register for hospitalizations, and 3) the National Causes-of-Death Register as the underlying, direct, or contributing cause of death. The last register was also the source of “all-cause mortality” data.Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS 21.0 and R. When the characteristics across the missing-teeth groups were explored, the adjusted P value was calculated with logistic regression analysis and linear trend with 1-way analysis of variance. Due to skewed distributions, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, and gamma-glutamyl transferase were log10-transformed before significance and linear trend tests were analyzed across the missing-teeth groups. To compare the subjects with and without CVD, P values were calculated with Mann-Whitney U And chi-square tests, as appropriate. Missing values regarding parent with DM (n = 689) and AMI (n = 691) were assumed 0. Subjects with a history of CVD or with DM were excluded from the Cox regression analyses for incident CVD or DM, respectively. Incidences for diseases are reported for a 13-y follow-up, and CVD analyses were adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol (log), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (log), education (3 categories), smoking (yes/no), treated systolic blood pressure (medication within 0-7 d, yes/no), existing DM, and a geographic variable (east/west). The geographic variable was included because it is an important confounder in our population-based sample (Havulinna et al. 2008). Mortality analyses were additionally adjusted for existing CVD. The adjusted covariates were selected to comply with the current general cardiovascular risk profile presented in the Framingham Heart Study (D'Agostino et al. 2008). DM analysis was adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking (yes/no), physical inactivity, parent with DM, C-reactive protein (log), and a geographic variable (east/west). These covariates were selected in concordance with an established Diabetes Risk Score (Lindström and Tuomilehto 2003).The cross-validation subgroup assignment was stratified by sex, 10-y age group, category of missing teeth, and the disease endpoint status in question to ensure proper distribution of these important variables in each cross-validation subgroup. We tested the discriminative ability of the models without and with the information on the number of missing teeth using the C-index, the net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement statistics for CVD, DM, and death. In analyses for categorical and clinical NRI, the subjects were assigned to 4 groups (0% to 5%, 5% to 10%, 10% to 20%, >20%) and 3 groups (0% to 5%, 5% to 20%, >20%), respectively (Tikkanen et al. 2013). For the 13-y absolute risk predictions, we used 10× cross validation to reduce overoptimism. The cross validation was stratified by sex, 10-y age group, disease endpoint status, and the category of missing teeth. Cross-validated (10×) model calibration was tested using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.The socioeconomic status was monitored by years of education, which is considered an optimal parameter of the status in Finnish studies (Laatikainen 2000). The education variable with 3 categories is a modification of the standard 3-leveled education variable, which takes into account the subjects’ age and sex, thus eliminating the bias caused by changes in the education system. This variable is used in the multi adjusted follow-up analyses. We used the function “cox.zph” in R to assess the validity of Cox proportional hazards assumptions, all of which were met. The assumptions were also assessed graphically with log-minus-log plots and Schoenfeld residuals.Results Number of missing teeth at baseline was associated directly with higher levels of several established CVD risk factors, as shown in Table 1. A significant and linear relationship between a risk factor and missing-teeth group was found for age, education years (inverse), body mass index, HDL cholesterol (inverse), triglycerides, C-reactive protein, male sex, existing DM, and either parent having AMI or DM. Systolic blood pressure, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and cholesterol showed no significant trends due to high standard deviation values. Smokers were equally distributed between among teeth groups, with a group-specific prevalence of 40% to 48%. Total intake of energy, carbohydrates, proteins, and fat did not differ significantly across missing-teeth categories when adjusted for age, sex, and education years.We investigated the characteristics of subjects with and without incident CVD and further explored subjects with incident CHD events, AMI, or stroke (Table 2). In sum, 9.9% of the studied population developed incident CVD in the 13-y follow-up. All CVD risk factors were significantly different between subjects with and without incident CVD. Presence of DM was 3.5 times more common in subjects having CVD, of which 70% were men. The risk factors showed similar patterns in the sub-groups of CVD (CHD events, AMI, and stroke; data not shown).Table 3 shows the Cox regression hazard ratios for incident CVD events, DM, and death in the 13-y follow-up for each missing-teeth group, adjusting for covariates. Having 5 to 8 missing teeth increased the hazard for incident CHD events and AMI, which peaked in this category (hazard ratio = 2.39, P = 0.004). The group with 9 to 31 missing teeth provided the largest hazard ratios regarding CVD events and CVDs in general. None of the results for incident stroke were significant. Fully edentulous subjects had smaller hazard ratios for incident CVD and CHD events than did those in the group with 9 to 31 missing teeth. However, edentulous subjects- had the largest hazard ratios for DM and death. The survival plots for CVDs, DM, and death across missing-teeth groups are presented in the Figure.The discrimination and reclassification of individuals after addition of missing-teeth groups to established risk profiles for incident CVD events, DM, and death stratified by 10-y age groups are shown in Table 4. The clinical NRI was significantly positive for all end points investigated using Cox regression models with age as the time scale. The clinical NRI was calculated with reclassification among those participants who were classified to the intermediate risk group (5% to 20%) by the model using only established risk factors. The difference in c-statistics was statistically significant regarding all-cause mortality (0.0027, P = 0.0100). All models were properly calibrated for absolute prediction (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, P > 0.05).Discussion In this prospective cohort study of a population-based sample of Finnish adults, we show that the number of missing teeth at baseline associates with incident CVD, CHD events, AMI, DM, and death after adjustment for covariates. The presented hazards for CVD and DM are adjusted for selected covariates, which comply with the current Framingham general cardiovascular risk profile and the Diabetes Risk Score, respectively (Lindström and Tuomilehto 2003; D'Agostino et al. 2008). Adding information of missing teeth to the traditional risk profile moderately improved the cross-validated risk prediction regarding all-cause mortality.Our main hypothesis is that advanced tooth loss somewhat reflects a past accumulation of oral inflammation, and it appears that missing teeth may be a contributing factor in determining cardiovascular risk. The 2 foremost reasons for loss of teeth are caries and periodontitis. Caries has been reported as the main cause for tooth extractions in the British adult population and generally as the main cause at the individual level, while periodontitis has been proposed to be the leading cause for tooth extractions at the tooth level (Phipps and Stevens 1995; Richards et al. 2005). Periodontitis has been claimed to be the world’s most common cause for extracting teeth in subjects >40 y of age (Reich and Hiller 1993; Phipps and Stevens 1995; Agerholm 2001; Gomes et al. 2012). Missing teeth has been proposed as a surrogate marker for periodontitis (Desvarieux et al. 2003; Holmlund and Lind 2012), and it is easily accessible information compared to diagnosis of periodontitis, which relies on clinical examinations and radiographic analysis by a dentist. A comprehensive review by Polzer et al. (2012) and large prospective cohort studies by Watt et al. (2012) and Schwahn et al. (2013) suggested causation between missing teeth and circulatory mortality, while all-cause mortality still lacks sufficient evidence. Recently, Wiener and Sambamoorthi (2014) concluded a significant independent association between self-reported missing teeth values and CVD in a rather large (N = 275,424) cross-sectional study setup. Also Cabrera et al. (2005) found an association between missing teeth and all-cause mortality among 1,462 studied women with 24 y of follow-up. Our study further strengthens this evidence, especially since adding information on missing teeth to established risk factors significantly improved the risk discrimination of death.Tooth loss or missing teeth have been used as a marker of past and present periodontal status in a large number of cross-sectional studies concerning CVD. The studies that measure the association between missing teeth and signs of CVD—such as coronary atherosclerotic burden with coronary angiography, carotid ultrasound, arterial stiffness, or self-reported angina pectoris—support our results (Desvarieux et al. 2003; Desvarieux et al. 2005; Gomes et al. 2012; Holmlund and Lind 2012; Medina-Solis et al. 2014; Asai et al. 2015). Presently, we analyzed the association between missing teeth and various incident cardiovascular events, while most studies have used mortality rates as the outcome (Ragnarsson et al. 2004; Cabrera et al. 2005; Polzer et al. 2012; Watt et al. 2012). Record linkage through national registers has proven to be a reasonably valid indicator for detecting incident CHD events (Pajunen et al. 2005).Some of the earlier studies use self-reported values for missing teeth (Holmlund and Lind 2012; Medina-Solis et al. 2014; Wiener and Sambamoorthi 2014). In earlier reports, study groups have been typically dichotomized—for example, into dentate/edentate or having <10 or <20 teeth; alternatively, they have used the number of teeth as a continuous variable (Polzer et al. 2012). In this study, we used the division into missing-teeth groups due to lack of general consensus. Of course, the causes of missing teeth overlap across groups, but hypothetical cause grouping may aid in the interpretation of results: The first group, with 0 to 1 missing teeth, represents periodontally healthy subjects (controls); the group with 2 to 4 missing teeth is likely explained by lack of or extractions of third molars; those missing 5 to 8 teeth may have additionally lost them due to orthodontic reasons, periodontitis, or caries (Phipps and Stevens 1995; Gomes et al. 2012); and those with 9 to 31 missing teeth most likely suffer from chronic periodontitis. The 2 groups with most missing teeth may represent ongoing or treated advanced oral disease with possible systemic inflammatory burden. It is noteworthy that tooth extraction practices might vary internationally. Thus, missing teeth might not relate to periodontitis similarly in all populations. Missing teeth is a somewhat difficult epidemiologic biomarker because it could reflect severe disease, treated periodontitis, or both (Cabrera et al. 2005). Edentulousness represents an unusual end stage of the disease, eliminating all clinical evidence of ongoing inflammation, even though the systemic damage may be irreversible and evident (Hujoel et al. 2001).We observed a peak in the AMI incidence in the group with 5 to 8 missing teeth, and a CVD incidence peak in the group with 9 to 31 missing teeth at baseline. Due to the magnitude of tooth loss, we hypothesize that these subjects suffer from chronic periodontitis. This hypothesis and curvilinear association are supported by earlier findings (Desvarieux et al. 2003; Pussinen et al. 2003). The subjects with few remaining teeth may have attenuated mastication, which could lead to healthier nutritional intake (Geissler et al. 1984; Schwahn et al. 2013). However, no significant difference in nutritional intake was observed across missing-teeth groups in the subpopulation of the present study after adjusting for age, sex, and education years. Interestingly, edentulous subjects had the largest hazards for all-cause death and DM but not for CVD. This finding challenges the proposed dose-response relationship and shifts the attention toward existing compromised dentition (Holmlund and Lind 2012).The link between periodontitis and DM may be bidirectional (Lalla and Papapanou 2011). The severity of periodontitis seems to worsen glycemic control via induction of systemic inflammation (Taylor et al. 1996). DM impairs repair of periodontitis-induced tissue destruction and may lead to a hyperinflammatory response to the pathogen load (Lalla and Papapanou 2011). Limited information is available on incident DM of individuals without DM at baseline (Demmer et al. 2008; Ide et al. 2011). Demmer et al. (2008) showed in the NHANES I, with 17 y of mean follow-up, that the 3 highest quintiles of periodontitis severity were associated with the risk of DM. In dentate individuals, advanced tooth loss (25 to 31 missing teeth) was associated with incident DM when compared to those with 0 to 8 missing teeth (odds ratio = 1.70, P < 0.05). The hazards in our study were in the same level, but the increased risk was obvious already with ≥5 missing teeth.The strengths of this study are a large population, long and complete follow-up, and known risk factors for multivariate adjustments. The most important limitation is lack of reasons or diagnosis for tooth extractions. Data on eventual prosthodontics or position of remaining teeth, which would have given insight into the masticatory ability, were not available. Also, no follow-up data on missing teeth were available. We did not separate ischemic from hemorrhagic strokes, which would have been beneficial due to the different etiologies of these subtypes. Residual confounding is present because tooth loss is likely to be correlated with various lifestyle and behavioral factors that affect health outcomes. The 24-h dietary recall is not an optimal way of measuring individual nutritional intake. Misclassification is possible in recording of missing teeth due to fixed prosthodontics or residual roots. Finally, our study setup is not suited to explore causality between missing teeth and the end points, merely associations.Conclusions The associations between oral diseases and general health have lately attracted attention, and the World Health Organization has acknowledged oral health care’s importance in preventing fatal chronic diseases (Petersen and Yamamoto 2005). The number of missing teeth, which has been proposed as a surrogate marker for current or past periodontitis, may indicate an increased risk for CVD, DM, and all-cause mortality, and it could be added into existing cardiovascular risk profiles as an additional risk factor. In the light of these findings and the relative ease in counting natural teeth, the number of missing teeth could be a useful indicator for general medical practitioners to refer their patients for further medical evaluation.Author Contributions JAM.

Sociodemographic factors associated with the dental health of persons with diabetes in France,"Sylvie Azogui-Lévy, DDS, PhD; Rosemary Dray-Spira, MD, PhD","This paper describes and compares theoral health status among people withand without diabetes in France, and ana-lyzes the related socioeconomic factors.The study is based on data from thecross-sectional national health surveyconducted in France from 2002 to 2003,which included 19,231 people over 35years of age, among whom 1,111reported having diabetes. Data were col-lected through interviews that inquiredabout oral health status and use ofdental care services, income, educa-tional level, health insurance, place ofresidence, and birthplace.The prevalence of oral health prob-lems was higher among subjects whohad diabetes, compared with those whowere nondiabetic (16.4% vs. 13.4%).Dental care utilization during the surveyperiod was reported to be 8.7% amongsubjects who were diabetic versus12.9% among those who were nondia-betic. The subjects with diabetes weremore likely to have dental problems (OR 1.47, CI 1.03–2.08) and wearremovable dentures (partial and com-plete) when their income was lower (OR 2.17, CI 1.52–3.10). Therewere social inequalities in oral healthamong people with diabetes in Franceaccording to income level. KEY WORDS: access/barriers tocare; diabetes mellitus; epidemiology","Introduction Diabetes is an increasingly common chronic health disorder.1 The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (92% of all diabetes) was 4.57% in France in 2006 and affected some 2.7 million people.2 Social inequalities have been reported in the disease management of people with diabetes. People with higher educational levels receive better healthcare management, with more frequent systematic annual screenings for problems associated with the retina, kidneys, and neuropathic changes.3-7Some studies8,9 have shown that the diabetic care programs organized with standardized management procedures are associated with better control of the disease. The complications associated with poorly controlled diabetes include dental problems, particularly periodontal disease.10-15 Poorer periodontal health has been observed in people with diabetes compared to people without diabetes,11n the risk of alveolar bone loss is four times higher for those with diabetes,including a significantly higher proportion of patients who are edentulous.12 Similar to the most common oral health disorders (dental caries and periodontal disease), diabetes follows a social gradient. Social inequalities observed in oral health concern both disease occurrence and access to care.16 Socially deprived people have more barriers to care and so have poorer oral health status, more missing teeth,17,18 and higher rates of periodontal disease.19,20In France,according to the French Health, HealthCare and Insurance National Survey(ESPS),21 no access to care concerned dental care in more than half of the cases; non access increases the risk of poor oral health status. In France, few studies have focused on dental health and access to care for people with diabetes. Analysis of a national sample in 2007 of people with diabetes found that 38% of these people had received dental care.22 The factors associated with the oral health status of people with diabetes have been studied less frequently. An Analysis of these factors may help to develop ways to improve their health status as well as the monitoring of their disease. Because of the chronic nature of diabetes, people with diabetes in France Are integrated into a care system with recommendations for monitoring their health, including an annual visit to the dentist. They are also better informed on the resources for care. Diabetes is a long-term disorder and the costs of medical treatment are fully covered by the national health insurance. These treatments include dental care for caries, scaling,and extractions. Fixed and removable dental prostheses are excluded, but can be covered by buying additional private insurance.The French national survey on health status and health care use carried out in 2002–2003 offered an opportunity to explore the health status and dental care use of people with and without diabetes in a representative sample of the French Population, and to assess the impact of socioeconomic factors on oral health and dental care.Materials and methods Study population The study is based on data collected during the 2002–2003 national health survey conducted by INSEE (French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies). Its aim was to describe the health of the French population in terms of self-reported disease prevalence and health care use. This Cross-sectional study is repeated every 10 years and uses a random sample based on a database generated by the latest French population census. Each home was considered a household and homes were selected randomly and stratified by region and urban size. The weighted sample was recruited in five waves from October 2002 to October 2003.23The Sample is representative of ordinary households, and all household members were questioned. The 2002–2003 survey utilized three visits over a period of 8 weeks. The medical and social coveragedata were collected during face-to-face interviews, while data regarding healthcare behavior and quality of life were collected using a self-administered questionnaire given to each household member over the age of 18 after the first visit. The National Ethics Committee Gave its approval to use the data for this study. The response rate for the three visits was 77.8%. The data set included 23,070 people over the age of 18 living in mainland France, who had responded to the three visits and who had returned usable self-administered questionnaire.However, for this paper, data from people between the ages of 18 and 34 were excluded, because of the low rate of diabetes in this age group. Hence, our study included 19,231 people who had participated in all three survey visits. There Were two inclusion criteria: 1) identifying diabetes in the list of self-reported health disorders on the questionnaire and 2) taking at least one antidiabetic medication (oral antidiabetics or insulin)during the survey period. Pregnant Women were also excluded from the diabetic population in order to exclude gestational diabetes. Thus, out of the 19,231 participants, 1,111 people were identified as having diabetes according to the two inclusion criteria, while 18,120 were found to be non diabetics.Data Measurements of oral health status in the survey Oral health status was evaluated based on two questions asked at the first visit:1. Are you affected by one of the following dental problems: untreated tooth decay, periodontal attachment loss, frequent dental abscesses?2. Do you have any fixed tooth restorations (bridge, crown, etc.) or removable dentures (partial or complete)?Measurement of dental care use The utilization of dental care was studied using information collected at the secondand third survey visits. If dental care had been sought between these visits, the questionnaire asked about the reasons for consulting a dentist, and the type of care received.Description of the dependantvariables1.Dental problem: The small number of responses to the question about dental health status led us to create a synthetic variable called “dental problem” from the yes/no response to the first question. It was considered as a synthetic indicator of oral health status that included dental caries,periodontal attachment loss, and frequent dental abscesses.2.Dental care use was based on two variables:a. Wearing a dental prosthesis.Wearing a prosthesis (at least one fixed or removable prosthesis) was used as an indicator of having utilized dental services. To wear a prosthesis is a proxy measure of access to care. The type of prosthesis (fixed or removable) was also evaluated. This information was particularly discriminating in the analysis of social inequalities in the utilization of dental care services.b. Subjects’ answer to the question of whether they had “seen the dentist at least once” during the 8-week period of the three survey visits.Variables of interest The following socio demographic variables were collected: age, gender,educational level, household income level, place of residence (according to the size of the urban unit), birthplace, and additionally whether the subject had private health insurance.Income was an estimate of financial capacity and this factor was particularly discrimination for having dental prostheses, which are not covered by the national health insurance. Educational Level was an indicator of capacity to mobilize knowledge to appraise dental health messages and to seek care that was offered. We also recorded the level of health insurance coverage, a determining factor in financing any oral care cost not covered by the national health insurance.Place of residence was recorded to estimate the possible impact of the density of dental offices. Subjects’ birthplacecould have an effect on the prevalence ofdiabetes and on the knowledge of avail-able resources of care.Three age groups were definedaccording to our distribution and othernational studies21that have chosen thesame age groups. We included the mainage groups for wearing prostheses as:35–49 years, 50–69 years, and 70years. Income was defined as annualincome per household unit for this study.This variable was split into quartiles andthe values were grouped into two cate-gories: above and below the median(13,333 Euros).Education level was defined by thehighest academic qualification obtainedand divided into three levels: low (noqualification and primary school only),intermediate (junior secondary, or anapprenticeship), and senior (high schooland above). According to their birth-place, subjects were classified asnonmigrant, European migrant, andother migrant. Place of residence wasdesignated as one of four groups: rural orurban population of less than 5,000 resi-dents; urban population between 5,000and 20,000 residents; urban populationbetween 20,000 and 200,000; and urbanpopulation of more than 200,000 orliving in Paris. Having additional insur-ance was assigned to one of three groups:no additional health insurance, full addi-tional health insurance for disadvantagedpeople or other private health insurance,and no response (n 59).Tobacco use at the time of the surveywas assigned to one of three groups:nonsmoker, current smoker, and noresponse (n 3,075). Alcohol use wasassigned to one of four groups: never toone to three times per month, one tofour times per week, five times per weekor more, and no response (n 3,226).Obesity was assigned to two groups onthe basis of body mass index (BMI(values calculated from weight and height(BMI [kg/m2] weight/height2): notobese was 30 and obese was 30.Perception of general health status wasalso evaluated to estimate the relativeimportance of oral health status, whichwas then classified as excellent/verygood/good, and moderate/poor.Statistical analysisWe described characteristics of the studypopulation: subjects with diabetes andthose without diabetes. We analyzed theoral health status and dental care useonly of subjects with diabetes. Weightingwas applied in the descriptive phases ofthe analysis so that the distributions ofthe indicators of interest presented couldbe extrapolated to the whole of theFrench population. The first step was thebivariate analysis (Pearson’s Chi-square)of the prevalence of oral problems andprosthesis treatment and the variousindividual characteristics (covariates ofinterest). The second step was a stepwiselogistic regression analysis. Gender andage were included in the multivariateanalysis; other covariates were selected ifthe p value of Pearson’s Chi-square wasless than or equal to .05. For oral healthproblems and wearing prostheses,income, complementary insurance, andbirthplace were selected. Smoking andobesity were also selected for oral healthproblems. Level of education wasincluded in a first model because it is arelevant variable in the study of inequali-ties in health, but among people withdiabetes, this variable was not significant.Income and level of education weretested for interaction.Logistic regression models were usedto assess the relationship of risk factorswith each indicator of oral health thatwas tested. Crude and adjusted oddsratios (ORs) were calculated for each riskfactor of interest, including sociodemo-graphic characteristics and lifeconditions.The analyses were carried out usingStata 10®software (StataCorp, CollegeStation, TX, USA).ResultsCharacteristics of the studypopulationThe proportion of subjects with self-reported diabetes was 5.8% (n 1,111,Table 1). Subjects with diabetes wereolder (median age 66 years vs. 52 yearsfor subjects without diabetes) andincluded slightly more men than women(51%). Subjects with diabetes were morelikely to have a lower educational level(71% vs. 44% for subjects without dia-betes) and an income below the median(58% vs. 48%). Subjects with diabeteshad additional insurance coverage in87% of the cases compared to 90% forsubjects without diabetes. Immigrantsaccounted for 14% of subjects with dia-betes, while it was 10% of the subjectswithout diabetes. People with diabeteswere more often obese (35% vs. 12%).The proportion of nonsmokers was simi-lar in both groups. The proportion ofsubjects consuming alcohol at least fivetimes a week was about 20% in bothgroups. Regarding general health, 40% ofthe subjects with diabetes perceived theirhealth status as poor or moderate, versus15% of the subjects without diabetes.Oral health status and dentalcare use according to diabeticstatusThe subjects with diabetes were morelikely to report “at least one dental prob-lem” (17% vs. 14%; p .03, Table 2);they also reported more periodontalattachment loss (10% vs. 7%; p .05;data not shown). Among the subjectswith diabetes, 58% wore a prosthesis.There were differences with the subjectswithout diabetes in the type of prosthesisused: among those who wore a prosthe-sis, 62% of subjects with diabetes had aremovable denture (complete or partialdenture), compared to 33% of nondiabet-ics (p .001). Dental care use duringthe survey period was reported by 9% ofthe subjects with diabetes, compared to13% of subjects without diabetes (p .05).Factors associated with oralhealth status and wearingprostheses among people withdiabetes (Tables 3 and 4)Among people with diabetes, the factorsassociated with having “at least onedental problem” were age (the oldestsubjects reported the fewest problems),birthplace (migrants reported the mostproblems, irrespective of their country oforigin), and income. After adjustment,income remained statistically significantlyassociated with oral health status. Thepeople with diabetes reported more dentalproblems when their income was belowthe median (19.2% vs. 12.6%; aOR 1.47; 95% CI: [1.03–2.08]; Table 3).Analysis of the data showed thatwearing prostheses among subjects withdiabetes was associated with age, gender, and income. The incidence of wearing aprosthesis increased significantly withage, and women were found to be morelikely to wear prostheses. Subjects whowore prostheses were in the higherincome group (62.2% vs. 54.8%; aOR .71; 95% CI: [.55–.92]). The type ofprosthesis worn did not differ by gender,and removable prostheses were morecommon in the oldest age group. Incomeremained significantly associated afteradjustment. Among subjects with dia-betes, wearing a removable prosthesiswas significantly associated with incomebelow the median (69% vs. 52%), andthese subjects were twice as likely towear a removable prosthesis as a fixedone (aOR 2.17; 95% CI: [1.52–3.10];Table 4).DiscussionThis study of a large national sample ofthe French population is the first toaddress the factors associated with oralhealth status and dental care use amongpersons with diabetes. We found agreater prevalence of oral health prob-lems among people with diabetes. Also,there was a predominance of removableprostheses being used by people withdiabetes. In this study, we found that lowincome was associated with a higher rateof dental problems and less use of dentalprostheses. The survey revealed socialinequalities in the dental health status ofpersons with diabetes and less utilizationof care in those persons in the lowersocioeconomic group.Validity of resultsOur findings are consistent with thoseusually reported about people with dia-betes1and are relevant, considering thedata were derived from a nationalsample. However, the problems are prob-ably underestimated, given the limits ofself-reported data.2The number of lostteeth that had not been replaced was notreported, yet this parameter is often usedas a measure of oral health status andaccess to prosthetic care.18,24Because ofthe small sample size of people with dia-betes, the modalities and motives ofconsultation were not investigated. Likewise, the number of people with dia-betes who were seeking care during thesurvey period was too small (n 97) forus to undertake a meaningful analysis ofthe results for access to care.The proportion of people with dia-betes in our sample was slightly higherthan the estimates made by other surveysin France (5.8% and 4.57%),2,4,5whichrelied essentially on data for the con-sumption of antidiabetic medication orbiological analyses. Our study was basedon medication use and self-reported dia-betes. Hence, calculating the number ofpeople with diabetes from drug con-sumption records can underestimateprevalence. Some people who are at thebeginning of the disease (called “predia-betes”) may follow only dietary rules.The rate of adults with undiagnosed dia-betes may be higher among persons withlower education levels. This suggests thatself-reported cases of diabetes mayunder-represent the milder cases, i.e.,those either diagnosed or diagnosed but under-reported, especially among people with a lower level of education.Consequently, the impact of socioeconomic factors measured within adults with diagnosed diabetes may be more marked than in the whole population of people with diabetes. Mean age and gender ratio were the same as those found in national surveys conducted among the diabetic population.5 Dental health status and prosthesis wearing among people with diabetes The greater frequency of oral problems reported among people with diabetes is consistent with the abundant literature on the relationship between poor periodontal health status and diabetes.10-15 The latest national survey 25 on the prevalence of periodontal disease estimated that it was at least 10% for severe forms and 30% for moderate forms, with a higher rate among people with diabetes.14A survey conducted by URCAMˆIle-de-France 26 Among insurance holders with diabetes, which included a clinical examination, showed that 26% had at least one carious tooth, 45% had gingival inflammation, 27% had a loose tooth, and 59% had a lost tooth that had not been replaced. Dental health has improved in recent years in France Among children, owing to the generalized spread of fluoridated toothpastes, dental health messages, and promotional campaigns. However, these efforts have been made only in the last 20 years and have not greatly benefited the current diabetic population. In addition, episodes of poor blood glucose control are frequent throughout a lifetime, and it has been shown 10 that these are detrimental to oral health, particularly periodontal health. When we analyzed the impact of income on oral problems among people with diabetes, the proportion of oral health problems was found to be greater among those with lower incomes. The Severe forms of periodontal disease were observed among socially deprived patients and in persons with unmanaged diabetes.27The combination of these two risk factors can induce a poor dental status. A study carried out in Pakistan 28 Compared periodontal health with socioeconomic status in persons with and without diabetes. Signs of severe periodontal disease were more marked inpatients with unmanaged diabetes, who also had a lower socioeconomic status.The most frequent oral problems (caries and periodontal disease) were closely correlated with oral hygiene habits formed at an early age. People with lower incomes had poorer oral health status that did not improve over time, especially as the type of oral health care provided was rarely preventive.16 Compared with people without diabetes;people with diabetes were more likely to wear a removable prosthesis. Two Hypotheses might explain this observation. First, multiple loose teeth may limit therapeutic choices and make these individuals dependent on blood sugar balance. Second, the high cost of fixed prostheses makes them less accessible for people with lower incomes. We have shown that income is a factor associated with wearing prosthesis, and to a greater degree for fixed prostheses. Fixed prostheses are more costly and their coverage by the national health insurance in France is low (10%–30% of the cost,according to the technique); additionally,private health insurance coverage depends on the type of contract, but is mostly similar to that of national health insurance. The URCA ˆIle-de-France survey 26 showed that the most frequent type of care given to people with diabetes was extractions, and 28% of the patients with diabetes examined forewent dental care, in 85% of cases for prostheses. This Suggests that after extractions, most people with diabetes do not have a prosthetic treatment, due to financial problems. Other studies 29,30 have shown that fixed prostheses are prescribed more often for people with lower risk of oral and periodontal health problems, but not for those with numerous missing teeth,people living in rural areas, those over the age of 45, and those with the lowest incomes. Tooth extraction can reflect poor oral health, or its consequences, individuals with low socioeconomic status. These results also reflect the choice made by these people to have teeth extracted when they are faced with the financial and technical implications of more complex treatment.Income is the main associated factors in people with diabetes, and it is determined by the financial capacity to pay the out-of-pocket costs not covered by national health insurance. In most of studies,16the main factors associated with poor oral health status and poor access to dental care were complementary health insurance and education level. In this study of people with diabetes, these factors are only weakly correlated. This unexpected lack of association with level of education can be explained in different ways. Among People with diabetes, we did not find strong association between health behavior and dental problems. The proportion of persons with a lower education level among people with diabetes was higher than in people without diabetes; therefore, the sample is more homogeneous.There was also evidence that education level influence people’s health behavior.Education level is stable during adulthood and affects dental health behavior.People with diabetes had a lower level of education, which thus resulted in poorer mental health. It seems that the most important factor is to replace tooth loss with prosthesis, and for patients to have the financial capacity to afford this treatment. There is a challenge between education level and income: education level tests the perception of health and income the financial capacity to accesscare. It is likely that more comprehensive health insurance and the integration of people with diabetes into a care system would allow easier access to dental care,and so explain the importance of income alone and the low impact of complementary health insurance as a factor associated with wearing a prosthesis. The Diabetic managed care monitoring programs have shown that socioeconomic disparities persist for visits to specialists(ophthalmology and dentistry) and depend on income levels because of the extra costs that these visits incur.31 Our study only partially estimated utilization of care, because we studied only the period of the survey. People With diabetes sought care less frequently than those without diabetes. This was unexpected for two reasons: first, the latest national guidelines 32 for people with diabetes specify an annual visit to the dentist, and second, general compulsory health insurance benefits fully cover the basic costs of healthcare, including dental care. Possible confusion or ignorance of the existence of two categories of costs for dental care (restorative dentistry is fully reimbursed, while prostheses and periodontal treatment are not fully covered), and the near nonexistence of hospital oral health services may explain this low rate of dental care utilization. The economic analysis of care for people with diabetes in France 33 Shows that dental costs represent 1% of total costs (4.3% for medicine and 26.8%for pharmacy); yet more than 18% of patients reported that they had not utilized care related to their diabetes because of its cost: 9% for dental prostheses and 6% for other dental care.In a study of 1,590 people with diabetes in the United States, Macek et al.34 showed that subjects had less access to dentists than to other medical practitioners. The authors suggest that the link between diabetes and periodontal disease is not well known to patients, and the financial obstacles to care are higher because of lower income and because dental care is given a low priority in expenditures. Other medical visits (eyes and feet) were followed more closely, as compliance was easier as these services can be integrated into an overall care package (e.g., in a hospital), unlike oral health care.More generally, irrespective of diabetic status, dental health is socially determined.18,24 These social differences can be explained not only by differences in exposure to risk factors and in behavior (with respect to hygiene and diet),but also by disparities in access to care,income, and education. Treating dental problems presupposes recognition of needs by individuals and a capacity to seek treatment. The characteristics of the person, oral health attitudes, and knowledge (approach to prevention and care,source of care, etc.) are important in this regard. Dental problems, and more specifically loss of teeth, are the result of accumulated dental health disorders and fragmented access to oral health care.However, low income alone is not the cause. It is also possible that a feeling of not having control over the disease and its treatment becomes stronger as social support is weaker, and leads to dental care deprivation.24 Conclusion This study supports the hypothesis that socioeconomic characteristics can have an impact on people with diabetes, their oral health status, and their access to care. We believe that better complementary insurance coverage for dental treatment and disease management,including dental care, could reduce dental health disparities of persons with diabetes in France.Acknowledgements The authors acknowledge Jean-LouisLanoé and Julie Gourmelen for their cooperation and statistical advice.",-,"1.Grimaldi A.

"Diabetes and tooth loss An analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003-2004","Manthan H. Patel, BDS, MPH; Jayanth V. Kumar, DDS, MPH; Mark E. Moss, DDS, MS, PhD","Background. The authors conducted an analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to understand the association between diabetes and tooth loss in the United States. Methods. The authors analyzed the oral examination and self-reported diabetes data obtained from the NHANES 2003-2004 cycle and included 2,508 participants representing a civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population 50 years and older. The authors calculated the prevalence of edentulism and the number of missing teeth among dentate people, and they used multiple regression analyses to assess the association between diabetes and tooth loss. Results. The prevalence of edentulism was 28 percent and 14 percent among people with and without diabetes, respectively. The multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that people with diabetes were more likely to be edentulous than were those without diabetes (adjusted odds ratio = 2.25; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.19-4.21). Among dentate adults, those with diabetes had a higher number of missing teeth than did adults without diabetes (mean [standard error {SE}] = 9.8 [0.67]), mean [SE] = 6.7 [0.29]); P < .01). Conclusions. These study results revealed that adults with diabetes are at higher risk of experiencing tooth loss and edentulism than are adults without diabetes. One of every five cases of edentulism in the United States is linked to diabetes. Practical Implications. Although the association between diabetes and periodontal disease is well established, health care professionals also need to recognize the risk of tooth loss and its effect on quality of life among people with diabetes. Key Words. Diabetes; tooth loss; edentulism; National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).","Tooth loss and edentulism (complete absence of teeth) both are considered poor health outcomes that have a negative impact on a person’s quality of life.1 The prevalence of tooth loss increases with age and is a major problem for people 60 years and older. Adverse consequences of tooth loss include difficulty in chewing and speaking, esthetic dissatisfaction and social stigma.2-5 Moreover, investigators have reported an association between tooth loss and lower consumption of dietary fiber, fruits and vegetables, as well as with a high intake of cholesterol and saturated fatty foods.6-9 In addition, the results of epidemiologic studies suggest that edentulism and tooth loss are associated independently with chronic heart disease, hypertension, stroke, cancer and other systemic diseases.10-14 According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),2 the prevalence of edentulism was 31 percent and 25 percent among people 60 years and older during the years 1988-1994 and 1999-2002, respectively; and the average number of teeth in the oral cavity was 18.4 and 19.4 among dentate people 60 years and older during the same years in the United States, respectively.2 Although the prevalence of tooth loss has declined over the past few decades, it still is a significant public health problem that will continue to affect the baby-boomer generation in the United States. Chronic periodontal disease and severe dental caries are the primary reasons for tooth loss in adults.15 Investigators in several studies have reported that factors such as age, level of education, family income, geographical location, access to care, smoking history and health insurance coverage are associated with tooth loss.16-18 The prevalence of periodontal disease is higher among people 50 years and older and and among those in low socioeconomic groups in the United States than in other segments of the population.19,20 The findings of previously published narrative reviews suggest a strong association between diabetes and periodontal disease.21,22 It is important to consider diabetes as a major factor when trying to understand the reasons for tooth loss, because the condition affects more than 26 million (8.3 percent) people in the United States. Among people 65 years and older, 11 million (27 percent) are affected by diabetes.23 Diabetes is associated with periodontal disease and other systemic complications.21,24 A review of the literature consistently has shown a higher prevalence, incidence, severity and progression of periodontal disease in people with diabetes; yet, when one examines the same variables as they relate to dental caries, the results are inconsistent.16,21,25 One of the objectives of Healthy People 2020 is that by 2020, at least 61.2 percent of people with diabetes have at least an annual dental examination (objective D-8).26 Given all the supportive evidence of an association between diabetes and periodontal disease, it is surprising that researchers in only two population-based studies reported an association between diabetes and tooth loss.27,28 Therefore, we conducted a study to understand the association between diabetes and tooth loss in the United States. MEtHODS We assessed the publicly available NHANES data for the 2003-2004 cycle.29 Since 1999, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has collected data continuously in two-year cycles. In the 2003-2004 cycle, NHANES investigators collected detailed oral health examination data, which we used for this analysis. NHANES uses a complex, stratified, multistage probability sample to measure the health and nutritional status of adults and children who represent the civilian, noninstitutionalized population in the United States. Detailed description of selection of participants is provided elsewhere.29 To obtain precise estimates for specific groups, especially people older than 60 years, the survey cycle oversampled this age group in the 2003-2004 period. Tooth loss is more prevalent in people 50 years and older; hence, we restricted our analysis to this age group.19 We included 2,508 participants who were 50 years and older and for whom there were oral health status and self-reported diabetes data. The confidentiality of sample participants was protected by means of masked identifiers.Data collection. We used the diabetes questionnaire to assess the participants’ self-reported diabetes status. The questionnaire did not differentiate between type 1 or type 2 diabetes. NHANES field office staff members reviewed all data for accuracy and completeness. Participants were asked the following question by trained interviewers in their homes: “Have you ever been told by a doctor or health care professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?” Responses were entered as “yes,” “no” or “borderline.” Self-diagnosed diabetes, prediabetes, high sugar, and any conditions other than “diabetes” or “sugar diabetes” were not included during the interview. We categorized the participants with borderline diabetes as having diabetes, whereas we excluded from the analyses those who responded “re-fused” and “don't know.” We divided the presence of exposure as a dichotomous variable into participants reporting they had diabetes and those reporting they did not have diabetes. We considered women who had had diabetes only during the time of pregnancy to not have diabetes at the time of data collection if they were not pregnant. Tooth loss was the principal outcome of interest. We calculated the prevalence of edentulism and the number of missing teeth among dentate people 50 years and older. Oral examinations were performed by trained dental examiners in mobile examination centers (MEC). Examiners assessed tooth count separately for each tooth space and reported the participant as having a primary tooth, a permanent tooth, a dental implant, a root tip or an absent tooth. During analysis, we counted only missing permanent teeth to create a variable named “total number of teeth missing,” and we excluded dental implants. Furthermore, we categorized the participant as an edentulous person if he or she was missing all permanent teeth. The survey did not assess the reasons for tooth loss. The two outcome variables were edentulism—according to which we dichotomized participants as edentulous or not (that is, having at least one natural tooth present in the oral cavity)—and a continuous variable, total number of missing teeth in a dentate person. We considered a total of 28 teeth (12 anterior and 16 posterior) and excluded all third molars owing to their typical early removal and frequently impacted nature (as described by Eklund and Pittman 30).We selected the following potential confounding factors on the basis of the results of previous epidemiologic studies 27,28: age, sex, race/ ethnicity, education, family income, dental insurance and history of smoking. We categorized age in the univariate analysis and considered it as a continuous variable during model analysis. Race/ethnicity was recorded as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic and other. Level of education was categorized as less than high school, equal to high school graduation or General Educational Development certificate or more than high school. We categorized annual family income as less than $10,000, $10,000-$19,999, $20,000-$44,999, $45,000-$64,999 or $65,000 or more. We divided dental insurance into a dichotomous variable as having dental insurance or not having dental insurance. We used the number of days the person smoked to assign each participant to one of three smoking-status categories: never smoker, light smoker or heavy smoker.Statistical analyses. We used statistical analysis software (SAS Version 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) for calculating various statistics and for estimating standard errors (SEs) by using the survey module. The complex design of the sample selection included county, city-block, household and household-person levels of stratification. We used the MEC examination statistical weight with cluster and strata variables provided by NHANES to calculate weighted point estimates and standard errors. Weighted numbers account for the complex survey design (including oversampling), survey nonresponse and poststratification (that is, the number of people in the population represented by that sample person).We conducted descriptive and weighted analyses to describe the prevalence of edentulism and the number of missing teeth among people with and without diabetes. We assessed the statistical significance for the differences in the prevalence of edentulism over the different exposure categories by using c2 tests. We used the t test to measure the mean differences in the number of missing teeth between dentate people with and without diabetes. We performed a multiple logistic regression analysis to determine the effect of diabetes on edentulism. We calculated the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and regression coefficients along with 95 percent confidence interval (CI) to report statistical significance at .05 level. We used multiple linear regression to control for the effect of potential confounding factors on the total number of missing teeth. We used the MEC examination weight provided by NHANES 29 to obtain results that are representative of the U.S. population 50 years and older. We excluded from the multivariate analyses participants with missing values. In addition, we estimated the population attributable risk (PAR) percentage in a cross-sectional study by using the Levin31 formula under the assumption that the diagnosis of diabetes preceded the outcome of edentulism.NHANES investigators surveyed 10,122 people during the 2003-2004 cycle. Of these participants, only 2,508 were 50 years and older, which represented 77 million noninstitutionalized civilian people in the United States. In this sample of 2,508 people, only 453 participants were edentulous. We included the remaining 2,055 in the analysis for exploring the association between diabetes and missing teeth.RESultS The estimated prevalence of edentulism was 17 percent (95 percent CI, 12.7-20.6) among the U.S. population 50 years and older in 2003-2004 (Table 1). On the basis of self-reports of diabetes status, 18 percent (95 percent CI, 14.1-21.0) had diabetes. The prevalence of edentulism was 28 percent and 14 percent among people with and without diabetes, respectively, and was significantly higher among people with diabetes (P<.001). This prevalence also increased with age. Hispanics had the lowest prevalence of edentulism when compared with non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, but the differences were not statistically significant. In addition, people with less than a high school education and an annual family income of less than $10,000 had a higher prevalence of edentulism compared with those who had more than a high school education and those whose income was $65,000 or higher. People with dental insurance coverage had lower rates of edentulism compared with those without insurance. Heavy smokers had the highest rates of edentulism; how-ever, the differences among the smoking subcategories were not statistically significant.The mean number of missing teeth per person was 7.2 (95 percent CI, 6.4-7.9) among the overall sample of dentate people 50 years and older (Table 2). In this age group, those people with diabetes had more tooth loss than did those without diabetes (P< .001). Again, older, less educated and lower-income groups had greater tooth loss. Non-Hispanic whites were missing fewer teeth than were non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, but the difference was not significant. People without dental insurance coverage and people who smoked tended to have more tooth loss.Table 3 (page 483) shows the results of multiple logistic regression analysis after the potential confounding factors were controlled for. Diabetes remained a strong independent risk factor for tooth loss (adjusted OR, 2.25; 95 percent CI, 1.19-4.21). The other factors that were associated with edentulism after we controlled for potential confounding factors were age, race/ethnicity (Hispanics as compared with non- Hispanic whites), education, income and smoking status. Table 4 (page 484) presents the results of the multiple linear regression analysis for number of missing teeth among dentate adults 50 years and older. It showed similar results—people with diabetes having more tooth loss than people without diabetes—after adjustment for other variables. We used the above-mentioned adjusted OR of 2.25 associated with diabetes to derive the PAR percentage for edentulism. We estimated that 18 percent (almost one of five) of the cases of edentulism in the United States were linked to diabetes among people 50 years and older.DISCuSSIOn The study results show that diabetes is associated independently with both edentulism and tooth loss in the U.S. population. The findings are consistent with the results of two other large studies conducted in the United States 27 And Mexico,28 in which investigators also reported greater tooth loss among people with diabetes. The researchers in the U.S. study used self-reported data regarding tooth loss and diabetes from the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to explore the association between diabetes and tooth loss among people 18 years and older.27 In contrast, the data in our study were collected by trained dental examiners, a process that provides more valid and accurate estimates that, in turn, strengthen the association between diabetes and tooth loss. The investigators in the Mexican study also found higher rates of edentulism among people with diabetes 35 years and older (OR = 1.82; 95 percent CI, 1.39-2.38) nationally.28 In a literature review conducted by Taylor and colleagues 16 in 2004, most studies reported more tooth loss among people with diabetes, but neither of the population-based reports from the United States were designed with tooth loss as the primary focus. Therefore, our study provides the first valid population-based estimates that can be generalized to the U.S. population 50 years and older.The higher prevalence of edentulism and tooth loss observed among people with diabetes has important implications for promoting oral health. In the United States, edentulism and tooth loss not only affect quality of life but also are associated with lower consumption of essential nutrients and unhealthy dietary patterns.8,32 Several specific mechanisms have been proposed suggesting that diabetes can increase the risk of experiencing periodontal disease and subsequent tooth loss.22 In 2009, the International Diabetes Federation 33 (IDF) released guidelines on oral health for people with diabetes that included important recommendations such as annual oral health checkups for people with diabetes, day-to-day dental care as a part of diabetes self-management and education about poor oral health outcomes. The results of our analysis support the need to monitor annual dental visits among people with diabetes, as well as to identify people with diabetes and refer them for dental care appropriately so as to avert periodontal disease and, ultimately, tooth loss. Strengths and limitations of the study. A major strength of this study is that it is based on a representative sample of the general, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Because of oversampling of people 60 years and older in the NHANES cycle for 2003-2004, the estimates for this age group are more precise and reliable than those in previous surveys. One of the limitations of the study is that its cross-sectional design did not account for temporality—that is, whether diabetes preceded tooth loss in the participants. However, investigators in other studies have established that diabetes is a risk factor for periodontal disease.21,22 Another limitation of our study is the use of self-reports of diabetes status. If diabetes status was misclassified, then it is likely that the true association between diabetes and tooth loss is diluted. The CDC estimates that as many as 7 million Americans have diabetes but are undiagnosed.23 Furthermore, we were not able to assess the potential effect of preventive attitudes toward dental care, such as undertaking regular dental visits, on the association between diabetes and tooth loss. Owing to confidentiality requirements, we could not measure the effect geographical location had on the association either. Additional analysis of reasons for tooth loss also was not possible owing to a lack of data that could have explained the role of periodontal disease in tooth loss.Suggestions for the future. Edentulism and tooth loss are preventable disabilities that generally are not considered a public health issue among people with diabetes in the United States. Although deriving estimates of PAR percentages on the basis of cross-sectional survey data requires the assumption that diabetes preceded edentulism, the PAR percentage estimates help public health practitioners to com-municate the potential impact of appropriate oral health care among people with diabetes. Since there are established programs to address disabilities among people with diabetes, opportunities exist for integrating oral health care into those programs. Diabetes-related eye care is one of the preventive programs sponsored by the CDC’s state-based diabetes prevention and control programs (DCPs) to prevent blindness among people with diabetes.34 Hence, oral care for people with diabetes that is sponsored by the DPCP could be considered to avert tooth loss and edentulism. We also suggest that recommendations from the IDF guidelines be used to adopt new practice protocols and to revise existing public policies to prevent edentulism and tooth loss among people with diabetes.COnCluSIOn Diabetes was associated independently with edentulism and greater tooth loss in a large, nationally representative sample of adults 50 years and older. Tooth loss also was significantly associated with age, level of education, annual family income and smoking status. Calculation of PAR percentage provides us with an estimate of the effect of diabetes on the U.S. population in terms of tooth loss. We found that 18 percent of the cases of complete tooth loss in the United States are attributable to diabetes. This serves as a call to action for all health professionals to address diabetes as an oral health concern for the U.S. population.",-,"1.

"An Assessment of the Association Between Functional Edentulism,Obesity, and NIDDM","THOMAS J. CLEARY, DDS JOHN E. HUTTON, DDS, MS, MPH","OBJECTIVE — To assess the association between a measure of extensive tooth loss(functional edentulism) and obesity with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus(NIDDM) in a racially heterogeneous sample.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS— A cross sectional survey (370 subjects) was performed by reviewing the medical and dental records of independently or independently living individuals who were treated as inpatients and/or outpatients at a Department of Veterans Affairs facility. Frequencies and descriptive measures were derived; univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to test for associations, confounding, effect modification, and interaction using functional edentulism and obesity as the independent variables and NIDDM as the dependent measure.RESULTS — Functionally edentulous individuals were at significantly greater risk for NIDDM (estimated odds ratio [OR] = 4.06), than the obese (OR = 3.29). These Relationships were not confounded by age or race in this sample. Obesity did confound functional edentulism in the multivariable model, suggesting that they act independently on the outcome variable (NIDDM).CONCLUSIONS— Dentist-assessed functional edentulism and physician-diagnosed obesity were significantly associated with NIDDM in this sample of predominantly older men. This finding ought to be considered by primary care providers in formulating dietary strategies in order to facilitate the realization of their therapeutic goals.","Recent studies suggest an increase in tooth loss in diabetic individuals(1) and in the prevalence of complete edentulousness among non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)patients who are members of special populations (2). Secondary data analysis has identified a significantly increased risk of NIDDM among unrestored edentulous Hispanic individuals (3). Of related concern, diminished mental capacity has been associated with reduced functional efficiency and concomitant dietary selectivity (4-6). Trends have shown that completely edentulous persons tend to avoid protein, fiber, fresh fruits, and vegetables in favor of softer foods rich in carbohydrates and saturated fats (7); this invites the risk of obesity. The association between obesity and NIDDM is well established (8); that between extensive tooth loss and NIDDM is not. Our specific interest is to assess the association between extensive tooth loss and obesity and NIDDM in a sample of people who do not bear the characteristics of special populations with well established risks (i.e.,Pima Indians or Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [HHANES]).This study was based upon the assumption that an association exists between extensive tooth loss and NIDDM and upon the assumption that obesity might influence this outcome. We hypothesize that a significant association exists between NIDDM, obesity, and a measure of extensive tooth loss (functional edentulism).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — To test this hypothesis,a cross-sectional survey of a randomly selected sample (n = 370) of patient records was conducted at a Department Of Veterans Affairs facility. The surveyed records were of patients living independently or independently in the hospital or community. Data were abstracted concerning age, race, sex, physician-diagnosed NIDDM and obesity, and dentist-assessed dental status. Criteria for the diagnosis of NIDDM were those of the National Diabetes Data Group (9); obesity was defined as a body mass in excess of 25% over the ideal body mass. For purposes of the study, dental status was categorized into one of three groups: dentate (26 or more teeth), partially edentulous(7-25 teeth), or functionally edentulous(6 or fewer teeth). After removing all records with missing data values, 292 cases were analyzed (SAS) (10,11). Distributions of variables were followed by univariate analyses. A logistic regression model was used to correct for confounding and to detect significance of main and interactive effects. Alternative models were constructed to rule out multicollinearity, and regression diagnostics were performed to assess and improve fit.RESULTS— The sample was 96.2%men and 3.8% women and had a mean age of 47.5 years with a standard deviation of 13.1 years and an age range of 27-86 years. Distribution by race was 47.6% Caucasian, 40.1% black, and 12.3% Hispanic. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed NIDDM was low(6.2%), and a physician diagnosed 13.4%of the sample as obese. Dental status was distributed as follows: dentate, 24.0%;partially edentulous, 65.4%; and functionally edentulous, 10.6%.The age effect was significant in the univariate model (Table 1), suggest-ing the expected relationship between increasing age and NIDDM (P = 0.0035).However, after considering confounding and interaction with the multivariable model, age was no longer associated with NIDDM in this sample. This may be attributable to ~70% of the sample's ages falling between 34 and 61 years. Likewise, no significance was detected for either the sample's race or its sex effects.The dental effect defined the den-tate and partially edentulous groups with similar NIDDM rates (4.29% and 4.19%);however, the functionally edentulous group had a dramatic increase in NIDDM with a rate of 22.5% (Fig. 1). Comparing The functionally edentulous group with the others resulted in an odds ratio (OR)estimate of 6.63, 95% confidence interval(CI) 2.35-18.68, which decreased slightly^after adjusting for small sample bias (ORSS = 5.83, 95% CI 2^5-18.10).The OR decreased further (OR = 3.29,95%CI 1.15-9.41) when confounding was considered (Table 2). Such a dramatic change in likelihood between the univariate and multivariable models was seen only for the variables of functional edentulism and obesity.Physician-diagnosed obesity was significantly associated with NIDDM, NIDDM, 439%NORMAL, 95.71%DENTATENIDDM, 2238%expected. The univariate model (Table 1)revealed that subjects who had been as obese were 3.5 times more likely to be positive for NIDDM than non obese subjects. Adjustment for confounding(Table 2) decreased this estimate only/\ slightly (OR = 3.29); this was consistent with a population effect as low as 1.15 andas high as 9.41.The multiple logistic regression model adjusted for confounding and revealed that obesity and functional edentulism were significantly associated with NIDDM (P = 0.03 and 0.02, ). The association of NIDDM with these two variables (OR = 3.29 and 4.06) was large. The confidence intervals were wide, indicating that sample size was small and/or variability high. Confounding did occur in the multivariable model between functional edentulism and obesity, suggesting that they act independently on the outcome variable (NIDDM).None of the possible two-way interactions are significant (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS— We conclude that, for a sample of predominantly older men, functional edentulism and obesity are significantly associated with NIDDM(P = 0.0205, P = 0.0349). Obesity appears to confound the relationship between functional edentulism and NIDDM,and this should be explored.It is beyond the scope of this study to assess the effect of dental restorative status or the duration of NIDDM on the association described here. This is recommended as a focus for future efforts.Little concern has been focused upon the functional dental capacity of diabetic individuals. Significant functional impairment is the direct result of extensive tooth loss. Functional edentulism is a fundamental representation of this gross depletion of oral functional capacity. This Has important therapeutic implications. Itis presumptuous to expect good dietary compliance from patients with compromised masticatory function. Therefore,medical care providers and nutritional therapists need to be aware of this limitation and alter therapeutic strategies in away that is designed to address this risk and to resolve or accommodate it in order to enhance dietary control and realize treatment goals.Acknowledgments—We wish to express gratitude for the support of Miklos Losonczy,MD, PhD, Chief-of-Staff, and Paul N.

Edentulism Among Mexican Adults Aged 35 Years and Older and Associated Factors,"Carlo E. Medina-Solís, DDS, MSc, RicardoPérez-Núñez, MD, MSc, Gerardo Maupomé,PhD, MSc, BDS, DDPH RCS(E), and Juan F.Casanova-Rosado, DDS, MSc","We used National Performance Evaluation Survey data to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of edentulism among noninstitutionalized adults aged 35 years and older in Mexico. Statistically,the variables positively associated with edentulism were older age(odds ratio [OR] = 1.08) and female gender (OR = 1.79). Non Smoking status (OR = 0.70) and having a higher wealth index score (OR = 0.72) were negatively associated. This information constitutes the first large-scale evaluation in Mexico for one of the World Health Organization’priority oral health problems.","The World Health Organization (WHO)considers edentulism (complete absence of natural teeth) a poor public health outcomes that substantially affects oral and general health status, as well as quality of life. It is an important but often-overlooked public health issue, especially for the elderly.1,2 Oral health status plays an important role in the nutrition of adults and older people.3 Tooth loss has been associated with changes in food taste and food preferences and nutritional deficiency.3,4 Little oral health epidemiological information is available for the Mexican populations: specifically, no information is available on prevalence of edentulism in adults and the elderly. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of edentulism among a large-scale sample of noninstitutionalized people aged 35 years and older in Mexico. METHODS The National Performance Evaluation Survey 2002–2003 (a countrywide evaluation of health services in Mexico) was part of the technical collaboration between the Ministry Of Health of Mexico and WHO, which used the survey instrument and sampling strategies developed by WHO for the World Health Survey. The National Institute of Public Health And the Ministry of Health of Mexico General Directorate of Performance Evaluation under-took the survey. The National Performance Evaluation Survey provides policymakers with reliable and internationally comparable baseline information on a variety of health indicators, including general population health measures and the effectiveness of health systems.The National Performance Evaluation Survey was conducted between November 2002 and April 2003 and collected information from 38 746 households in 32 states in Mexico, with a mean of 1250 households per state, although only 20 Mexican states collected dental data. The sampling frame is probabilistic, stratified, used a multistage cluster design and was calculated to provide representative information at both the state cleveland by urban and rural areas.5The survey comprised a face-to-face interview divided into household and individual questionnaires. (Both questionnaires and discussion of general methodological issues are available on WHO’s Web page: http://www3.who.int/whs/P/instrumentandrel8293.html.)The household survey includes general topics,such as physical characteristics of the household and ownership of consumer goods, which were combined in the polychoric principal components analysis to construct a wealth index.6The dependent variable in our analyses was self-reported edentulism (individuals who stated that they had lost all of their natural teeth). Weighted analyses were conducted in Stata software 8.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex) with the module svy. Bivariate And multivariate logistic regression analyses were undertaken. To avoid multicollinearity in the variables included in the final model,the variance inflation factor test was performed. Finally, the Box–Tidwell test was performed to evaluate whether continuous variables in the final model were related to the logit of the dependent variable lineally.The multivariate logistic regression model incorporated all variables available (socio-demographic and socioeconomic) that were thought to be related to edentulism and associated at the bivariate analysis level with P<.25 to control for possible confusion.RESULTS National Performance Evaluation Survey Data on dental conditions were available only for subjects aged 18 years and older, representing a total of 24 159 households. In The current round of analyses, only survey respondents who were aged older than 35 years (n = 13 966) were included, representing 29 853 607 adult country inhabitants. All results presented are weighted.The mean age was 50.95 ± 12.98 SD (ranging from 35 to 98 years old), with 57.9%women (n = 17 296 022) and 42.1% men(n = 12 557 585). Overall prevalence of edentulism in this adult population was 10.2%;when the WHO’s “age index” for prevalence of edentulism was used, the proportion for the elderly ( > 65 years old) was 30.6% and for the younger adults (35–44 years old) was2.4%. Figure 1 shows the geographic distribution of edentulism in Mexico, with prevalence ranging from 5.0% in Tlaxcala (central Mexico) to 16.7% in Michoacán (western Mexico). Table 1 presents descriptive results for the study population.In the bivariate analyses (Table 1), we observed that age, gender, smoking, diabetes,health insurance status, marital status, occupation, and wealth index were positively associated with edentulism, whereas preventive attitude and higher level of schooling were negatively associated with edentulism. The Multivariate logistic regression model (Table 2)adjusted for schooling and Indian ethnic status showed that for each year of age increase,the odds of being edentulous increased 8%(95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07, 1.09), with women being 1.79 times more likely(95% CI = 1.50, 2.13) to be edentulous, but nonsmokers (odds ratio [OR] = 0.70; 95%CI=0.54, 0.90) and better-off people (higher wealth index) (OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.53,0.98) being less likely to lose all of their natural teeth. No plausible interaction terms were significant. There was no effect when differentiating urban and rural areas.DISCUSSION The importance of preserving teeth in good condition not only may be restricted to quality of life in the elderly 1,2 but also may be an indicator of general health because edentulism is associated with systemic, chronic diseases.7–9 Our study provides large-scale data for the first time in Mexico on one of the priority oral health indicators proposed by WHO. Most of the studies performed in other countries have included only people aged 60 years and older.The prevalence observed in our study for the elderly (30.6%) can be contrasted with reports from other countries; both similarities and disparities occur. Our findings fall within the range derived from a telephone survey in the United States10: in 1997, the prevalence ranged from 13.9% (in Hawaii) to 47.9% (in West Virginia), and in 2002, it ranged from 13% (in Hawaii and California) to 42% (in Kentucky).11The Mexican prevalence is also similar to that observed in Australians (also obtained through self-report in a telephone survey)1but much higher than the 7.0% re-ported in Japanese adults.12As in the other studies, our results were based on self-reports that, although not verified by dental personnel, have been shown to have high correlation with clinical examinations in these age groups.13It can be safely assumed that the lay public knows when no teeth are present.As previously reported, age is strongly associated with edentulism 1,14; this finding is not surprising, because the cumulative effects of dental caries and periodontal diseases,15,16 as well as treatment decisions associated with these 2 main reasons for tooth loss, increase with age. Differential treatment choices across the socio economic continuum, such as endodontic treatment versus tooth extraction,also may play a role in the overall tooth loss phenomenon. As reported by other authors,women are more likely to be edentulous thanare men.1 Because cigarette smoking is a risk factor for adult periodontitis and tooth loss,10the higher prevalence of edentulism among smokers may be directly related to the adverse effects of smoking on periodontal health. This association also has been observed in other studies.10,17The periodontal status of former smokers ranks between that of never smokers and current smokers, suggesting that smoking causes changes in the periodontium but that the deterioration may not continue after tobacco use cessation.18As in other countries, we found that edentulism is closely associated with socioeconomic variables. Epidemiological studies show that persons of low social class or low income and individuals with few years of schooling are more likely to be edentulous than are persons of higher social class, in-come, and educational attainment.14 Our study had certain limitations that emphasize a cautious interpretation of results. Cross-sectional study measures associations at1 point in time, introducing the problem of temporal ambiguity and the inability to establish causal relationships. Furthermore, this study cannot be considered truly nationally representative because 12 of 32 states(mostly northern states) were excluded because of survey logistics. Contrast of results with other countries is limited by necessity because studies in comparable settings in emerging economies are not available.This baseline information constitutes the first national evaluation in Mexico for one of the priority WHO oral health problems. The Observed prevalence of edentulism was moderate to low in the adult and elderly groups(compared with other reports in non-Mexican Populations). This important oral health condition was strongly linked to birth cohorts and possibly associated with increasing age. This Study of noninstitutionalized adults found a significant relation between sociodemographic variables (e.g., age and gender) and edentulism, with socioeconomic status (as measured by the wealth index) playing a role in the prevalence of edentulism. Non Smoking status had an effect on edentulism, separate from socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors.Future studies should examine risk factors for tooth loss to effect changes in health systems and increase tooth longevity.",-,"1.Adams C, Slack-Smith LM, Larson A, O'Grady MJ.Edentulism and associated factors in people 60 years and over from rural and remote Western Australia.Aust Dent J. 2003;48:10–14.2.Steele JG, Sanders AE, Slade GD, et al.

"Periodontal Disease, Tooth Loss and Incident Rheumatoid Arthritis: Results from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and its Epidemiologic Follow-up Study","Ryan T. Demmer, PhD, MPH, Jerry A. Molitor, MD, PhD, David R. Jacobs Jr., PhD, and Bryan S. Michalowicz, DDS","Aims—Infection may be a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk factor. We examined whether signs of periodontal infection were associated with RA development in NHANES I & NHEFS.Materials and Methods—In 1971–1974, 9,702 men and women aged 25–74 were enrolled and surveyed longitudinally (1982,1986,1987,1992). Periodontal infection was defined by baseline tooth loss or clinical evidence of periodontal disease. Baseline(n=138) and incident(n=433) RAcases were defined via self-report physician diagnosis, joint pain/swelling, ICD-9 codes (714.0–714.9), death certificates, and/or RA hospitalization.Results—Adjusted odds ratios (ORs)[95%CI] for prevalent RA in gingivitis and periodontitis(vs. healthy) were 1.09[0.57,2.10] and 1.85[0.95,3.63]; incident RA ORs were 1.32[0.85,2.06] and1.00[0.68,1.48]. The ORs for prevalent RA among participants missing 5–8, 9–14, 15–31 or 32 teeth (vs. 0–4 teeth) were 1.74[1.03,2.95], 1.82[0.81,4.10], 1.45[0.62,3.41] and 1.30[0.48,3.53];ORs for incident RA were 1.12[0.77,1.64], 1.67[1.12,2.48], 1.40[0.85,2.33] and 1.22[0.75,2.00].Dose-responsiveness was enhanced among never-smokers. The rate of death or loss-to-follow-up after 1982 was 2–4 fold higher among participants with periodontitis or missing ≥9 teeth (vs.healthy participants).Conclusions—Although participants with periodontal disease or≥5 missing teeth experienced higher odds of prevalent/incident RA, most ORs were no statistically significant and lacked dose-responsiveness. Differential RA ascertainment bias complicated the interpretation of these data.Keywords Rheumatoid Arthritis; Periodontal; Infections; Cohort Studies; Bias","Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic, disabling disease affecting 0.5–1% of the population(Tobon et al., 2010). Early and aggressive interventions have reduced the rate of progression of the disease and its long-term disability(Klareskog et al., 2009). Nevertheless,the majority of patients continue to require lifelong, often expensive or inaccessible therapy,and have increased mortality, particularly due to cardiovascular disease even with more aggressive and modern treatments(Gabriel, 2008). Thus, there is a strong need to understand the risk factors and preclinical disease pathways leading to clinical RA, to facilitate preclinical RA intervention.The most important known risk factors for RA are genetic. The “shared epitope” (SE) – a short peptide sequence found in multiple HLA-DR alleles – is the most significant genetic risk factor, and cigarette smoking interacts with SE alleles to increase the risk of autoantibodies against citrullinated peptides that predict risk for RA(Klareskog et al., 2009).Microbial exposures have been suggested as a risk factor for RA(Rosenstein et al., 2004).Periodontal disease, which is partly caused by gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species(Haffajee and Socransky, 1994, Papapanou et al., 1997, Timmerman et al., 2001, van Winkelhoff et al., 2002, Van der Velden et al., 2006, Paster et al., 2006, Demmer et al.,2008c), shares several pathobiological features with RA(Rosenstein et al., 2004, Culshaw etal., 2011). Two recent small clinical trials have demonstrated that periodontal therapy among RA patients can reduce RA disease activity(Al-Karma et al., 2007, Ortiz et al., 2009)providing evidence that periodontal infections might exacerbate RA severity. Others have reported associations between periodontitis and RA in cross-sectional studies(de Pablo et al.,2008, Pischon et al., 2008, de Pablo et al., 2009). Such associations, however, may arise from shared environmental or genetic risk factors that result in similar pathobiology.Importantly, associations between periodontitis and RA have been observed following adjustment for smoking, which is the most important known shared environmental risk factor(de Pablo et al., 2008, de Pablo et al., 2009, Molitor, 2009). Thus, periodontal disease pathobiology might contribute to the development of RA or vice versa.Longitudinal analyses can help to establish the temporal relationship between clinical periodontal disease and RA. The only available longitudinal data that followed the development of RA subsequent to the assessment of periodontal infection suggest increased incidence of RA in never smokers with moderate to severe periodontitis in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort(Molitor, 2009).The First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) and its epidemiological follow – up study (NHEFS) provide a unique opportunity to examine the association between prevalent periodontal disease and both prevalent and incident because: i) both medical and dental evaluations were conducted concurrently at baseline;and ii) the large nationally representative sample and long longitudinal follow-up period enabled the accumulation of adequate RA event rates. We tested the hypothesis that baseline evidence of historical exposure to periodontal infections (assessed via clinical periodontal examination and tooth loss status) can predict both prevalent and incident RAY in the nationally representative, population-based setting of NHANES I and NHEFS. Based on findings from the ARIC study(Molitor, 2009), we also hypothesized that the association with incident RAY would be strongest in never smokers. We have included the cross-sectional aims in our current report to establish consistency with previous research. METHODS Details concerning the design of NHANES I and its Epidemiologic Follow-up Study have been previously published.(DeStefano et al., 1993) Briefly, NHANES I was a national probability sample of the non-institutionalized U.S. population aged 1–74 years, conducted during 1971–1974. NHEFS is a longitudinal study including all persons initially 25–74 years of age who completed a medical examination at NHANES I (14,407). The NHEFS is comprised of four follow-up studies occurring during the four periods of 1982 – 1984, 1986,1987 and 1992. The 1986, 1987 and 1992 follow-up assessments utilized the same design and data collection procedures developed in the 1982–1984 NHEFS, except that a 30-minute computer-assisted telephone interview was administered rather than a personal interview.No physical measurements were taken during the 1986 – 1992 exams. The 1986 NHEFS was conducted for members of the NHEFS cohort who were 55–74 years of age at their baseline examination and not known to be deceased at the 1982–84 NHEFS (3,980). The 1987 (11,750) and 1992 (11,195) follow-up evaluations were conducted for the entire surviving cohort. Ninety-six percent of the study population was successfully traced at some point through the 1992 follow-up. Tracing rates for each completed wave ranged from 90%to 94% and interview rates ranged from 91% to 96% of those traced.Periodontal Disease Assessment Dental examiners were trained to follow a written set of objective standards to narrow the range of examiner variability by eliminating conditions known to be sources of disagreement.(Kelly and Harvey, 1979, Miller and National Center for Health Statistics(U.S.), 1973)The Periodontal Index (PI)(Russell, 1956) was used to assess the presence or absence of periodontal disease for each tooth (maximum=32) by assigning scores (PI range=0–8) based on gingival inflammation extent, the presence/absence of periodontal pockets – i.e.attachment loss according to Russell(Russell, 1956) – and tooth mobility. As previously described(Wu et al., 2000), these tooth level assessments, in combination with tooth counts,were used to assign a periodontal classification to all participants as follows: i) healthy periodontium: no teeth with periodontal disease or not more than 1 tooth with mild gingivitis if 20 or more teeth were examined; ii) gingivitis: at least 1 tooth with mild gingivitis or worse condition that did not fit the category for either no periodontal disease or periodontitis; iii) periodontitis: 4 or more teeth with “overt pockets” (i.e. attachment loss) or worse conditions.Rheumatoid Arthritis Definition Baseline (prevalent) rheumatoid arthritis was defined by either participant self-report of physician diagnosis or physical examination data corresponding to criteria 1–4 of the American Rheumatism Association 1987 criteria(Arnett et al., 1988).Incident rheumatoid arthritis was defined as follows: i) death certificate: International Classification of Death, Ninth Revision (ICD)-9 code in the range of 714.0–714.9 (two cases included based solely on ICD-9 codes of 714.8–714.9), or rheumatism otherwise listed on the death certificate; ii) self-reported physician diagnosis (based on 1986–1992 interviews);or iii) health care facility stay with a discharge diagnosis of rheumatism (ICD-9 codes).Risk Factor Assessment As previously described(Demmer et al., 2008a), confounding variables related to RA risk,periodontal infection and/or indicative of healthy lifestyle were collected during the baseline evaluation including age, gender, race (African American, Caucasian, Other), poverty index(total household income in the numerator and total income necessary to maintain the family on a nutritionally adequate food plan in the denominator; values>1 indicate incomes above poverty), education level (completed ≤8th grade, 9th–12th grade, some college, college graduate), body mass index (BMI, weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared),physical activity. Detailed cigarette smoking history information was collected on a subset of participants at baseline and for the remaining participants during the 1982–1984 follow-up. This approach has been validated(Machlin et al., 1989, McLaughlin et al., 1987).Statistical analysis SAS software version 9.2 was used to conduct multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the association between baseline periodontal disease or tooth loss level and the cumulative incidence of rheumatoid arthritis. Participants were classified as being either periodontally healthy or having gingivitis or periodontitis, as described above. Tooth loss was also considered as a surrogate marker of historical periodontal infection. Participants Were categorized as having 0–4 missing teeth (MT), 5–8 MT, 9–14 MT, 15–31 MT; or 32MT. The SURVEYLOGISTIC(SAS) procedure in SAS was used to account for the complex survey design (based on survey locations 1–65). Proportional hazards survival analysis was performed (using PHREG) although these findings should be interpreted cautiously asPHREG is unable to account for the NHANES stratification, clustering and sample weights;this limitation underestimates variance but does not bias the reported hazard ratios. Our Multivariable models were based on the following currently established risk factors for RA:smoking behaviors, age and gender; no HLA genotypes or RA family history data were available. Additional variables such as education, race, physical activity level and poverty index were included as surrogates of socio-economic status and/or healthy lifestyle. To Summarize participant characteristics (i.e., Table 1) we presented unweighted estimates to give a better sense of the characteristics of the actual data and participants analyzed.A secondary analysis considered only RA outcomes identified via health care facility discharge records to reduce the potential for bias related to inaccurate self-report of RA.Interaction models explored the aforementioned associations among smoking subgroups based on a priori evidence of stronger associations among never smokers(Molitor, 2009).Incident RA cases were predominantly determined via participant self-report during the interview. The first interview to specifically ask about RA was not conducted until 1986–1987. Because being lost-to-follow-up (LTF) or dying after 1982 would have been related to incident RAY underreporting, and was strongly associated with elevated baseline periodontal status and age, a bias might have been induced. Specifically, NHEFS participants with elevated levels of periodontal disease were less likely to have reported incident RA to the study and were therefore differentially misclassified as RA-free. We opted to keep participants who died or were LTF after 1982 in the analysis because of the potential to obtain information about incident RA occurring before 1986 from health facility records and death certificates.RESULTS Dental examinations were performed on 11,375 participants during NHANES I. We Excluded 1,052 who were never traced, an additional 604 with missing data and an additional 17 due to uncertainty regarding the date of incident RA relative to the baseline examination leaving 9,702 for cross-sectional analysis. One hundred thirty-eight participants had RA at baseline, leaving 9,564 participants for longitudinal analysis. Demographic Characteristics for the NHANES I participants have been described previously(Demmer etal., 2008a) and are presented in table 1. Having gingivitis, periodontitis or relatively advanced tooth loss was associated with higher age, male gender, smoking, lower SES and other suboptimal health measures.The rates of death or LTF after the 1982 examination among participants with a healthy periodontium, gingivitis or periodontitis, respectively, were 8%, 13% and 24%; rates across the five tooth loss categories were 8%, 10%, 17%, 21%, and 31%. The mean age of participants with death or LTF after 1982 was approximately 10 years higher than participants who completed a follow up interview after 1982.Cross-sectional Association between Periodontal Status and Rheumatoid Arthritis The prevalence of RA in the NHANES I survey was 1.4% (138 cases). After multivariable adjustment, relative to healthy participants, those with periodontitis had an approximate two-fold increase in the odds of prevalent RA. Relative to those with 0–4 missing teeth,participants with 5–8 missing teeth experienced an increase in the odds of prevalent RA(table 2); ORs among participants missing >8 teeth were not statistically significantly different than 1.0 (table 2).Longitudinal Association between Periodontal Status and Rheumatoid Arthritis The cumulative incidence of RA during 20 years of follow-up was 4.7% (433 cases) and the majority of cases were determined via self-report physician diagnosis alone (79%). An Additional 11% were determined via facility discharge alone. The remaining 10% were based on a combination of self-report, facility discharge and death certificate; no cases were determined via death certificate alone. Females had higher odds of incident RA:OR=1.47(95%CI:1.10,1.96). Five-year higher baseline age also had increased odds of incident RAY: OR=1.10(1.09,1.11). The odds ratios for former or current smoking vs. never smoking were positively, yet not statistically significantly associated with incident RAY and were as follows: 1.44(0.92,2.26) and 1.21(0.79,1.85), respectively.Participants with gingivitis at baseline experienced a non statistically significant increase odds of RA development relative to healthy participants (Table 3). There were no evident associations between either periodontitis or edentulism and incident RA (Table 3). When Considering only 88 incident RA cases diagnosed via hospital discharge, the respective OR for gingivitis, periodontitis and edentulism were 1.39(0.58,2.21), 1.28(0.54,3.06) and1.24(0.47,3.21).Consistent with the cross-sectional results, individuals with intermediate tooth loss (9–14 missing teeth) experienced an increase in the odds of incident RA (p<0.05) relative to participants missing 0–4 teeth (Table 3). The odds ratios observed among participants either missing 15–31 teeth or being edentulous were attenuated as compared to results for participants missing 9–14 teeth (Table 3). In survival analysis, the adjusted risk ratios for incident RATE among participants missing 5–8, 9–14, 15–31 or 32 teeth vs. 0–4 missing teeth were 1.10(0.75,1.60), 1.46(1.00,2.13), 1.09(0.73,1.62) and 1.16(0.78,1.72), respectively.When considering only 88 RA cases determined via hospital discharge, odds ratios for incident RATE among participants missing 5–8, 9–14, 15–31 or 32 teeth vs. 0–4 missing teeth were 1.08(0.40, 2.923), 1.45(0.52,4.04), 1.52(0.53,4.37), 1.36(0.52,3.56), respectively. The Association between tooth loss and incident RATE tended to be more pronounced among participants with either gingivitis or periodontitis (p for interaction =0.05; Figure 1).Associations between periodontal disease, tooth loss and incident RA were more dose-responsive among never smokers (Table 4). While neither gingivitis nor periodontitis was statistically significantly associated with incident RA the p-value for linear trend across levels of periodontal disease was 0.06. Among never smokers, increased tooth loss was associated with a monotonic increase in the odds for incident RA (p-value for linear trend across tooth loss categories = 0.04). Edentulous participants (relative to those missing 0–4 teeth) experienced a statistically significantly increased OR of incident RA: 1.92(1.00,3.66). DISCUSSION Participants with periodontal disease or ≥5 missing teeth experienced higher odds of prevalent and incident RAY. Most – but not all – of the reported ORs were not statistically significant and the observed patterns of RA prevalence and incidence across increasing levels of periodontal disease or tooth loss did not show dose-responsiveness which favors anull conclusion. However, while few odds ratios were statistically significant, they were consistently >1.0 for both gingivitis and tooth loss exposures, but not periodontitis,predicting incident RA (Table 3). The OR for periodontitis predicting incident RA was noticeably, but not significantly, >1.0 among never smokers (Table 4). Under the null hypothesis of no association, one would have expected the estimated ORs to be more equally distributed above and below 1.0. Despite the large dataset and long follow-up period, several characteristics of these data, as discussed below, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions in favor of or against the null hypothesis based on these results alone.To our knowledge, only two other studies have reported on the association between periodontal infection and risk for incident RA. Data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study demonstrated an increased risk of incident RATE among participants with moderate/severe periodontitis which was driven by positive associations among never smokers(Molitor, 2009). An important limitation of the ARIC data is that only 33 incident RA cases had accumulated. Our current results among never smokers support these preliminary ARIC results, although the exact nature of this interaction requires further examination. Regardless, this finding reduces the potential for any associations to have been explained by residual smoking-related confounding.In contrast, a recent publication from the Nurses Health Study (NHS) found no association between periodontal disease and incident RAY(Arkema et al., 2010). However, the primary definition of exposure to periodontal infection was defined via self-report of periodontal surgery or tooth loss in the preceding two years which likely misclassified many individuals with periodontal disease as periodontally healthy. In our current report from NHANES,participants received baseline clinical periodontal evaluations and over 400 incident cases were reported in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. We believe the higher number of cases relative to other studies likely resulted from longer follow up (20years in NHANES I/NHEFS vs. 8–12 years in ARIC and NHS, respectively), a broader age range, and inclusion of self-reported physician diagnosis.The potential for periodontal disease to contribute to the development of RA is biologically plausible and has been previously hypothesized(Rosenstein et al., 2004, Lundberg et al.,2010). Chronic periodontal infections involve multiple gram-negative bacteria, including Porphyromonas gingivalis(Paster et al., 2006), which engage the innate immune system andresult in the chronic activation of antigen-presenting cells in the infected tissues. P.gingivalis is unique among periodontal pathogens in that it possesses a peptidyl arginine deiminase(McGraw et al., 1999, Wegner et al., 2010), which can citrullinated host peptides that in turn may elicit an anti-citrulline autoimmune response among genetically susceptible individuals. Accordingly, P. gingivalis induced extra-oral inflammatory lesions and periodontitis have been shown to promote or exacerbate arthritis in a animal models(Bartol Et al., 2010, Cantley et al., 2011).Accordingly, our biological hypothesis linking infection to RA partly relies on complex and relatively rare compound susceptibility genotypes(Klareskog et al., 2009) that likely exist inonly a small subgroup of the NHANES population; therefore, the magnitude of the reported associations are likely diluted by many nonsusceptible participants in our analysis. Early Epidemiologic work establishing cigarette smoking as an environmental risk for RA faced similar initial challenges in that they lacked data on HLA genotypes. These initial studies found weak and somewhat inconsistent associations between smoking duration/intensity andRA (Karlson et al., 1999, Criswell et al., 2002). Subsequent publications that could explore gene-environment interactions (Padyukov et al., 2004, Klareskog et al., 2006) demonstrated that in the context of relevant genetic susceptibilities, the RA risk posed by tobacco smoke was substantial. It is noteworthy that our current results for NHANES, which cannot incorporate data on HLA genotypes, also demonstrate weak, nonlinear, non statistically significant associations between smoking status and incident RA despite the fact there is very likely to be a strong causal association in genetically susceptible groups.Our current hypothesis suggests an alternate environmental risk factor – microbes – as a possible etiologic agent in the development of RA. While our findings minimize the likelihood that periodontal infections pose meaningful risk for RA development in the general population, more focused studies in genetically susceptible populations might be more informative as was the historical case with smoking and RA risk.Our incident RA outcome assessments were primarily based on participant self-report which created a high likelihood of biased incident RA ascertainment. NHANES participants with advanced tooth loss and periodontitis received fewer follow-up interviews as compared to participants who were periodontally healthy or missing only 0–4 teeth at baseline. If Underreporting of incident RA occurred at a higher rate among participants with advanced tooth loss and periodontal disease (as compared to periodontally healthy participants), andthe experience in the observed participants was applicable to the experience in participants who died or were lost to follow-up after 1982, the observed risk in these groups would be biased towards the null. Alternatively, since the case definition of RA was primarily determined by self-report the possibility of another form of ascertainment bias exists, in which participants with other arthritides might have falsely reported rheumatoid arthritis to the study.The current approach considered tooth loss as a surrogate exposure for historical periodontal infection since tooth loss is often the result of bacteria-induced, inflammatory processes andis a strong correlate of clinical periodontal disease (Jansson et al., 2002). Tooth loss is generally considered to be a reasonable surrogate measure of infectious exposure when investigating associations between periodontal infection and chronic disease outcomes(Wu Et al., 2000, Desvarieux et al., 2003, Joshipura et al., 2003, Hung et al., 2003, Desvarieux et al., 2004, Volzke et al., 2006, Demmer et al., 2008b). Although, tooth loss is produced by many causes, such as caries which might be highly relevant in this population, recent data demonstrate that caries prevalence is related to increased periodontal disease prevalence(Mattila et al., 2010). Moreover, dental procedures including tooth extractions(Rajasuo et al., 2004a, Rajasuo et al., 2004b, Kinane et al., 2005) have been shown to induce bacteremias thereby enabling oral microbes to gain systemic access irrespective of treatment indication and as importantly oral microbes, once systemic, can remain viable(Rafferty et al., 2011). Finally, in these data greater tooth loss was more strongly associated with incident RATE among participants with evidence of baseline gingivitis and periodontitis leading to a hypothesis that tooth loss might only be relevant in the context of existing oral infection/inflammation.Russell’s Periodontal Index (PI) was used to summarize the clinical periodontal condition of participants (Russell, 1956). Although it did not include linear measures of attachment loss and probing depth or assess bleeding from the marginal gingiva or pocket, the Index has been shown to correlate well to clinical and radiographic diagnosis (Russell, 1956). As Importantly, NHANES has only one baseline assessment of periodontal status and tooth number precluding a more precise characterization of periodontal status throughout the follow-up period.We have found the associations between periodontal status, tooth loss and both prevalent and incident RA to be consistently positive in direction but nonlinear and generally not statistically significant in the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Its Epidemiological Follow-Up Study. The overall patterns observed make it difficult to draw firm conclusions but it is unlikely that periodontal infections represent a strong RA risk factor in the general U.S. population. Future studies that can reduce RA ascertainment bias, incorporate more precise measures of exposure to periodontal microbes and measure relevant HLA genotypes will be necessary for more focused causal inference and definitive conclusions.Acknowledgments FUNDING This work was supported by NIH grant R00 DE-018739 to R.T.D.",-,"AL-KARMA MK, BISSADA NF, BORDEAUX JM, SUE J, ASKARI AD.

Association of Periodontal Disease and Tooth Loss with Rheumatoid Arthritis in the US Population,"PAOLA de PABLO, THOMAS DIETRICH, and TIMOTHY E. McALINDON","Objective. To test for an association of periodontitis and tooth loss with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Methods. The third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) is a nationally
representative cross-sectional survey of noninstitutionalized civilians. We included participants aged ≥
60 years who had undergone both musculoskeletal and dental examinations. RA was defined based on
American College of Rheumatology criteria. Dental examinations quantified decayed and filled surfaces,
missing teeth, and periodontitis. Periodontitis was defined as at least 1 site exhibiting both attachment
loss and a probing depth of ≥ 4 mm. We classified dental health status as (1) no periodontitis, (2) periodontitis, or (3) edentulous (i.e., complete tooth loss). We performed multivariate multinomial logistic
regression models with dental health status as the dependent and RA as the independent variables.
Results. The sample consisted of 4461 participants, of whom 103 were classified as having RA.
Participants with RA had more missing teeth (20 vs 16 teeth; p < 0.001), but less decay (2% vs 4%;
p < 0.001) than participants without RA. After adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking, subjects with RA were more likely to be edentulous [odds ratio (OR) 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI)
1.56–3.31] and have periodontitis (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.04–3.20) compared with non-RA subjects. In
participants with seropositive RA there was a stronger association with dental health status, in particular with edentulism (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.2–17).
Conclusion. RA may be associated with tooth loss and periodontitis. (First Release Nov 15 2007;

Key Indexing Terms:
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS
TOOTH LOSS
PERIODONTAL DISEASE
EDENTULISM","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease
characterized by synovial inflammation that results in destruction of joint tissues. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory
disease characterized by loss of the periodontal ligament and
alveolar bone, and is a major cause of tooth loss, particularly
in the elderly 1. Tooth loss has important clinical consequences,
including reduced dietary quality and quality of life 2,3.
Periodontitis and RA appear to share numerous characteristics including certain pathogenic processes 4,5, cytokine
profiles 6, markers of inflammation 7,8, association with HLA DRB 19,10, interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß) and tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) polymorphisms 11-14, presence of citrullinated proteins and peptide epitopes 4, and rheumatoid factor (RF)4,15,16.
This suggests that subjects susceptible to RA may also have
higher rates of periodontal disease.
Further, there are reasons to suspect that the role of periodontitis in RA might be based on more than just shared susceptibility. For example, induction of adjuvant arthritis in
Lewis male rats is associated with periodontal breakdown,
increased cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in gingival
tissues, and alveolar bone loss 17.
Studies have also demonstrated an antibody response
against oral anaerobic bacteria in synovial tissue 18 and
serum 19, and the presence of oral bacterial DNA in the synovial fluid and serum of patients with RA20. Also, periodontal
pathogens may express the peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD)
enzyme responsible for citrullination of peptide antigens 4.
Indeed, several clinical studies suggest a possible association
between periodontitis/tooth loss and RA21-25, although some
studies did not find a positive association 26-28. However, no population-based data on this association have been reported.
Our objective was to compare periodontal disease and
tooth loss prevalence in subjects with and without RA in the
US population. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source. Data were derived from the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III), a representative survey conducted
between 1988 and 1994 to study the health and nutritional status of the civilian noninstitutionalized US population 29,30. In brief, the survey included
home interviews and medical and dental examinations performed by a physician and a dentist, respectively, in a mobile examination center. The musculoskeletal examination was performed in subjects aged 60 years or older.
Upper and lower extremity examinations documented pain and swelling of
the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, wrists, knees, and first
metatarsophalangeal joints, and the presence of rheumatoid nodules. Presence
and duration of morning joint stiffness for at least 6 weeks, lasting for more
than 1 h, and other symptoms of inflammatory arthritis such as joint tenderness and swelling were ascertained by interview.
Clinical dental examinations. The standardized dental health examination
consisted of a visual and tactile dental examination performed by a licensed
dentist specially trained in the use of specific epidemiological indices for oral
health. The comprehensive dental examination assessed caries, restorations,
presence of third molars, number of missing teeth, and periodontal measures.
The oral health component of the survey has been described in detail 31, as
have detailed analyses of periodontitis in this sample10.
Periodontitis was assessed with a periodontal probe that was inserted into
the gingival crevice between the teeth and gums. Periodontal measurements
(attachment loss and probing depth) were performed at the mesiobuccal and
mid buccal site of all fully erupted teeth — except third molars — in 2 randomly selected quadrants. Clinical attachment loss is a cumulative measure of
the destruction of the tooth-supporting connective tissue and alveolar bone
and is measured as the distance between the cemento-enamel junction and the
bottom of the periodontal pocket. Attachment loss due to periodontitis is typically accompanied by a deepening of the periodontal pocket, measured as
probing depth, the distance between the free gingival margin and the bottom
of the pocket. Periodontitis was defined as the presence of at least 1 site with
both attachment loss and probing depth ≥ 4 mm, as described 31.
Caries was quantified as the proportion of decayed tooth surfaces among
all surfaces of all present teeth. Similarly, the proportion of decayed or filled
surfaces was calculated as a measure of caries history.
Oral examinations were performed by trained and calibrated examiners.
Detailed data regarding the reliability of the oral assessments and measurements have been reported 31.
Outcome definition. The primary outcome variable was classified in mutually exclusive categories as: (1) dentate without periodontitis (reference group),
(2) dentate with periodontal disease, or (3) edentulous (i.e., no natural teeth). Classification of RA. We defined RA based on a modification of the 1987
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for classification of RA32.
Participants who met at least 3 of 6 available ACR criteria were defined as
having RA as described 33, as all of the criteria, except radiographic data, were
available from NHANES III. Briefly, Rasch, et al evaluated the agreement
between 3 different classification methods for RA in NHANES III including
the method we used 33. The classification agreement between these methods
was excellent (κ = 0.879 and κ = 0.921). In addition, we performed a sensitivity analysis using a definition of RA based on the presence of 4 ACR criteria for classification of RA.
ACR criteria included the presence of morning stiffness for at least 1 h for
at least 6 weeks; physician’s examination findings (presence of arthritis in 3
or more joint areas, presence of arthritis in the joints of the hand, presence of
symmetric arthritis, presence of rheumatoid nodules); and positive RF. The
presence of RF was determined from blood samples using the Singer-Plotz
latex agglutination test. Blood specimens were screened using latex-enhanced
nephelometry prior to obtaining a title 34. Participants with ≤ 2 ACR criteria
were defined as not having RA. Other variables. Demographic information included age, sex, race/ethnicity,
education level, and poverty index. Race/ethnicity was classified as non Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Mexican-American. Education was
coded as the number of years of formal education completed. The poverty income ratio was computed as the ratio of family income versus the poverty
threshold as produced annually by the Census Bureau. Thus, the higher the
family income relative to the poverty threshold, the higher the poverty income
ratio 29. Smoking status and diabetes mellitus were assessed during the household interview. Respondents were classified as never-smokers (< 100 cigarettes in their lifetime), former smokers (≥ 100 lifetime cigarettes, not currently smoking), and current smokers (≥ 100 lifetime cigarettes, currently
smoking). Current smoking status was further stratified by the number of cigarettes smoked per day (up to 10 and ≥ 11 cigarettes/day). Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as weight/height 2. Total hip bone mineral density
(BMD) was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Physical
activity was defined based on leisure-time physical activity. Frequency of
dental care was defined based on self-report of the number of visits to dentist
per year, and dichotomized as visits to dentist at least once a year versus less
frequently. Statistical analyses. Summary statistics are presented as means ± standard
deviations (± SD) for continuous measures and frequencies for all discrete
variables. Univariate comparisons were made using the Student t-test or chi square test as appropriate. The association between RA and periodontal disease/tooth loss was analyzed using multinomial logistic regression models
with periodontal disease/tooth loss as the dependent and RA as the independent variables, adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity first, and second, with
further adjustment for poverty income ratio, education, smoking, diabetes,
BMI, and physical activity. In a secondary exploratory analysis, we further
adjusted the multivariate model for BMD. In a sensitivity analysis, we fitted
the same models using a more stringent definition of RA, which was based on
the presence of 4 ACR criteria for RA classification.
We examined the independent association of RF with periodontal disease/tooth loss in a multinomial logistic regression model, adjusting for age,
sex, race, and smoking, in a subset analysis stratified by RA status. With
stratification the sample size for each group decreased, thus limiting the
number of covariates included in the model. Finally, among dentate participants, we examined the relationship between dental care and RA status using
chi-square test. We performed all statistical analyses with Stata 7.0 (Stata Corp.,
College Station, TX, USA) accounting for survey clustering and stratification. To obtain population prevalence estimates of periodontitis and tooth
loss in RA compared with non-RA participants, sampling weights were used
as appropriate.RESULTS
There were 5302 individuals aged 60 years and older who had
a musculoskeletal examination, of whom 4535 had a dental
examination including periodontal attachment level measurements. Of these, 74 subjects were excluded due to missing
data on the dental clinical assessments and covariates, leaving
4461 individuals for analysis. Among those, 103 participants
were classified as having RA. Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features, and dental health status of RA and non participants are shown in Table 1. Among RA participants,
57% were women, 61% non-Hispanic White, 16% non Hispanic Black, 23% Mexican-American, and 29% seropositive. There were no differences in smoking habits, physical
activity, BMI, and BMD (Table 1). Dental health status. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the
sample. Participants with RA had a higher prevalence of periodontitis (weighted prevalence 16% vs 10%) and edentulism
(weighted prevalence 56% vs 34%) compared with non-RA
(p < 0.0001). Participants with RA also had more missing
teeth (20 vs 16 missing teeth; p = 0.0001), but a significantly lower frequency of decay (2% vs 4%; p < 0.001), and a slightly lower frequency of filled or decayed surfaces (21% vs 24%;
p = 0.3) compared with non-RA (Table 1). Participants with RA were more likely to be edentulous
[odds ratio (OR) 2.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56–3.31] compared with non-RA subjects. Similarly, among
dentate participants, individuals with RA were more likely to
have periodontitis (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.04–3.20), independently of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking (Table 2). These
associations were maintained in a multivariate model further
adjusting for education, poverty income ratio, smoking, diabetes, BMI, and physical activity (edentulous: OR 2.13, 95%
CI 1.35–3.36 and periodontitis: OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.92–3.32).
In a secondary exploratory analysis, the multivariate model
further adjusting for BMD showed similar results (edentulous:
OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.49–3.51 and periodontitis: OR 1.43, 95%
CI 0.69–2.97). RA definition based on the presence of 4 ACR criteria. In a
sensitivity analysis, participants with RA based on presence of
4 ACR criteria showed a stronger association with periodontal disease/tooth loss (edentulous: OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.16–9.64
and periodontitis: OR 4.13, 95% CI 1.30–13.15), independent
of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking. Presence of RF. Participants with seropositive RA were more
likely to be edentulous (OR 4.50, 95% CI 1.2–17) than those
with seronegative RA, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, sex,
and smoking (Table 3). Participants with seropositive RA had
more than twice the odds of periodontitis (OR 2.20, 95% CI
0.4–13.1) than those with seronegative RA, adjusting for age,
race/ethnicity, sex, and smoking; however, the difference was
not statistically significant due to the reduced sample size.
Seropositivity itself was not independently associated with
being edentulous (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.85–1.68) or having
periodontitis (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.73–1.57) among participants without RA (Table 3).
Dental care. Overall, participants with RA had less regular
dental care (23% vs 34% visited the dentist at least once a
year; p = 0.03) than non-RA participants (Table 1). Even when
the analysis was confined to dentate participants, those with
RA tended to have less frequent dental care than those without RA (38% vs 47% visited the dentist at least once a year;
p = 0.1), and there was no difference in dental care frequency
among subjects with periodontitis and those without periodontitis among dentate participants with RA (Table 4). DISCUSSION
In this population sample, participants with RA (based on 3/6
ACR criteria) were more than twice as likely to have complete tooth loss compared with non-RA participants. Further, this
association was largely preserved after adjusting for a number
of potential biases including age, sex, race/ethnicity, income,
education, smoking, diabetes, BMI, BMD, and physical activity. RA was also associated with an almost 2-fold increase in
the odds of periodontal disease. The association with complete tooth loss was particularly strong for those with seropositive RA. Similarly, the association was stronger in a sensitivity analysis based on a more stringent definition of RA based
on the presence of 4 ACR criteria for classification of RA.
The finding that seropositivity among participants with RA
was associated with complete tooth loss is intriguing. RF in
RA has been associated with a more severe disease course and
extra articular manifestations. Interestingly, previous studies
have reported the presence of RF in gingiva, subgingival
plaque, and serum of subjects with periodontitis 15,16.
A notable observation was that RF was present in 29%
among those with RA, while published series of patients with
RA indicate a higher prevalence of RF. It is possible that persons with severe RA could have missed the mobile examination evaluation due to severe disability or that a high proportion of participants classified as RA based on 3/7 ACR criteria, instead of 4/7 ACR criteria, have a mild or less severe disease or an early, undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis.
Given the stronger association between periodontitis/tooth
loss and seropositive RA, our results may therefore underestimate the association between periodontitis/tooth loss and RA.
This is also consistent with our findings of a stronger association between periodontitis/tooth loss and RA based on a more
stringent definition of 4 ACR criteria for classification of RA.
Alternatively, seronegative RA may be more prevalent in this
sample. Indeed, biases associated with referral (such as RF
detection itself) and classification criteria could have inflated
its apparent frequency in clinical samples. Population-based
studies have found lower rates of seropositive RA (26% to
60%)35-38 and a decline in the prevalence of seropositive
RA 39-41. In addition, Rasch, et al evaluated the agreement
between 3 different classification methods for RA in
NHANES III including the method we used 33. The classification agreement between these methods was excellent (κ =
0.879 and κ = 0.921), which adds to the validity of this
approach, as one of the case definition methods incorporated
the use of antirheumatic drugs.
In addition to having a common underlying proinflammatory trait, there are several mechanisms that could result in
increased periodontitis and tooth loss among individuals with
RA, of which low BMD, medications used for RA therapy,
xerostomia due to Sjögren’s syndrome, and differences in
dental healthcare are all strong contenders.
For a number of reasons, including the inflammatory
process itself, osteopenia is common in people with RA.
Osteoclast activation seems to be the dominant process leading to bone loss in RA, mediated through the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)/RANK pathway 42.
Several studies have reported positive associations between
osteoporosis or low bone density and alveolar bone loss (i.e.,
periodontitis), indicating that osteoporosis may be a risk factor for periodontitis 43. In addition, studies suggest that in the
elderly, maintenance of BMD is associated with improved
tooth retention; however, the evidence is still inconclusive 44.
We conducted an exploratory analysis to evaluate if differences in BMD may explain the association between RA and periodontitis/tooth loss. Adjustment for BMD did attenuate
the association only slightly, suggesting that osteoporosis may
not be an important factor in the association between RA and
periodontitis/tooth loss in this sample, although this does not
rule out the possibility of alveolar osteopenia.
Medications used for treatment of RA, rather than the disease itself, could affect the association between RA and periodontal disease/tooth loss. However, most of the drugs used to
treat RA are likely to reduce the risk of periodontitis and/or its
progression. Indeed, there is robust evidence that nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs have beneficial effects on periodontal
outcomes 45. Similarly, more recent evidence from animal
models indicates that RA therapy with biologics (i.e., anti TNF drugs) may improve experimental periodontitis 46,47.
Some patients with RA may have secondary Sjögren’s syndrome48, which has been associated with accelerated decay
and tooth loss 49-51, but it has not been associated with periodontal disease 51-54. However, in our study, participants with
RA had a significantly lower proportion of decayed surfaces
and a similar proportion of decayed/filled surfaces compared
with non-RA, suggesting that caries (and, by inference, xerostomia) are less likely explanations for our finding of increased
tooth loss in RA.
Tooth loss is the final outcome of a multifactorial process,
which involves biological processes (i.e., dental disease such
as periodontitis and decay) as well as non biological processes
related to dental treatment including health behaviors, patient
preferences, available treatment options, and access to dental
care. For example, it is possible that patients with RA might
visit dentists less frequently and that dentists might favor
extractions of diseased teeth in patients with RA. We found
that participants with RA had a lower frequency of regular
dental care compared with non-RA participants, even when
the analysis was confined to dentate individuals; however, it is
possible that these differences are explained by confounding
factors such as socioeconomic status.
Strengths of our study include its population-based sample,
which minimized the potential for selection bias, and ability to
control for many of the potential confounders of the association between RA and periodontal disease/tooth loss. Although
causality could not be established, our results suggest that RA,
and in particular seropositive RA, is associated with increased
periodontitis and complete tooth loss.
Important limitations of our study are the relatively low
number of subjects with RA, resulting in wide confidence
intervals and limiting our ability to perform subgroup
analyses.
Notwithstanding these limitations, our findings have several important implications. First, mechanistic studies into the
links between periodontitis and RA and the possible causal
role of oral infections in RA pathogenesis are warranted.
Second, longitudinal studies are necessary to establish the
temporal relationship between RA and periodontitis/tooth
loss. Third, regardless of whether the association between RA and periodontitis/tooth loss is causal or the result of a common
proinflammatory phenotype, our findings suggest that periodontitis and tooth loss are highly prevalent in older patients
with RA and that regular dental care should be advocated by
rheumatologists.",-,"1. Phipps KR, Stevens VJ. Relative contribution of caries and

Influence of Denture Plaque Biofilm onOral Mucosal Membrane in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"D. Przybyłowska, E. Mierzwin ́ska-Nastalska, R. Rubinsztajn,R. Chazan, D. Rolski, and E. Swoboda-Kopec ́","Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have the lower airways colonized with pathogenic bacteria in a stable period of the disease and during exacerbations. The etiology of bacterial exacerbations of COPD depends on the underlying disease, the frequency of exacerbations and antibiotic therapy. Microorganisms can be aspirated off the denture plaque biofilm into the lower respiratory tract and could reduce the patient's immunity and cause pneumonia. COPD patients, who are using acrylic dentures in oral cavity, are exposed to denture stomatitis and oral candidiasis. The aim of this study was to establish the composition of dental plaque biofilm and its impact on the oral mucosa in COPD patients. The study included patients in a stable phase of COPD using removable denture and the control group included healthy wearer’s appliances. Examinations Concerned the oral mucosal membrane and the hygienic condition of prosthetic restorations. Microbiological examinations were performed by taking a direct swab from the surface of acrylic dentures. Seventeen bacterial and fungal strains were isolated from denture plaque of COPD patients, which could be a reservoir of pathogens in the upper and lower airways. The results showed a greater frequency of prosthetic stomatitis complicated by mucosal infections among COPD patients compared to healthy subjects.Keywords Candida albicans• COPD • Denture stomatitis • Oral hygiene • Respiratory pathogens","Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) isone of major diseases where oral bacteria bear significant degree of responsibility for exacerbations. International studies showed that poor oral hygiene has an influence on pneumonia infections. A substantial part of nosocomial pneumonias start with the aspiration of oral bacteria from the mouth or nasopharynx to the lower respiratory tract (Paju and Scannapieco 2007).Respiratory tract pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella Catarrhalis,Pseudomonas Aeruginosa,Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and others,and also Candida spp. fungi, leading a saprophytic existence in the mucosa, are responsible for over 50 % of exacerbations of COPD (Sethi 2004).Those microorganisms exist in the form of organized structures forming an ecological niche called biofilm. The pathogenicity of a microorganism is reflected in its capacity to form biofilm,which directly affects oral tissues and the lower respiratory tract (Scannapieco 2006). The presence of bacteria in the airways of patients with COPD implies a breach of host defense mechanisms, which sets up a vicious cycle of epithelial cell damage and impaired mucociliary clearance (Sethi et al.2009). There is increased submucosal vascular leakage and inflammatory cell infiltration, thereby developing dysfunction of host defenses and bacterial adherence and growth. Microorganisms might cause antigen release, including endotoxins, lipoproteins,peptidoglycans and other molecules, which increases inflammatory reactions in the respiratory tract and elsewhere. Removable acrylic dentures in the mouth create favorable conditions to promote bacterial and fungal microflora colonization. Denture biofilm is a mix of fungal and bacterial biofilm where complex interactions occur between. albicans and other oral microorganisms.COPD patients are saddled with high risk of bacterial and fungal infections, particularly Candida spp. A chronic local oral inflammation, whilewearing dentures, and systemic inflammationimpede the mucociliary clearance of patients.Molecular studies of sputum isolates duringexacerbations of COPD have shown the presenceof fresh bacterial strains. Their finding in the spu-tum sample depends largely on the way the forcedexpiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) measurement isperformed (Liu et al.2012). Long-term inhaledglucocorticoid therapy, and the frequent necessityof including systemic glucocorticoids andantibiotics in case of disease exacerbation,influences the immune system. Inhalation chemo-therapy and home oxygen therapy alter the envi-ronmental conditions in the mouth, causingdryness which obstructs saliva flow and impedesits antiseptic properties. It is important to investi-gate the prevalence of prosthetic stomatitis withyeast-like fungus infections in these patients,which may cause the development of systemiccandidiasis. Interdisciplinary studies of the rela-tionship between oral hygiene, dental restorationsand general condition of patients with COPD mayenable more control over the course of the diseaseand reduce the medical expenses.2MethodsThe study was performed with approval of a localEthics Committee of Warsaw Medical Universityin Poland and was performed in accord with Dec-laration of Helsinki for Human Research. A groupof 37 denture wearers who were hospitalizedCOPD patients in a stable phase of diseaseparticipated in this study. The control groupincluded 14 healthy users of prosthetic appliances.The COPD group consisted of 11 women and26 men (age range: 53–88 years, mean age:708.2 years). The inclusion criteria were theabsence of active oral disease and no history ofantibiotic therapy within the previous 8 weeks.All COPD patients were clinically diagnosedand the disease was confirmed by lung functionexamination. Lung function was measured usingspirometry (Lung Test 1000; MES, Cracow,Poland). Airway obstruction was defined bypost-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC<0.7. Table1summarizes the patents’ clinical characteristics.Clinical and laboratory studies included initialsymptoms, interview about pain, burning sensation, and feeling dryness in the mouth.Intraoral examination was conducted by one ofthe authors. We examined the oral mucosamembranes and the hygienic condition of pros-thetic appliances. Additionally, microbiologicalexaminations included a direct swab from thesurface of the dentures. The hygiene of acrylicmouth dentures was assessed using a modifiedAmbjørnsen et al. (1982) method for plaque eval-uation in five areas of the denture: in three areasof the denture surface and two of the workingside surfaces. Hygienic level was evaluated bythe following criteria: no discernible dentureplaque on visual examination or scrubbing witha dental instrument – good hygiene (0), moderateplaque covering part of the denture visible atexamination – insufficient hygiene (1), and den-ture covered with visible plaque -poor hygiene(2). Denture stomatitis was diagnosed and classi-fied according to modified Newton classification.Class 0 included patients with no inflammatorychanges in oral mucosa, who complained ofsubjective syndroms, Class 1 included patientswith pinpoints of surface inflammation on anunaltered mucosal membrane, Class 2 includedpatients with widespread inflammations underthe denture, and Class 3 included cases withmucosal hyperplasia close to the denture.Direct swabs were collected from acrylic den-ture surfaces and used for microbiological tests.The sample was immediately transported inTranswab containers to the Department of Medi-cal Microbiology of Warsaw Medical University.Specimens were inoculated on liquid and gelmedium, using Columbia agar with 5 % sheepblood and Chapman and MacConkey agar(bioMerieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France). Plateswere incubated for 48 h at 37C in an aerobiccondition. Bacteriological identification wasperformed according to morphological and bio-chemical characteristics, using the bioMerie ́uxtests (Marcy-l’Etoile, France). Mycological inoc-ulation was performed on the Sabouraud agar,where the yeast-like fungi were incubated at30C for 48 h in the presence of oxygen.CHROMagar Candida selective medium(BioRad, Hercules, CA) and the assimilativeID32 C strip (bioMerie ́ux; Marcy-l’Etoile,France) were used for fungal growth analysisand identification. All microbiological samplingwas conducted by a single examiner. Data wereanalyzed with at-test with a statistical signifi-cance defined as p<0.05.3ResultsAerobic bacteria were isolated from 36 COPDpatients and 14 healthy denture users. Thirty-fourof the thirty-seven swab samples from patientswith COPD (91.9 %) yielded a positive culture ofone or more potentially pathogenicmicroorganisms. The detection rates of aerobicorganisms of denture plaques are summarized inFig.1.Candida spp.(43.9 %) andS. epidermidis(12.3 %) predominated in COPD patients andyeasts-like fungi (42.0 %) andS. epidermidis(10.5 %) in controls. A variety of bacteria poten-tially pathogenic for the respiratory systemcolonized the denture plaque in COPD patients. Among the isolates there were:S. aureus(5.3 %),K. pneumoniae(5.3 %),S. marcescens(5.3 %),Enterobacteriaceaespp. (7.0 %), andP. aeruginosa(1.8 %). In controls there werecases of growth ofA. lwoffii(10.5 %),E. coli(5.3 %), andM. lacunata(5.3 %).Of the COPD patients, 13.5 % were diagnosedwith Class II and 8.1 % with Class III prostheticstomatitis, compared with no evidence of stoma-titis in controls (Table2). We further found that70.3 % of the hospitalized patients werediagnosed with denture stomatitis complicatedby mucosal fungi infection, compared with50.0 % in the control. The COPD patients had more frequent diagnoses of Newton Class I(51.3 %), whereas the control group had Newtonclass 0 (78.6 %) for the most part.Poor prosthetic appliance hygiene based on the modified index plaque by Ambjørnsenet al. (1982) pointed to negligence in cleaning dentures used by patients with COPD (Table3).Abundant denture plaque was observed in 27 %of COPD patients and only 7 % of controls. Immoderate accumulation of denture plaque was found in 54 % COPD patients and 43 % controls.There was no evidence of denture plaque in 19 %of patients with COPD.4Discussion The present study demonstrates that the bacteriological and mycological examination of the acrylic denture plaque is a valuable component of the assessment of patients with COPD. Previous authors have also confirmed the presence of pathogenic strains of bacteria in the airways during a stable COPD. Induced sputum samples were examined in those studies. The Presence of pathogenic strains was found in almost 52 % of patients and it was associated with increased exacerbation frequency over the study period (Patel et al.2002). We showed in this study a much larger proportion of patients with pathogenic bacteria in denture plaques(91.9 %). This could suggest that the oral cavity is a huge reservoir of potential pathogens in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Fever and bacterial respiratory infections may develop as a result of poor oral hygiene. The studies performed in patients with COPD revealed cases ofS. aureus colonization,Serratia spp.,Klebsiella pneumoniae,and Pseudomonas spp.(Patel et al.2002). In the present study, largely Gram-negative bacteria were found. This group of microorganisms is commonly present in the elderly. The additional risk factor in these patients is the use of prosthetic appliances in the mouth. Sumi et al. (2002) have also detected potential pathogens in denture plaques in the elderly. Their results show that the greatest part of microorganisms isolated were the following:Candida spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella Pneumoniae,and Staphylococcus aureus. Previous authors have also revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa mandS. aureus more frequently in dental plaques of hospitalized patients with chronic lung disease than from those of lung-healthy dental outpatients (Sumi et al.2007).The present study showed that poor denture hygiene may be responsible for high levels of Candida spp.and Gram-negative bacteria.There were more cases where denture stomatitis was complicated by mucosal fungal infection in COPD patients than in the control group, which can be explained by applying inhalation chemotherapy and home oxygen therapy through the mouth. The oral immune function of COPD patients, who are wearing dental prosthesis, is considered to deteriorate because of decreased saliva secretion and decreased concentration of host immune components. Using inhalation glucocorticosteroids and oxygen therapy causes dry mouth and thinning of oral mucosa. That Could be a first augur of membrane inflammation.Golecka et al. (2007) have revealed more prosthetic stomatitis and poor prosthetic appliance hygiene of patients after organ transplantation than in healthy patients. Oral and dental colonization by opportunistic respiratory pathogens has been considered a high risk of the incidence of respiratory diseases through aspiration (Sethi Et al.2009). Based on potential factors perturbing oral homeostasis, the routine of a physical examination of COPD patients should take into account the examination of oral and prosthetic appliances hygiene.In conclusions, rigorous oral hygiene and denture appliances hygiene may be a preventive strategy against COPD exacerbations. An investigation of the relationship between oral hygiene and dental restorations and a general condition of COPD patients will make it possible to better control the course of the disease and to reduce the medical expenses.Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest in relation to this article.",-,"Ambjørnsen E, Valderhaug J, Norheim PW, Fløystrand F(1982) Assessment of an additive index for plaque accumulation on complete maxillary dentures.

Oral health in older patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia,"OMAR ORTEGA, CARLOS PARRA, SILVIA ZARCERO,JOSENART, OLGASAKWINSKA, PERECLAVÉ","Background: oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD), aspiration and poor oral health status are potential risk factors in elderly patients with aspiration pneumonia (AP).Aim: to assess the oral hygiene status and the prevalence of periodontal disease and dental caries in elderly patients with OD.Patients and methods:fifty elderly patients (79.7 ± 6.64 years) with OR associated with ageing or neurological diseases and 15 elderly patients without OD (77.01 ± 4.51 years) were enrolled in this observational–transversal study. OD and aspiration were evaluated by videofluoroscopy (VFS). Oral health was assessed by: (i) the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S); (ii) a complete periodontal examination, assessing the periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing to study periodontal diseases (periodontitis, gingivitis); and (iii) the presence of dental caries.Results: 8/50 elderly patients with OD presented VFS signs of aspiration, half of them silent; 40/50, signs of penetration into laryngeal vestibule and 16/50, oropharyngeal residue. Prevalence of edentulism and caries was higher in patients with OD.Dentate older patients with OD (30/50) presented the following complications (i) poor oral hygiene in 18 patients (OHI-S3.1–6), (ii) gingivitis in 2 and periodontitis in 28 and (iii) caries in 16.Conclusions: older patients with OD presented polymorbidity and impaired health status, high prevalence of VFS signs of impaired safety of swallow and poor oral health status with high prevalence of periodontal diseases and caries. These patients are at great risk of developing AP. We recommend a policy of systematic oral health assessment in elderly patients with OD.Keywords:Swallowing disorders, elderly, oral hygiene, periodontal diseases, aspiration pneumonia, older people","Introduction The incidence and prevalence of aspiration pneumonia (AP)in the community are poorly defined. The pathogenesis of AP presumes the contribution of risk factors that alter swallowing function, causing oropharyngeal aspiration, bacterial colonisation and impaired immunity. The risk of these factors increases with age, underlying diseases and polymorbidity.Surprisingly, in the clinical setting, oropharyngeal dysphagia(OD) and aspiration are not usually considered aetiological factors in older patients with pneumonia [1].The quantity and type of microbiota in aspirate, greatly affected by oral health, contribute to the development of AP[2]. In healthy mouths, oral biofilm is colonised by commensal microflora which acts as a barrier against the colonisation of respiratory pathogens. Poor oral health reduces these bacteria, allowing the growth of pathogenic populations and changing the balance from a majority of Gram-positive microorganisms in healthy mouths to mostly Gram-negative in patients with periodontitis and caries [3]. Studies have found that impaired oral health status and oral diseases are important risk factors for AP and independent predictors of mortality from pneumonia in the elderly [2–4]. A recent editorial called for systematic screening of OD and Gram-negative bacterial colonisation in polymorbid older patients to prevent AP [5]. The combined effect of comorbidities,frailty, decreased immunological status, OD and poor oral health can lead to AP, hospital readmissions and death [6,7].Oral health of elderly dysphagic patients has not been systematically studied. The aim of this observational–transversal study is to assess the oral hygiene status, the prevalence of oral diseases and oral hygiene habits, the health status and comorbidities in this population.Material and Methods Patient sample Population consisted of elderly patients consecutively referred for swallowing evaluation. Main inclusion criteria were age≥70 and history of swallowing difficulties associated with ageing and/or neurological diseases. A control group of elderly patients with similar age and without OD was also included.Experimental design Health status and comorbidities were assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity Index [8].The Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10)[9], a questionnaire to evaluate the severity of dysphagia symptoms, was collected in all subjects. Patients with swallowing complaints were also evaluated by videofluoroscopy (VFS)[10]. Oral health was assessed by the evaluation of periodontal diseases, dental caries, oral hygiene status and oral health habits. All procedures were performed on the same day.Dysphagia assessment by VFS The technical process used for VFS recordings has been described elsewhere [10,11]. VFS signs of impaired safety were classified according to Penetration–Aspiration Scale [12].Oral health assessment Oral examinations were performed by two periodontists and included: (i) number of teeth, (ii) oral hygiene, (iii) periodontal diseases, (iv) caries and (v) oral health habits.Oral hygiene We used the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S), composed of two indexes: the Debris Index (DI-S, dental plaque,) and the Calculus Index (CI-S, mineralised debris).The CI-S and DI-S values range from 0 to 3; the OI-Values range from 0 to 6 [13] (Figure1).Periodontal disease Periodontal diseases were assessed by introducing a periodontal probe along the soft tissue wall at the gingival sulcus/pocket. Diagnosis was made using an established protocol [14].Caries Caries were assessed at each dental surface (four surfaces of incisors and canines;five for premolars and molars). We Measured the percentage of teeth with caries and surfaces affected [15].Oral hygiene habits questionnaire was used to determine tooth-brushing frequency, use of mouthwash, use of dentures and last visit to the dentist.Data management and statistical analysis Qualitative data are presented as relative frequencies and ana-lysed by theχ2-test and continuous data are presented as mean ± SD and compared with the Mann–WhitneyU-test.Safety and efficacy of deglutition were assessed by prevalence of clinical or VFS signs.P-values of <0.05 were considered significant.Results Demographics and health status We studied 50 consecutive elderly patients with swallowing impairment between January and May 2011, (27 women)with a mean age of 79.7 ± 6.64 years. OD was associated with stroke (29/50), ageing (16/50) and neurodegenerative diseases (5/50). The mean Charlson comorbidity score was2.98 ± 1.83 [8] and the mean EAT-10 score was 10.5 ± 7.6.Mean number of drugs taken by patients was 7.56 ± 2.97.In addition, a group of 15 elderly controls (six women)with a mean age of 77.09 ± 4.51 years without IT was studied. The mean Charlson comorbidity score was 1.4 ± 1.12 (P= 0.0023 versus OD) and the mean EAT-10 score was 0.23 ± 0.6 (P< 0.0001 versus OD).VFS signs of ODVFS showed that prevalence of signs of impaired safety (29/50)and efficacy (38/50) of deglutition in the group with ID was very high. According to the Penetration–Aspiration Scale [12], 21/50 OF patients presented mild penetrations(scores 2–3); 15/50, severe penetrations into the laryngeal vestibule (scores 4–5); and 8/50, aspirations into the airway(scores 6–8) (Supplementary data are available in Age and Ageing online, Appendix Figure S2). A total of 9/50 patients also presented chewing difficulties (Supplementary data are available in Age and Ageing Online, Appendix 1).Oral health patients 20/50 patients presented edentulism and needed dentures to eat with. The following results are for dentate patients(30/50): (i) mean number of teeth was 17 ± 8.3; (ii) OHIO results showed high prevalence of patients with poor oral hygiene (3.86 ± 1.51) (Figure 2); (iii) a total of 28 dentate patients presented periodontitis (6, mild; 11, moderate; and11, severe), two had gingivitis and none had healthy clinical oral status (P< 0.0001). More than half (16) had caries with up to 23.05% ± 0.16 of dental pieces affected in each patient and 8.21% ± 5.14 of the surfaces of each tooth affected.Only 33 patients reported cleaning their teeth or dentures at least once a day and only 11 patients had visited the dentist during the previous year.Control patients Only 1/15 patient presented edentulism (P= 0.0249 versus OD) and mean number of teeth was 18.1 ± 8.8. Among Patients with teeth (14), OHI-S mean value was 3.25 ± 1.35(Figure 2), 13 presented periodontitis and only 3, caries(P= 0.0456 versus OD) with a smaller percentage of teeth affected than patients with OD (7.63% ± 3.5,P= 0.022)(Supplementary data are available in Age and Ageing Online,Appendix Table S1and Appendix 3 and 4). Discussion Main results from this study show that older OF patients were at high risk of AP as they presented high prevalence of VFS signs of impaired safety of swallow, poor oral health status with high prevalence of periodontal diseases and caries, and impaired health status with prevalent comorbidities and polymedication.OD should be recognised as a major geriatric syndromes its prevalence is very high in elderly patients and leads to multiple diseases and risk factors [8]. Studies on healthy elderly over 80 years found that ageing delayed and prolonged swallow response and increased oropharyngeal residue [16]. Impaired swallow response is caused by neurological diseases as well as the neurodegenerative process related to ageing [17], drugs with detrimental effects on consciousness or swallow response [18] and reduced tongue strength caused by sarcopenia [9]. In addition, many of our patients presented chewing difficulties. We have recentlyfound that OD is an independent risk factor for the development of respiratory tract infections and community-acquired pneumonia in elderly patients [6,19]. Thus, the elderly, poly-morbid, polymedicated and frail phenotype are at high risk for AP as they present high prevalence of oropharyngeal aspiration, impaired resistance to infections and poor oral health, the three pathophysiological factors associated with AP [10]. Comorbidities and frailty are strongly related to impaired immunological status, periodontal diseases and oral colonisation by respiratory pathogens [7,8,10,18]. In addition, immune function in the oral cavity can be affected by oral residue after swallow and xerostomia [20].The oral health status of our OD patients was very poor.Prevalence of edentulism, the final complication of periodontal disease, was found to be higher (40%) in our OD patients compared with different studies on European senior citizens of similar ages [21–23] and with our control group.In addition, OD patients had more caries than controls.Both groups of patients presented high OHI-S values caused by poor oral health care, periodontitis and caries [13,24],slightly poorer in OD patients. In this process, the total number of bacteria is greatly increased from 102–103 bacterial cells in a healthy gingival sulcus to 105–109 bacteria with periodontitis [3]. Periodontal pathogens may facilitate the colonisation of the oral cavity by common pneumonia pathogens[4], and poor oral health has been associated with the appearance, severity and mortality of AP [2,25,26].The DI-S index measures the amount of the soft and fresh part of the biofilm while the CI-S describes the mineralized debris [27]. Our results suggest that daily tooth brushing would decrease OHI-S by 50% in ODI elderly patients and controls (Figure 2). A recent review found a preventive effect of mechanical oral hygiene on pneumonia and respiratory tract infection in elderly people in hospitals and nursing homes [28] and we can hypothesise that this effect would be greater among patients with OD with a higher risk for aspiration. Recently, the World Health Organization has recommended improving the oral health of the elderly.Furthermore, the US Centers for Disease Control recognises aspiration of oropharyngeal organisms as an important etiological route for the development of AP in elderly patients and recommends the implementation of‘comprehensive hygiene programs’[15]. We suggest two targets to reduce the risk of AP among frail elderly patients and the consequent high morbidity and mortality: (i) early screening, identification and treatment of patients with OD and aspiration using clinical methods applicable in all medical centres [11,19] and(ii) routine assessment of oral health, improvement of oral hygiene and appropriate treatment of oral diseases. In addition, due to the high prevalence of edentulism, chewing assessment could help to select the most appropriate dietary adjustment for these patients.Key points•Elderly patients with OD present high prevalence of VFS signs of impaired safety of swallow and aspiration.•Elderly patients with OD present poor oral health with poor oral hygiene and high prevalence of edentulism, periodontal diseases and caries.•Elderly patients with OD are at high risk of developing AP.•We recommend a policy of systematic evaluation and treatment of oral health among this population.Acknowledgements We thank Mrs Viridiana Arreola, Mr Alberto Martin andMrs Irene López for performing and helping in the dysphagia evaluation, to Mrs Jane Lewis for reviewing the manuscript, to Dr Harald Brüssow for his support during the study and to Mr Vicente Platón and Mr Rosario Puglisi for the additional dental evaluations performed.Funding This work was supported by grants from the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (IF063678-2, PS09/01012,INT 10/228), the Agencia de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris ide Recerca (2009 SGR 708) and Nestlé Health Science.Conflicts of interest PC. has served as consultant and received research funding from Nestlé Health Science.

Denture Wearing during Sleep Doubles the Risk of Pneumonia in the Very Elderly,"T. Iinuma, Y. Arai, Y. Abe, M. Takayama, M. Fukumoto, Y. Fukui, T. Iwase, T. Takebayashi, N. Hirose, N. Gionhaku, and K. Komiyama","Poor oral health and hygiene are increasingly recognized as major risk factors for pneumonia among the elderly. To identify modifiable oral health–related risk factors, we prospectively investigated associations between a constellation of oral health behaviors and incident pneumonia in the community-living very elderly (i.e., 85 years of age or older). At baseline, 524 randomly selected seniors (228 men and 296 women; mean age, 87.8 years) were examined for oral health status and oral hygiene behaviors as well as medical assessment, including blood chemistry analysis, and followed up annually until first hospitalization for or death from pneumonia. During a 3-year follow-up period, 48 events associated with pneumonia (20 deaths and 28 acute hospitalizations) were identified. Among 453 denture wearers, 186 (40.8%) who wore their dentures during sleep were at higher risk for pneumonia than those who removed their dentures at night (log rank P = 0.021). In a multivariate Cox model, both perceived swallowing difficulties and overnight denture wearing were independently associated with an approximately 2.3-fold higher risk of the incidence of pneumonia (for perceived swallowing difficulties, hazard ratio [HR], 2.31; and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11–4.82; and for denture wearing during sleep, HR, 2.38; and 95% CI, 1.25–4.56), which was comparable with the HR attributable to cognitive impairment (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.06–4.34), history of stroke (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.13–5.35), and respiratory disease (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.20–4.23). In addition, those who wore dentures during sleep were more likely to have tongue and denture plaque, gum inflammation, positive culture for Candida albicans, and higher levels of circulating interleukin-6 as compared with their counterparts. This study provide empirical evidence that denture wearing during sleep is associated not only with oral inflammatory and microbial burden but also with incident pneumonia, suggesting potential implications of oral hygiene programs for pneumonia prevention in the community.Key Words:oral hygiene,very old, infection, Candida albicans, pneumonitis, interleukin-6.","Introduction Pneumonia is a major morbidity and mortality risk among the elderly. The 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study reported that lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, are the fourth leading cause of death globally, and the second most frequent reason for years of life lost (Lozano et al. 2012). In Japan, pneumonia has ranked as the third leading cause of death since 2011, and the second leading cause of death among nonagenarians (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare 2012). Aspiration is an important pathogenic mechanism for pneumonia in the elderly, and poor oral health is increasingly recognized as a predisposing factor ( Janssens and Krause 2004). Indeed, randomized interventional trials demonstrated that professional oral care reduces the burden of pneumonia among the frail elderly in long-term care facilities (Adachi et al. 2002). It remains unknown, however, whether improving oral hygiene by altering behaviors could reduce the risk of pneumonia in community settings. With a rapid demographic shift toward the very elderly in the population and a concomitant increase in the global burden of poor oral condition (Marcenes et al. 2013), the development of a motivational and self-manageable oral health promotion program for pneumonia prevention is a matter of public health priority. To identify behavioral risk factors, modification of which could provide tangible benefits for pneumonia prevention, we prospectively investigated associations between a constellation of oral health behaviors and pneumonia events in the community-living very elderly.Methods Study Population The Tokyo Oldest Old Survey on Total Health (TOOTH) is an ongoing prospective observational study organized by interdisciplinary experts, including geriatricians, dentists, psychologists, and epidemiologists. Details of its design, its recruitment, and the entire procedure have been described previously (Arai et al. 2010). Between March 2008 and November 2009, we recruited a randomly selected sample of 542 inhabitants of Tokyo aged 85 years or older for medical and dental examination. Among them, 12 subjects were excluded because they lacked oral health assessment, and 6 were excluded because they did not have information on pneumonia incidence; thus, 524 subjects were included in the analysis (228 men and 296 women; mean ± SD age, 87.8 ± 2.2 years; range, 85–102 years).Oral Health Assessment The comprehensive oral health assessment comprised a face-to-face interview including oral health–related quality of life (QOL) (Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index [GOHAI]), the ability to eat 15 items of food, a questionnaire regarding oral health behaviors, and dental examination by dentists (Iinuma et al. 2012). To identify behavioral risk factors, we have developed a 13-item oral health–related and hygiene-related questionnaire (Appendix Table). The questionnaire includes 4 items on denture hygiene practices modified from the study by Evren et al. (2011): frequency of denture wearing, frequency of denture cleaning, usage of denture cleanser, and denture wearing during sleep. These items were applied for 453 denture wearers only. Perceived swallowing difficulty was assessed with an item from GOHAI, “How often are you able to swallow comfortably?” After the interview, the dentist performed an oral examination to assess oral status, the presence of dental plaque, and gum inflammation according to the Standard of Dental Examination in School Health and Safety Act ( Japanese School Dental Association 2007). Denture plaque was assessed using a modification of the Ambjørnsen Denture Plaque Index (Ambjørnsen et al. 1982). The presence of plaque on dentures was scored from 0 to 3 using the criteria proposed by Ambjørnsen, in which 0 is equivalent to no visible plaque, 1 is equivalent to plaque visible only by scraping on the denture base with a blunt instrument, 2 is equivalent to a moderate accumulation of dental plaque, and 3 is equivalent to an abundance of plaque. For 268 consecutive participants examined between April 2009 and November 2009, microbiological samples from the dorsal surface of the tongue were scraped 5 times with a sterilized cotton swab. The specimens were immediately inoculated onto special medium (CHROMagar Candida) for detection of Candida, according to a modification of the procedure of Wang et al. (2006).Medical Assessment At the same time as the dental examination, participants were interviewed and examined by trained geriatricians to assess medical conditions and medications, and to verify physical functional status (Barthel index). Cognitive function was evaluated according to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Nonfasting blood samples were obtained at baseline, and plasma concentrations of albumin, creatinine, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured using standard assay procedures. Plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were measured in duplicate using commercially available ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits (Quantikine HS [Human IL-6] and Quantikine HS [Human TNF-α], respectively; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Interassay coefficients of variation of IL-6 and TNF-α were 9.43%, and 8.72%, respectively.Outcomes The outcome of interest was a serious pneumonia event, which was defined as first hospitalization for or death from pneumonia. Participants were followed up for all-cause and cause-specific mortality and hospitalization from cancers, cardiovascular disease, pneumonia, falls and fractures, and other causes by telephone contact or mail survey conducted every 12 months. At month 36, those who remained in the cohort were examined according to the same protocol as the baseline survey, and any hospitalizations during the observational period were confirmed.Statistical Analysis All analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Baseline characteristics are expressed as means and standard deviations (SD) or as percentages. Continuous variables with a skewed distribution are described as medians (interquartile ranges [IQR]) and log-transformed for statistical analyses. We characterized denture wearing during sleep as either always (every night) or usually (5–6 nights/week). Differences in continuous variables at baseline were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. The chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables. For longitudinal analysis, we plotted Kaplan–Meier survival curves according to the risk strata. A prognostically significant result was defined as log-rank P < 0.05. We then used the univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model to assess the relative risk of incident pneumonia. First, biological and behavioral factors known to be associated with pneumonia mortality (age, sex, education, smoking status, low body mass index [<18.5], history of stroke, respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] and statins, and plasma levels of albumin, CRP, and IL-6) were calculated for hazard ratio (HR) in the univariate model; those with substantial associations (P < 0.1) were entered into the multivariate model. Because of the strong correlation between CRP and IL-6, they were entered separately in the model. Death from causes other than pneumonia was censored. In all analyses, P < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance.This research was approved by the Ethics Committees of Nihon University School of Dentistry (No. 2003-20, 2008) and Keio University School of Medicine (No. 20070047). The TOOTH is registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN)-Clinical Trial Registry (CTR) as UMIN-CTR (ID: UMIN000001842).Result During a 3-year follow-up period, 48 events associated with pneumonia (20 deaths and 28 acute hospitalizations) were identified, for an overall incidence of serious pneumonia of 3.1 per 100 per year. Seventy individuals died of other causes (cancer = 24; cardiovascular disease = 28; other causes = 15; and unknown causes = 3), 4 declined the follow-up survey, and 15 were censored at the time of last contact. The baseline characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. Those who developed pneumonia were more likely to have perceived swallowing difficulties, a habit of denture wearing during sleep, disability involving activities of daily living (ADL), cognitive impairment, lower body mass index (BMI), a history of respiratory disease and stroke, a lower level of albumin, and higher CRP and IL-6 levels. Neither remaining teeth, nor Eichner index score (Eichner 1990), nor medication intake showed any association with pneumonia.Because denture wearing during sleep was the only behavioral factor associated with pneumonia, we plotted Kaplan–Meier survival curves for cumulative incidence of pneumonia events according to this habit (Figure). Denture wearing during sleep was significantly associated with a higher risk of pneumonia (log rank P = 0.021).In a multivariate Cox model, both swallowing difficulties and denture wearing during sleep were independently associated with an approximately 2.3-fold higher risk of incident pneumonia (for perceived swallowing difficulties, HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.11–4.82; and for denture wearing during sleep, HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.25–4.56), which were comparable with the HR attributable to cognitive impairment (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.06–4.34), history of stroke (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.13–5.35), and respiratory disease (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.20–4.23). To test the robustness of our results, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we excluded ADL disability from the multivariate model. We found a consistent association between denture wearing during sleep and incident pneumonia (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.23–4.51). Another sensitivity analysis excluding those who died of causes other than pneumonia during the observation period (n = 70) demonstrated a solid association between denture wearing during sleep and pneumonia events in the multivariate model (HR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.21–4.65; P = 0.012). None of the other denture hygiene practices or factors related to oral health status, including the number of remaining teeth, Eichner index, or use of denture cleansers, were significantly associated with incident pneumonia.To gain mechanistic insight into the association between denture wearing during sleep and incident pneumonia, we examined baseline oral and denture status as well as systemic conditions in relation to denture habits (Table 3). Those who wore dentures during sleep were more likely to have tongue and denture plaque, gum inflammation, positive culture for Candida albicans, and higher levels of circulating IL-6 as compared with their counterparts. Thereafter, we incorporated each dental status item into the multivariate Cox model shown in Table 2, and we found that the associations between denture wearing during sleep and incident pneumonia were substantially attenuated and no longer statistically significant after further adjustment for gum inflammation or C. albicans (adjusted for gum inflammation, HR for overnight wearing, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.67–3.11; P = 0.344; and, adjusted for C. albicans, HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.66–4.46; P = 0.264), suggesting that the inflammatory and microbial burden of the oral cavity could provide a mechanistic link between denture wearing during sleep and incident pneumonia. The prevalence of ADL disability and coronary artery disease tended to be higher in nocturnal denture wearers than their counterparts; however, none of the systemic conditions had a significant impact on the relationship between denture wearing during sleep and incident pneumonia.Discussion In this prospective study of the community-dwelling very elderly aged 85 years or older, we found that perceived swallowing difficulties and denture wearing during sleep conferred a 2.3-fold higher risk of serious pneumonia events, which is comparable with those attributable to major predisposing factors of aspiration pneumonia, such as history of stroke and respiratory disease, and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, wearers of dentures during sleep tend to have poor denture hygiene practices, fewer dental office visits, denture and tongue plaque, and oral candidiasis, suggesting that this habit could be a sensitive marker for identifying individuals at high risk of both poor oral health and aspiration pneumonia.There have been few previous studies regarding the association between oral health status and pneumonia outcomes in the community setting. Awano et al. reported that the number of teeth with periodontal pockets was associated with higher mortality from pneumonia in the very elderly aged 80 years or older (Awano et al. 2008). In a cohort of community-dwelling and well-functioning seniors, Jutbina-Mehta et al. identified mobility limitation and oral plaque burden as modifiable risk factors for pneumonia requiring hospitalization ( Juthani-Mehta et al. 2013). Our results corroborated these studies by demonstrating an epidemiological link between denture wearing during sleep and serious pneumonia, which suggests potential implications of oral hygiene programs for the prevention of community-acquired pneumonia in the very elderly.Elucidating the biological mechanisms by which denture wearing during sleep raises the risk of serious pneumonia is likely to provide rational information to design effective and convincing oral health programs for the very elderly, who have an increased need for removable prostheses and show loss of immune competence. First, even in a healthy older adult, aspiration of unnoticed oropharyngeal and periodontal secretions occurs during sleep, and a high incidence of silent aspiration is strongly related to pneumonia among the elderly (Kikuchi et al. 1994), particularly those with dementia or cerebrovascular disease. Denture wearing during sleep was reported to be associated with poor denture hygiene, oral candidiasis (Compagnoni et al. 2007), and denture stomatitis (Baran and Nalçaci 2009; Fenlon et al. 1998; Shulman et al. 2005; Vigild 1987), all of which may function as reservoirs of potentially infectious pathogens (Sumi et al. 2010). Our findings that denture wearers during sleep had significantly higher rates of denture and tongue plaque and oral candidiasis provide additional evidence for this suggestion. The secretion and function of saliva might have substantial influences on the relationship between denture wearing during sleep and Candida Infection. Previous studies speculated that nocturnal denture wearing decreases the protective effects of saliva against Candida spp. (Compagnoni et al. 2007; Ikebe et al. 2006). Although Candida Spp. infrequently cause pneumonia, they are an important risk factor for denture stomatitis (Pires et al. 2002), which is characterized as inflammation and erythema of the oral mucosa and its predisposal to bacterial pathogens. Therefore, the protective effect of saliva is an important factor of denture stomatitis as well as aspiration pneumonia, and it would be wise to look into patients’ nocturnal denture-wearing habits and relations with oral immunity, or their salivary defense proteins such as immunoglobulin A. Second, denture wearing during sleep may be an indicator of overall poor oral hygiene practices. In the present study, denture wearers during sleep were characterized by lower frequencies of dental visits and denture cleaning, and extremely limited usage of denture cleansers compared to their counterparts. In this scenario, it remains unclear whether the physical removal of dentures during sleep is sufficiently efficient to reduce the risk of pneumonia, or if assiduous hygiene practices have preventive effects. Because of the observational nature of this study, we did not address this issue. Recently, a randomized clinical trial of institutionalized subjects demonstrated that overnight storage of dentures with alkaline peroxide-based tablets significantly decreased denture biofilm and the amount of C. albicans to a greater extent than dry or water preservation (Duyck et al. 2013). There is a great deal of evidence supporting the effect of biofilm removal using a denture cleanser (Silva-Lovato et al. 2010); however, few studies have reported its practical usage, such as the dipping time ( Jose et al. 2010). Future prospective and interventional studies are warranted to examine whether appropriate use of cleansers or other methods (e.g., microwave cleaning) in combination with overnight denture removal could further reduce the risk of pneumonia in the elderly.Based on evidence supporting a mechanistic link between continuous denture wearing and Candida-related stomatitis, guidelines and dental professionals have recommended the overnight removal of dentures for many years. Nevertheless, a surprisingly high percentage of senior denture users do not remove their dentures during the night, for example 41.5% of patients at a university clinic in Brazil (Takamiya et al. 2011), 55.2% of complete denture wearers aged 60 years or older in Turkey (Baran and Nalçaci 2009), and 24.2% of edentulous elderly in a longitudinal cohort study in Canada (Emami et al. 2013). Therefore, to change denture wearers’ behavior, exploration of contributing factors to the disparity between knowledge and behavior may be an effective approach. From a psychosocial viewpoint, the reasons for denture wearing during sleep may be multifactorial and vary according to age, sex, and cultural background. A study in Brazil suggested that the presence of a partner could be a reason for denture wearing during sleep (Takamiya et al. 2011); however, this may not have been the case for our participants, because those who lived alone exhibited a comparably high percentage of overnight denture wearing. Another reason the elderly do not remove their dentures at night is that the remaining teeth and denture precision attachment might hit the contralateral residual ridge in participants without opposing tooth occlusion (e.g., Eichner classifications C1 and C2). Such elders might wear dentures to avoid sharp pain. In fact, we found that the incidence of Eichner classification C tended to be higher in nocturnal denture wearers than in non wearers (wearers, 80.7%; non wearers, 73.9%; P = 0.109), which partially supports this notion.In contrast to previous studies, neither educational achievement nor economic status was associated with denture-wearing habits in the present study. A possible alternative is fear of denture loss in the case of an unexpected event. During the Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake in 1995, denture loss was a serious problem encountered by many elderly disaster victims (Hyogo Dental Association 1996). In an earthquake-prone country such as Japan, innovation of emergency interim denture technology (Kurozumi et al. 2010) and dissemination of survival manuals with appropriate information on denture storage could be effective approaches to encourage the removal of dentures during sleep at night.Our study had several limitations. First, pneumonia in the elderly can occasionally be underdiagnosed due to its atypical presentation. In this study, we relied on death or acute hospitalization from pneumonia only, which may have resulted in underestimation of the incidence of pneumonia. We expect this effect to be approximately similar across oral health status, however, and not to affect comparisons between denture-wearing categories. Second, our sample size was relatively small, and it was limited to seniors living in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Dental resources and delivery systems vary among countries and localities. Therefore, our findings must be validated in a larger scale, separate cohort study. Third, our sample solely comprised very old individuals, who more frequently present with physical and cognitive disabilities and have a higher rate of mortality from pneumonia than younger elders. Therefore, it might be difficult to generalize our findings to younger populations. In addition, we did not examine denture stomatitis precisely using measures such as the Newton scale in this study. A further study is warranted because the state of denture stomatitis could represent a mechanistic link between denture-wearing habits and the risk of pneumonia.In conclusion, the present study provided empirical evidence that denture wearing during sleep is associated not only with oral inflammatory and microbial burden but also with incident pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening condition in the very elderly. These results suggest that simple denture care habits could reduce the risk of pneumonia in the community. To meet the widespread need for dental prostheses among the very elderly in both developed and developing countries, evidence-based guidelines (Felton et al. 2011) as well as oral health promotion programs with appropriate denture care should be urgently disseminated to dental professionals, primary care providers, and community services.Author Contributions.

A Systematic Review of the Preventive Effect of Oral Hygiene on Pneumonia and Respiratory Tract Infection in Elderly People in Hospitals and Nursing Homes: Effect Estimates and Methodological Quality of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Petteri Sjo ̈gren, DDS, PhD, Erika Nilsson, DHl Marianne Forsell, DDS,wOlle Johansson, PhD,zand Janet Hoogstraate, PhD§","The objective of this study was to investigate the preventive effect of oral hygiene on pneumonia and respiratory tract infection, focusing on elderly people in hospitals and nursing homes, by systematically reviewing effect estimates and methodological quality of randomized controlled trials(RCTs) and to provide an overview of additional clinical studies in this area. Literature searches were conducted in the Medline database, the Cochrane library databases, and by hand-searching reference lists. Included publications were analyzed for intervention (or topic) studied, main conclusions, strength of evidence, and study design. RCTs were further analyzed for effect magnitudes and methodological details. Absolute risk reductions (ARRs) and numbers needed to treat (NNTs) were calculated. Fifteen Publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was a wide variation in the design and quality of the studies included. The RCTs revealed positive preventive effects of oral hygiene on pneumonia and respiratory tract infection in hospitalized elderly people and elderly nursing home residents, with ARRs from 6.6% to 11.7% and NITs from 8.6 to 15.3 individuals. The non-RCT studies contributed to inconclusive evidence on the association and correlation between oral hygiene and pneumonia or respiratory tract infection in elderly people. Mechanical oral hygiene has a preventive effect on mortality from pneumonia, and non-fatal pneumonia in hospitalized elderly people and elderly nursing home residents. Approximately one in 10 cases of death from pneumonia in elderly nursing home residents may be prevented by improving oral hygiene. Future research in this area should be focused on high-quality RCTs with appropriate sample size calculations.J Am Geriatr Soc 56:2124–2130, 2008.Key words: dentistry; elderly; nursing home; pneumonia;randomized controlled trial","Health-care associated (hospital-acquired, or nosocomial) pneumonia occurs in patients in intensive care units and institutionalized individuals, such as nursing home residents.Pneumonia is a common infection in elderly people and the most common cause of mortality from nosocomial infection in elderly patients, with a mortality rate of up to 25%.1,2 Bacterial species that normally do not colonize the oropharynx frequently cause health care–associated pneumonia, and the oral cavity has been suggested as an important reservoir for these respiratory pathogens.Elderly patients in nursing homes often have poor oral health due to difficulties in maintaining a sufficient level of personal oral hygiene and difficulties in accessing professional dental care.Hence, a relationship between poor oral hygiene and bacterial pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infections has been suggested in the literature.4–6A plausible mechanism of healthcare–associated pneumonia could be aspiration of oral pathogens into the lungs.Clinical trials have sought to determine whether oral care reduces the incidence of pneumonia, respiratory tract infections, and mortality in pneumonia in elderly people, and a relatively recent systematic review concluded that better oral hygiene and frequent professional oral care reduce the progression or occurrence of respiratory tract dis-eases in high-risk elderly people living in nursing homes and intensive care units.This study was initiated to further elucidate and systematically summarize the effect estimates and the methodological quality of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) linking oral hygiene status to pneumonia and respiratory tract infections in elderly people and to provide an overview of additional clinical studies in this area. METHODS Literature SearchesLiterature searches were conducted in the MEDLINE da-tabase (April 2007–November 2007), focusing on combi-nations of search terms: ‘‘dental health’’[All Fields], ‘‘musclestrength’’[All Fields], ‘‘respiratory capacity’’[All Fields],‘‘survival’’[All Fields], ‘‘pneumonia’’[All Fields], ‘‘all causemortality’’[All Fields], ‘‘periodontitis’’[All Fields], and ‘‘pe-riodontium’’[All Fields]). Additional literature searcheswere conducted in the Cochrane Central Register of Con-trolled Trials and the National Health Service EconomicEvaluation Database (November 2007) using the MedicalSubject Headings descriptor ‘‘Dental Care for Aged,’’searchfunction: ‘‘explode all trees.’’ A list of names of known au-thors in this research area was also used in the searches(kindly provided by Dr. P. Ha ̈ma ̈la ̈inen, Jyva ̈skyla ̈Univer-sity, Jyva ̈skyla ̈, Finland). The literature searches were lim-ited to publication years 1996 to 2007 and to studiesconducted in humans only. Additional studies were locatedby scrutinizing the reference lists of obtained publicationsand the doctoral thesis by Ha ̈ma ̈la ̈inen.9The predeterminedinclusion criteria were clinical studies, focusing on RCTs,linking oral hygiene to health care–associated pneumoniaor respiratory tract infection in elderly people (65, al-though not an absolute limit). Publications in Dutch, En-glish, German, and any of the Nordic languages (Danish,Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish) were included.Publications about authority opinions and reports of expertcommittees were excluded, as were studies on subjects withmechanical ventilation or tube feeding. After the literature searches were completed, no additional publications were included.Strength of Evidence All publications were scrutinized for study design and ordered according to the hierarchical strength of evidence,from the strongest level (type-1 evidence) to the weakest(type-5) evidence, in accordance with the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM).10 Systematic reviews of RCTs were considered to be type-1 evidence; RCTs, type-2; and studies with a nonrandomized design, type-3. Type-4 evidence, as presented previously,10 was not used in this study, because it is intended for well-designed non randomized studies from different research groups on a specific topic. Thus, all nonrandomized studies were grouped together on the type-3 level, with the exception of descriptive studies that were assigned the lowest (type-5) level of evidence.10 Methodological Assessments All studies fulfilling the predetermined inclusion criteria were scrutinized for country of origin, intervention (ortopic) studied, journal of publication, main conclusions,publication year, strength of evidence, and study design.The quality of RCTs was assessed using a validated scale that includes three items directly related to the validity of an RCT, described in detail elsewhere.11 Briefly, the adequacy of reporting random allocation, double-blinding, and withdrawals and dropouts were rated, giving a total score of 0 to 5 points (0–2 points 5 poorer quality, 3–5 points 5 higher quality).11Also, for RCTs a definition of pneumonia or respiratory tract infection, as well as the presence of a power calculation were assessed. Although, one of the au-thors (PS) was experienced in conducting quality assess-ments of RCTs, two of the authors (EN, PS) completed allassessments.Data Extraction and AnalysesData extraction from RCTs was focused on the outcomefrequency in the control group (control event rate, CER%)and in the experiment group (experiment event rate,EER%)1and sample size in the control group and in thetest group(s). For parallel group RCTs, the frequency ofpneumonia, or lower respiratory tract infection, in the con-trol group (CER%) and in the experiment group (EER%),were used to calculate the absolute risk reductions (ARRs;ARR5CER%EER%), and numbers needed to treat(NNTs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals(CIs) using standard formulas (95% CI5ARR1.96standard error).12,13The NNT values (95% CIs for NNTs)were obtained as reciprocals of ARR (NNT5100/ARR), aspreviously described.12To ensure the consistency of theassessments throughout the study, two authors (EN, PS)performed the data extraction independently, and anydisagreements were solved in consensus meetings. Poolingdata from individual studies (meta-analysis) was notdeemed suitable because of heterogeneous study designs,quality of reporting methodological aspects, and trialconduct.To provide an overview of additional clinical studies inthis research area, the non-RCT studies that were identifiedin the literature were scrutinized for the authors’ main con-clusion(s).RESULTSLiterature SearchesThe Medline literature searches resulted in 191 eligiblepublications that were scrutinized for predetermined inclu-sion and exclusion criteria of this study. In addition, 137studies were identified by hand-searching reference lists ofthe publications obtained. Fifteen publications fulfilled theinclusion criteria and remained throughout the assessments(Table 1). The studies included were published during 1996 to 2006, in 10 scientific journals and originated from six countries (Table 1).Methodological Assessments of RCTs In systematic review (type-1 evidence) and five RCT publications (type-2 evidence) were identified (Table 1), al-though two of the RCT reports covered the same trial (i.e.,duplicate publication) (Table 1). Methodological quality assessment of the RCTs revealed that one of the RCTs contained an appropriate methodology of double-blinding, and an adequate method of random allocation was given in three RCT publications (Table 2). Moreover, three of five RCT reports gave a complete reporting of withdrawals and dropouts (Table 2). High-quality scores (3 to 5 points on the Jadad scale) were assigned for three RCT reports(Table 2). A power calculation was not reported in any of the RCTs, whereas a definition of the studied endpoint (pneumonia or respiratory tract infection) was given in four of five trial reports (Table 2). In total, three of the RCTs (one duplicate publication) were parallel group trials, and one had a crossover design (Table 2).Effect Estimates in RCTs In the parallel-group RCT publications (n54), two of which covered the same trial (i.e., duplicate publications),sufficient primary data were given for secondary analyses.Four different endpoints were analyzed (Table 3). All of these RCTs revealed positive preventive effects of oral care pneumonia or respiratory tract infection in nursing home residents 15,19,23,24or hospitalized elderly patients.14The ARRs ranged from 6.6% to 11.7%, and the ESTranged from 8.6 to 15.3 individuals (Table 3). One of the RCTs studying the preventive effect for death from pneumonia on nursing home residents, with tooth brushing after every meal, alone or in combination with daily 1% povidone iodine scrubbing of the pharynx, had 95% CIs for ARR and NNT values that were solely positive, indicating strong evidence of a clinically relevant effect (Table 3).Moreover, data from one RCT indicated that preoperative 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse may reduce the incidence of respiratory tract infection in hospitalized elderly patients undergoing heart surgery (Table 3).Non-RCT Publications majority of the studies had a non-RCT study design(n510), contributing to type-3 level of evidence (Table 1).These studies were of heterogeneous designs and studied various aspects regarding the association and correlation between oral hygiene or oral microflora and pneumonia or respiratory tract infection (Table 1). Nevertheless, the main conclusions from non-RCT clinical studies are similar to those from the RCTs and indicate a correlation between poor oral hygiene or deficient denture hygiene and pneumonia or respiratory tract infection in dependent or frail elderly people (Table 4).DISCUSSION The aim of this study was to investigate the preventive effect of oral hygiene on health care–associated pneumonia and respiratory tract infection in elderly people by systematically summarizing the scientific evidence derived from RCTs and to provide an overview of additional clinical studies on this subject, published during the last decade. Tolocate as many relevant publications as possible, a database literature search strategy with low specificity was chosen.The MEDLINE and Cochrane library databases were searched for clinical studies, focusing on RCTs, of the effects of oral hygiene on pneumonia and respiratory tract infections in elderly people. Additional studies were located by scrutinizing the reference lists of the obtained publica-tions, although because the chosen database search filters did not automatically include relevant publications about general effects of oral hygiene on pneumonia or respiratory tract infection, it is possible that some relevant studies may have been falsely excluded from the literature searches.27 Moreover, no attempts were made to locate unpublished studies, but to reduce the extent of language bias, RCTs written in eight different languages were allowed for inclusion. Despite the limitations of the current literature search strategy, the included sample is highly representative, containing a majority of the published RCTs available about the preventive effect of oral hygiene on pneumonia and respiratory tract infections in elderly people. Data from the included RCTs were not considered a suitable meta-analytical approach because of the heterogeneity in primary endpoints, methodological quality, study conducts, andstudy design. Therefore, the RCTs were analyzed separately. The included RCTs were also heterogeneous in the study populations, with four of the located RCTs conducted in nursing homes 15,19,23,24 and one in a hospital.14The quality of the included trials was assessed using the Jadad scale, a validated 5-point quality scale that includes three items to assess the methodology used for random allocation, double-blinding, and a description of withdrawals and dropouts for each intervention or control group.11Th Jadad scale has been widely used in medical and dental research and has been shown to incorporate components that are directly related to the control of bias.11,28,29 If an intervention is intended for clinical use, it is important to use clinically relevant outcome measures to monitor the effect magnitude.12 Therefore, it was decided to present the preventive effects of different interventions with ARTs and NNTs, as recommended in evidence-based medicine.12 ARR describes the absolute reduction in the event rate (e.g., frequency of pneumonia), whereas theNNT values give the number of patients needed to treat with the studied intervention to prevent one outcome of interest (e.g., pneumonia) during the follow-up period.12 Of the RCTs on prevention of pneumonia or respiratory tract infection in elderly people with oral hygiene interventions, the most convincing effects were seen for weekly provided professional oral care and for tooth brushing after every meal (in combination with 1% povidone iodine scrubbing of pharynx when necessary). These RCTs showed CARs between 7% and 12%, and the highest N value was 14 individuals.19,23,24 Moreover, in one RCT,solely positive 95% CIs strengthened the evidence of the preventive effect.23 One additional RCT studied the effect of preoperative 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse for prevention of nosocomial respiratory tract infection in patients undergoing heart surgery.12th RCT revealed an overall positive effect, with a NNT of approximately 15 individuals and solely positive CIs.12 Curiously, in the same trial, although beyond the scope of this study, a reduction in mortality after surgery was also seen in the chlorhexidine group.12 How-ever, these are data from one RCT, and additional trials from independent research groups would be necessary to confirm the findings.The findings of the current study are largely consistent with a previous systematic review that concluded that there is good evidence that oral care reduces the progression or occurrence of respiratory diseases in high-risk elderly people living in nursing homes and intensive care units.Moreover, the current study demonstrates that conclusive data are available from RCTs of a clinically relevant preventive effect of oral care on mortality from pneumonia and pneumonia as such.Some variation was seen in the quality of reporting threaTs, and the Jadad quality scores varied from 1 to 4 points. In general, trials with 0 to 2 points are considered to be of poorer quality, and trials with 3 to 5 points are considered to be of higher quality.11 Because the only information that a reader can obtain about the trial conduct is from its written report, it is possible that the trial conduct has not been thoroughly described in the actual trial report.11,26 This is evident in the current study, in which differences in the two RCT reports covering the same trial were found.19,23 Therefore, recommendations for reporting parallel-group randomized trials (e.g., the Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials statement) should be followed.30 Beyond the random allocation process, methodology of double-blinding, and reporting of withdrawals and dropouts, a high-quality RCT needs to fulfill a number of methodological requirements to eliminate the risk of incorporation of bias into the trial results.11 For example, in the context of power calculation, the primary statistical end-points need to be predefined and analyzed separately, or if combined endpoints are chosen, they must be compensated for in the statistical analyses and sample size calculations.31 Similarly, larger sample sizes are required for multicenter studies to compensate for cluster effects.32 For clinical application of trial reports, the trial had to have been conducted in a homogeneous study population similar to the population in which the trial results are intended for in clinical practice.12As for the trials included in the current study, it is important to keep in mind that three of the trials were conducted in nursing home,15,19,23,24 and one RCT in a hospital;14th us, the trial results may only be applicable in these selected populations.Statisticians have expressed a serious concern regarding underpowered trials, because a trial with inadequate statistical power may falsely reject a true effect of an intervention.33It was somewhat troubling to find that none of the RCTs included reported a sample size or power calculation. Hence, insufficient sample size may have caused theCIs to cross 0 in some of these trials.30 Therefore, it is important to remember that absence of statistical significance is not evidence of absence of a difference between the studied groups.33 Although the results presented in the RCTs included point to the same direction, the methodological compromises in the RCTs included raise a concern as to whether the association between the improvement in oral hygiene and reduction in pneumonia or respiratory tract infections may be associated with an unknown risk factor.Further clinical research in this area should focus on adequately powered, preferably double-blinded, RCTs, studying the preventive effect of different oral hygiene regimen on pneumonia and respiratory tract infections.A number of non-RCT studies with cross-sectional and longitudinal design were also located in the literature searches. These studies mainly provided microbiological associations between health care–associated pneumonia and respiratory tract infection, in addition to data on the incidence of and the association between oral hygiene and pneumonia or respiratory tract infection. The strength of evidence from these studies was moderate to weak (type-3)and inconclusive, although data from these non-RCT studies aid in understanding how oral care is handled and how it can affect health status and may therefore prove useful for etiological discussions or hypothesis generation for futureresearch.It was beyond the scope of this study to analyze magnitudes of different risk factors for pneumonia or respiratory tract infection (e.g., smoking, other diseases), all of which should be balanced in an adequately allocated RCT but should be reviewed from a sample of case-control studies. Although this systematic review was focused on RCTs,rigorously conducted observational studies have been shown to be powerful in identifying unbiased risk estimates for different outcomes.34 Nevertheless, in evidence-based medicine, the RCT is considered a criterion standard for studying preventive and therapeutic interventions, and systematic reviews of RCTs are considered the highest level of evidence.10The present study was not intended as a clinical guideline but as a systematic review of the current evidence from RCTs and as an overview of clinical studies in this area.Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that available results from RCTs provide strong evidence that mechanical oral hygiene decreases mortality risk from pneumonia and seems to have a clinically relevant preventive effect on nonfatal pneumonia in dependent elderly individuals. These data show that providing mechanical oral hygiene may prevent approximately one in 10 cases of death from pneumonia in dependent elderly people and indicate a largely similar effect for prevention of pneumonia.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Conflict of Interest:Petteri Sjo ̈gren and Erika Nilsson are employees of Oral Care AB.

Association of edentulousness with systemic factors in elderly people living at home,Qiufei Xie and Anja Ainamo,"Objective:To examine the association of edentulousness with systemic factors: age, gender, tobacco-smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, functioning in daily living, cortical thickness at the mandibular angle, and systemic diseases:bone-fracture (an indicator for osteoporosis), diabetes, thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism, asthma, heart failure, hypertension.Methods:The study population comprised 293 elderly subjects, 124 (42%) edentulous and 169 (58%) dentate. The Data from clinical and radiographic examinations and structured interviews were analyzed by multiple logistic regression.Results:When edentulousness in both the mandible and the maxilla was considered, history of bone fracture and tobacco-smoking were significantly related to complete edentulousness with odds ratios(OR) of 2.51 (95% CI: 1.47–4.28) and 2.42 (95% CI: 1.32–4.43) respectively, associations independent of age and gender. A similar association was found for the edentulous mandible. In the elderly subjects with an edentulous maxilla, besides the significant factors of history of bone fracture and tobacco-smoking, asthma was also associated with edentulousness at an odds ratio of 10.81 (95% CI: 1.38-84.66), Diabetes was not related to edentulousness either in the mandible or in the maxilla. Conclusion: The finding of associations of history of bone fracture, tobacco-smoking and asthma with edentulousness emphasizes the association of systemic conditions with edentulousness. Advanced age was related to an edentulous maxilla. The relationship between asthma and total tooth loss in the maxilla might suggest a local oral effect of medications used by asthmatic patients. Key words: advanced age; asthma; bone fracture; diabetes; edentulousness; smoking","Loss of teeth is mainly attributed to dental caries and periodontal diseases. Factors leading to tooth extraction are not, however, always dental origin. Edentulousness and a small number of remaining teeth are associated with low education level, low family income, and rural domicile (1–5).In some cases, people have preferred extractions to conservative treatment due to the long distance between home and dental services (3). The influence of these socio-economic and socio-demographic factors on edentulousness has been well documented (1–5).Dental caries and periodontitis are caused by microorganisms, but age, gender, oral hygiene, andlifestyle (dietary habits, tobacco-smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity) (5–11), as well as certain systemic diseases (osteoporosis, diabetes) (12, 13),may modify the progression of these disorders.Prevalence of edentulousness increases with age and is higher in women than in men (4, 14). Tobacco-smoking is often related to poor oral hygiene (6,8, 11, 15), periodontitis (8, 10), and caries (8, 10), as well as to bone mineral loss (16, 17). An association has been reported between alcohol consumption and periodontitis (5) and edentulousness (7).Edentulousness and number of missing teeth are greater in patients suffering from systemic osteoporosis than in subjects without this condition (12).Postmenopausal women, elderly men, and subjects with certain systemic conditions (hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, diabetes) and using certain medications (corticosteroids, thyroxine, a loop diuretic) are at risk of osteoporosis (18–22). Leanness Is also a risk factor for osteoporosis (20, 23). Higher Rates of caries and periodontal problems have been found in diabetics than in the general population(13, 24).Although the prevalence of edentulousness and the frequency of missing teeth have markedly decreased in developed countries during the last decades (14, 25–27), total tooth loss is still a major problem in people aged 65 or older, and the condition needs to be minimized.The present study was designed to examine elderly people living at home in Helsinki to determine the association of edentulousness with age,gender, tobacco-smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, functioning in daily living, cortical thickness at the mandibular angle, and systemic diseases such as bone fracture (an indicator for osteoporosis), diabetes, thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism, asthma, heart failure, and hypertension.Materials and methods Population The subjects studied came from a random sample(nΩ900) of a medical survey on 75-, 80-, and 85-year-old residents of Helsinki (Helsinki Aging Study [HAS]) (28, 29). A total of 600 individuals participated in this comprehensive medical study in 1989–1990 and were then invited to participate in a dental examination. Altogether, 364 subjects participated in the dental survey conducted in 1990 and 1991. Of these, 294 elderly people living at home attended the dental clinic of the Institute of Dentistry, University of Helsinki, and had a questionnaire interview and an oral examination by calibrated dentists, as well as a radiographic examination. A total of 293 elderly (85 men and 208 women) completing both oral and radiographic examinations were included in the present study. Of Them, 124 were edentulous in both jaws and 169 dentate in both jaws or in one jaw (55 had an edentulous maxilla, six an edentulous mandible). Panoramic radiographs were taken with PM 2002 CC panoramic apparatus (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland). This survey was approved by the Ethics Committees of the Central Hospital and the Institute of Dentistry of the University of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects participating the study.203 Data collection Data on the subjects’ general condition, such as weight, height, alcohol intake, and functioning in daily living, as well as systemic disorders: history of bone fracture, thyroid disease, diabetes, hyperparathyroidism, heart failure, hypertension, andasthma, were obtained from the records of the medical examination of HAS, in which the elderly underwent a structured interview by public health nurses and a clinical examination by physicians (30). In this population study no radiographic methods were used to diagnose osteoporosis, but history of skeletal bone fracture was interpreted as a positive sign of osteoporosis. Information on tobacco-smoking was obtained from the records of the dental survey, but some data for a few subjects on their general condition or their smoking were missing. Cortical thickness at the mandibular angle was assessed on both sides of the mandible, from subjects’ panoramic radiographs by one examiner (QX) (31). Ten percent of radiographs were randomly selected, re-markedand re-measured at an interval of 1 month to test intra-examiner error.The variables used in the present study were as follows:1. Age: 76, 81, and 86 year 2. Gender: 0Ωmale, 1Ωfemale3. Body Mass Index (BMIΩweight/height2), in kg/m24. Alcohol intake: 0Ωnone or less than once/week,1Ωonce/week or more5. Tobacco-smoking: 0Ωno, 1Ωyes (current smoker former smoker)6. Functioning in daily living: 0Ωindependent(does not need any help in housework), 1Ωde-pendent (needs help in housework or needs help both in housework and in other activities of daily living)7. Cortical thickness at the mandibular angle: 0ΩØ1 mm, 1Ω∞1mm8. Diseases caused by a disorder of bone metabolism or resulting in a disorder of bone metabolism, or diseases where the medications used for treatment influence bone metabolism: bone fracture,diabetes,thyroid disease,hyperparathyroidism, asthma, heart failure, hypertension: 0Ωno, 1Ωyes (each disorder recorded separately)9. Dental status: 0Ωdentate (having one tooth or more), 1Ωedentulous (no clinically visible tooth and/or retained root). StatisticAl analyses were made by SPSS/PCπAdvancedStatistics (version 5.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL). The chi-square test was used to compare frequencies of two or more groups of categorical variables. Multiple Logistic regression was performed to examine the associations between dental status and systemic variables with adjustment of age and gender. The Analyses were performed separately with the dependent variable being complete edentulousness(edentulous in both jaws), an edentulous mandible or an edentulous maxilla. In the statistical evaluation of the estimated regression coefficients, the Wald statistic (chi-square) was applied in the logistic regression analysis.Results Complete edentulousness was more common in the 81- and 86-year-olds and in all the women than in the 76-year-olds and men, but this difference was significant only for the 86-year-olds (Table 1).Adjusted for age and gender, tobacco-smoking was significantly related to complete edentulous-ness, with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.42 (95% CI: 1.32–4.43) and the crude OR was not related. In these 76-, 81-, and 86-year-olds bone fracture did not relate to their ages, but was more prevalent in the edentulous elderly than in the dentate elderly (crude OR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.51–4.34; age- and gender-adjusted OR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.47–4.28) (Table 1).No significant relationship appeared between the other variables studied and complete edentulous-ness.Similarly, in the edentulous mandible, tobacco-smoking and bone fracture adjusted for age and gender were also significantly associated with total tooth loss (Table 2), but the stronger risk factor was one fracture.In the edentulous maxilla, besides bone fracture and tobacco-smoking adjusted for age and gender,asthma was a risk factor for total tooth loss, with acrude OR of 10.52 (95% CI: 1.37–80.79) and an age-and gender-adjusted OR of 10.81 (95% CI: 1.38-84.66). Compared with the 76-year-olds, the 86-year-olds were about twice as likely to suffer total tooth loss (Table 2).When several significant risk factors were present together, the risk for edentulousness was increased for smoking and slightly decreased for bone fracture (Table 3). In the edentulous maxilla,asthma was not a statistically significant factor (PΩ0.052) when risk factors of bone fracture and smoking were present.The average body mass index was 25.7 kg/m2(SDΩ4.0), with no significant difference between men (meanΩ25.7, SDΩ3.5) and women (meanΩ25.7, SDΩ4.2). The mean of difference in re-measurements of cortical thickness was 0.03 mm (SDΩ0.27), not statistically significant.Discussion Association of advanced age and smoking with edentulousness is in agreement with earlier findings (25, 32–35). Although the number of remaining teeth has been suggested as useful to assess the possibility of osteoporosis in elderly women (36), few studies have as yet related skeletal bone fracture to edentulousness in both elderly men and women; in addition this seems to be the first report of a relationship between edentulous-ness and asthma.In Tables 1 and 2, tobacco-smoking and bone fracture emerged as risk factors for complete edentulousness as well as for the edentulous maxilla or the edentulous mandible. The odds ratios became smaller for the edentulous maxilla than for complete edentulousness, and the factors of age and asthma were significantly related to the edentulous maxilla, perhaps due to the relatively larger sample of edentulous maxilla than of complete edentulousness. In Table 3, when risk factors of bone fracture and smoking were present asthma was not statistically significant factor (PΩ0.052) for the edentulous maxilla. The reason may be that one subject was not included due to missing data.It is estimated that 26% of white women experience a bone fracture by age 60 and 50% by 75 years of age (18). This generalized osteoporosis-related reduction in bone mass may also involve the mandible(37–42), leading to low bone mass and density in the mandible (40, 43) or decreasing height of the alveolar bone in subjects without active periodontal disease (39). Among subjects suffering from advanced periodontal disease, patients with high mineral values in the skeleton retain their teeth more often than do those with osteoporosis (44).That a greater number of the edentulous than the dentate elderly in this study had a history of bone fracture may imply an effect of the skeletal disorder on tooth loss. Exact information was not available on the type of bone fracture experienced by these elderly subjects. Because of the high prevalence of osteoporotic bone fracture in the elderly and the history of bone-fracture recorded upto the greatest age, most occurrences of bone fracture in this study were considered to be associated with generalized bone mineral loss. Additionally,of the 124 completely edentulous subjects, only five had received their first denture because of tooth loss caused by trauma, and only one of the 55 with an edentulous maxilla.Tobacco-smoking is deleterious to periodontal health (5, 8, 9, 17). When compared with subjects without a smoking habit, smokers also tend to have other negative health behaviors such as apoorer standard of oral hygiene and less thorough tooth brushing practices, and are more likely to choose extraction as an acceptable dental treatment(8, 15, 45). They also show more accumulation of plaque and calculus on tooth surfaces. Among patients with periodontal disease, smokers outnumber non-smokers and have more periodontally affected teeth and sites (9). Female smokers have a lower number of remaining teeth and are more often edentulous than female non-smokers (35).Furthermore, the study by Ismail et al. (6), with age, sex, oral hygiene, and toothbrushing con-trolled for, found an independent direct association between smoking and periodontal disease. Smoking has been recognized as a risk factor for bone mass loss and bone fracture, although the mechanisms by which smoking influences bone mass are still unknown (16, 20, 23). Smoking during early adulthood lessens the body’s achievement of peak bone mass and density, which contribute to bone strength; smoking in late adulthood probably results in early menopause, leading to accelerated bone loss (16, 46). Tobacco-smoking is also a risk factor for osteoporosis in men (47, 48). The present study found smoking, as a major risk factor for edentulousness, a factor independent of age and gender. The crude OR of tobacco-smoking did not reach the significant level of 5%. The proportion of smokers was greater among men and the proportion of edentulous smaller among men than among women (49).Corticosteroids reduce bone mineral density by 207 inhibiting calcium absorption in the intestine,increasing calcium and phosphate excretion in the urine, and causing secondary hyperparathyroidism (50). Patients treated with corticosteroids have shown up to 17% loss of trabecular bone per annum (51). Compared with non-steroid-treated asthmatic subjects a total of 11% have shown rib or vertebral fractures (52). In addition to the systemic influence of corticosteroids on bones, patients who have received inhaled corticosteroids probably experience a local effect; that bone cells have glucocorticoid receptors makes it possible that glucocorticoids act directly on osteoblasts and suppress bone formation (50). The immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are well recognized.Periodontitis Inflammatory Disease with bone involvement, and the effects of glucocorticosteroids are likely to influence the course of periodontal bone loss. Both the osteoporotic side-effects and the immunosuppressive and anti inflammatory effects may cause alveolar bone loss, aggravating subjects’ periodontal disease and finally resulting in tooth loss (53). A well-controlled longitudinal study on asthmatic patients is needed to investigate the local effect of corticosteroids on alveolar bone. In the present study, among the 15 asthmatic subjects with edentulous maxilla,eight received oral corticosteroids; six were not taking corticosteroids during the examination, and data for one subject on medications were missing.Because asthma can hardly be directly related to tooth loss in this group of elderly, use of corticosteroids may therefore be an explanation for the fact that more asthmatic subjects had lost their upper teeth than the other subjects. The prevalence of asthma has been increasing over the last 35 years(54). In light of the medications used to treat asthma, particular attention should be paid to the oral health of these patients.In the present study, tobacco-smoking and systemic disease were recorded merely as present or absent. Disease severity and duration, number of packs of cigarettes per day, and time association between tooth loss and disease diagnosis remained unknown, thus limiting further analysis and application of these results.The effect of alcohol intake on periodontal health and the relationship between number of remaining teeth and alcohol intake both seem to be influenced by among other factors (5, 7) level of consumption.In a study relating diet to number of remaining teeth, Halling et al. (7) reported edentulousness to be2.6 times as common in women who never drank wine as among women with an intake of wine at least occasionally. This finding was explained by the strong correlation between socioeconomic groups and dental status (55). In comparison with women of low socioeconomic status, women in the higher socio-economic groups had a higher intake of alcohol as well as better preserved dental status (7). This Lack of association between edentulousness and alcohol intake may thus be influenced by the participants’ socio-economic status. In the present study,risk factors for edentulousness were still significant when adjusted for education level. Effects of socio-economic factors (education, income, and area of residence) on edentulousness in these elderly will be reported in a separate article.Surprisingly, in the present study, diabetes showednoassociationwith edentulousness.Although periodontitis in diabetics is more prevalent and more severe than in non-diabetics (55), in well-controlled diabetics, it is, however, possible to reduce the risk of periodontitis by maintaining good oral hygiene (13, 56). Of the 42 diabetic subjects in the present study none had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (57). In our previous study (57) we compared 32 of these diabetics with healthy controls and there were no statistically significant differences in the oral health parameters of the subjects with NIDDM (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) or NIDDMπCVD (cardiovascular disease) compared with those of their age-and sex-matched healthy controls. It seems that subjects with IDDM and poorly controlled diabetes had not survived to advanced age. Whether there is osteopathy caused by diabetes is still unclear. Epidemiological studies involving diabetics show different results; lower bone mineral density (BMD),unchanged BMD, or even increased BMD (58).Osteoporosis can be a secondary consequence of prolonged immobilization(20).The Subjects Studied were ambulatory elderly people able to attend the clinical examination themselves or accompanied by their relatives. Only three of the elderly people needed help with activities in daily living.Not surprisingly, no difference in the prevalence of edentulousness was found, in the present study,between functionally independent elderly and those who needed some kind of help in their dailyliving.In conclusion, in elderly people, history of bone fracture, tobacco-smoking, asthma, and advancedage were found to be related to edentulousness.These associations indicate the effect of systemic condition on edentulousness. However, in this 208 study on very old subjects diabetes did not have an association with edentulousness.Acknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge Professor Juhani Wolf,Institute of Dentistry, University of Helsinki, for helpful discussions during the preparation of this paper.
