Complete denture digital workflow: Combining basic principles with a CAD-CAM approach,"George Kouveliotis, DDS, MSc, Theodoros Tasopoulos, DDS, MSc, Ioannis Karoussis, DDS, MSc, Dr med dent, Nelson Rfa Silva, DDS, MSc, PhD, and Panagiotis Zoidis, DDS, MS, PhD","This report describes a digital workflow for the fabrication of a complete maxillary denture opposing an implant-retained overdenture. This procedure provides a predictable and accurate 3-visit technique to digitally scan and articulate edentulous ridges, avoiding the discomfort associated with analog impression making. Wax rims were applied to intraorally relined plastic edentulous stock trays. The occlusal relationship was registered at the appropriate vertical dimension of occlusion by using these tray and rim assemblies. The digital laboratory scanning of the relined tray and rim assemblies resulted in accurate virtual articulation of the digital edentulous intraoral scans. The removable restorations were digitally designed, milled, and delivered, and the clinical and laboratory steps are described. (J Prosthet Dent 2021;-:---)","Complete dentures have been the predominant treatment option for restoring complete edentulism, with different clinical approaches being proposed to restore function and provide natural esthetics. Information on detailed impression techniques or appropriate tooth positioning has been well established.1,2 Computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) systems provide advantages for complete denture fabrication,3 including avoiding the discomfort of conventional impression making, improving processing accuracy, and reducing laboratory and chair-side time.4-8 The use of intraoral scanners (IOSs) and laboratory scanners for fixed or implant-supported restorations has also been well documented.9 Intraoral digital scanning for edentulous patients has been problematic because of the lack of accuracy and difficulty in capturing viscoelastic soft tissues, although different approaches have been developed for complete denture digital scanning and manufacturing.10 Initial Comparison of conventional impression making with digital scanning revealed differences related to mucosa resilience.10 These results indicated that digital complete denture fabrication should follow a different workflow from the conventional one. The mucostatic concept should be followed during digital scanning, as it has been found to be more effective than the conventional one forthin or sharp mucosa biotype andflabby, movable tissue,resulting in fewer post treatment adjustments and increased patient satisfaction.11-17 TECHNIQUES completely digital protocol is described for the restoration of an edentulous maxilla opposing a mandibular overdenture retained by 2 implants (Fig. 1).1. Use an IOS (TRIOS 3; 3Shape A/S) to make digital scans of the edentulous arches. Send the standard tessellation language (STL)files to the laboratory through the appropriate server (3 Shape Community; 3Shape A/S) (Fig. 2).2. Choose the appropriate size of handle-free edentulous stock plastic trays (DENTALINE; Falcon) forboth ridges. Attach occlusal wax rims and perform an intraoral reline by using medium viscosity polyvinyl siloxane material (Rigidur i; Bielefelder Dentalsilicone GmbH & Co KG) to conform to arch form and provide retention and stability (Fig. 3).3. Make modifications to the wax rims according to the patient’s facial esthetics and lip support, facial midline, canine position, smile line, and occlusal plane (Fig. 4). 4. Adjust the wax rim height to an acceptable vertical dimension of occlusion. Make a centric relation recording the selected vertical dimension of occlusion (Fig. 5).5. Transfer the articulated relined tray and rim assemblies to a laboratory scanner (E3; 3Shape A/S) and digitize the registration to an STL file(Fig. 6).6. Superimpose the IOS STL files and the laboratory STL files (3 reference points on each STL file are needed) (Fig. 7) and allow for the simultaneous articulation of digital casts, digital base plates, andwax rims and digital records (Fig. 8).7. Digitally design denture bases for complete edentulous coverage with maximized retention and lip support. Digitally design tooth position and select artificial teeth from the available digital library(Dental System; 3Shape A/S) (Fig. 9).8. Send the resulting file to a 3D printer (Asiga MAX;Asiga) to produce a trial denture (FREEPRINT;DETAX GmbH & Co, KG) to imitate the conventional wax tooth clinical evaluation. Assess clinical parameters such as denture retention,flange extension, esthetics, phonetics, vertical dimension,maxillomandibular relation, and occlusion. Make Necessary adjustments at this stage (Fig. 10).9. Scan the adjusted prototypes with the same laboratory scanner. Send the new STL files to a milling machine (Ceramill Motion 2; Amann Girrbach AG)to fabricate the definitive dentures.10. Bond milled teeth (SR Vivodent CAD Multi; Ivoclar Vivadent AG) to the denture base with an auto-polymerizing polymethyl methacrylate-based 2-component bonding system, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (IvoBase CAD Bond;Ivoclar Vivadent AG).11. Polish and glaze the definite prostheses (Fig. 11).12. Incorporate the LOCATOR attachments (Xiv Locator Abutment; Dentsply Sirona) intraorally with an autopolymerizing polymethyl methacrylate resin(Lux Pick-up;DMG Chemisch-Pharmazeutische Fabrik GmbH) (Fig. 12).DISCUSSION The use of CAD-CAM technology in complete denturefabrication has helped dentists reduce the use of different materials, standardize clinical procedures, and save clinical time.6,7 Saponaro et al reported that the mean number of clinical appointments needed for CAD-CAM complete denture fabrication was 2.39, whereas with conventional workflow, at least 5 appointments are needed.8In the clinical technique presented, 3 clinical appointments were scheduled (digital scanning and records, printed clinical evaluation, and definitive prosthesis delivery). Retention was satisfactory, and no post insertion appointment was needed. Even though studies report that approximately 85% to 87% of patients require a post insertion adjustment within 24 hours when conventional protocols are used, minor or no adjustments were needed when the digital protocol was used.5The intraoral digital scanning of fully edentulous areas based on the mucostatic impression concept, with no pressure being applied to the recorded areas and no border molding. The limitation of not recording the vestibular depth and width is compensated for by this mucostatic digital scanning that results in maximizing the surface tension between the intaglio surface of the denture base and the underlying tissue.10,11 Digital mucostatic scans result in slightly underextended denture flanges, resulting in no trauma for overextension. Denture retention is not achieved by the peripheral seal, but mainly by the intimate contact of the surface of the denture base with the underlying tissues under the principle of surface tension.12 Slight under-extension of the flange does not affect denture retention,although excessive underextension is not desirable because it may reduce secondary retention and denture stability and impair lip and cheek support.13,14 Border Molding and palatal seal have been reported not to be required, and shorter denture flanges do not impact denture retention because of the intimate tissue contact.15 Esthetics and occlusion were assessed in the first visit(determined in the record base stage and followed through the intraoral registration stages). The reverse articulation design resulted from the configuration and shape of the mandibular arch resulting from the ridge resorption pattern and was used to enhance mandibular denture stability and retention and avoid cheek tissue injury during function. Esthetics and occlusion were confirmed in the second visit by using the denture prototype. Alterations and changes can still be performed on the trial denture and can be transferred to the definitive prosthesis. Bidra et al 16 evaluated edentulous patients treated with a digital workflow and reported favorable patient-centered outcomes at the 1-year evaluation for phonetics (93%), lip support (94.3%), masticatory efficiency (91.5%), esthetics (94.8%), and overall denture satisfaction (92.8%) according to a visual analog scale.A 2-visit technique has been proposed by Bidra17forthe fabrication of a CAD-CAM implant overlay denture,involving border molding, definitive impression making,intraoral registration, and occlusal plane recording with proprietary materials provided by the manufacturer(AvaDent Digital dentures; Global Dental Science LLC).An anatomic measuring device with a plastic pin on the palate and a central plate on the mandibular base (central bearings tracking device) was used to record the maxillomandibular relationship, and an occlusal plane reader was used to record the horizontal angulation of the occlusal plane. A laboratory scanner was used to digitize and articulate the definitive casts. The present digital technique does not require the use of proprietary materials or special devices and allows the clinician to follow conventional reline impression and registering methods.Limitations of the described technique include the extended clinical time of the first visit that included digital scanning, the intraoral reline procedure, the transformation of the stock trays into occlusion rims, andthe interocclusal registration procedure. In addition to laboratory scanner, an IOS is required. Moreover, any design software program and milling machine can be used with this digital technique.SUMMARYA 3-clinical appointment digital dental technique was described to fabricate complete dentures. This digital technique eliminated the need for expensive proprietary materials and devices and the uncomfortable conventional impression technique, facilitating and shortening dental treatment for completely edentulous patients.",-,"1.Lombardi R.

Nifedipine induced gingival enlargement in an edentulous patient: a case report with one year follow up,"Shaik Mohammed Asif, Naheeda Shaik, Bhavna Barthunia, Sultan Mohammed Kaleem, M Zakirullah, Mohammed Zahir Kota and Fawaz Abdul Hamid Baig","Background: Gingival enlargement due to calcium channel blockers is a common complaint reported by patients. It can be localized or generalized and can range from mild to severe, affecting patients appearance and function.Nifedipine induced gingival enlargement is noticed only in 10 % of patients and very few cases of Nifedipine induced gingival enlargement in an edentulous patient have been documented in the literature. Case presentation: Here in, we report a case of gingival enlargement in a 70 year old hypertensive edentulous patient who was on low dose Nifedipine therapy. Patient wanted complete dentures. We planned to excise the overgrowth and followed up for 1 year. Conclusion: Nifedipine induced gingival enlargement noticed only in 10 % of patients. Hence, there is a need for physicians and dentist to make a coordinated treatment plan and practice care while prescribing these drugs which are associated with gingival overgrowth. Keywords: Nifedipine induced, Edentulous patient, Gingival enlargement","Background Gingival hyperplasia is a multifactorial disease and drug induced gingival hyperplasia is an aesthetically disfiguring over growth attributable to various medications [1, 2]. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs for patients with cardiovascular disorders. Gingival hyperplasia on long term use of Nifedipine is rare in the literature [3]. The first documented case of Nifedipine induced gingival enlargement was reported in 1984 [4].Clinically-evident overgrowth of gingiva can be seen within 1–2 months after initiation of therapy. Incidence rate of nifedipine- induced gingival enlargement is 5–10% [5]. Various factors attribute for overgrowth of gingiva, which include poor oral hygiene,genetic factors, individual susceptibility, and interaction between drugs and its metabolites with fibroblast of gingiva [6]. Moreover age and gender have also been considered as risk factors for drug induced gingival enlargement [4, 7]. Nifedipine-induced gingival enlargement in an edentulous patient is rare in literature. Therefore,herein, we report a case of nifedipine-induced gingival enlargement in an edentulous patient.Case presentation 70-year old male patient reported to clinic with a chief complaint of swollen gums of 5 year duration and wanted to replace his missing teeth. Patient noticed swollen gums prior to his 4 years of edentulous state and the condition persisted to present. He was a known hypertensive and was on medication for the same since 7 years (10 mg Nifedipine/day).On intraoral examination- pink, firm, irregular, nodular, non- tender enlargements were found on labial aspects of maxillary and mandibular residual alveolar ridges. The enlargements were asymptomatic in nature with no history of bleeding.Both arches were completely edentulous (Fig.1). Panoramic radiograph showed no osseous deformities of maxilla and mandibular ridges (Fig.2). Patient’s complete blood count, bleeding time, clotting time and platelet count were within normal limits. An incisional biopsy was obtained from anterior right side of the maxilla.Histological report revealed hyperplastic and acantholytic stratified squamous epithelium with elongated rete ridges extending into connective tissue which was fibrocollagenous and showed focal areas of fibrosis. Infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells and congested blood vessels were seen which suggested of gingival hyperplasia (Fig.3).As patient wanted complete dentures, we planned to surgically excise entire overgrowth. Considering medical status of the patient, drug was not altered because, dose taken by the patient was low (10 mg/day). Local anesthesia devoid of vasoconstrictor was used to remove fibrous tissue from alveolar ridge with help of 15 no. B.P blade(Fig.4). To avoid any discomfort during the early phase of wound healing, a surgical splint was placed on both ridges after thoroughly covering the operated site with periodontal dressing (Coe Pack). The patient was recalled and followed at a period of 1 week, 3 months, 6 months and 1 Year intervals (Figs.5, 6, 7 and 8). No recurrence of growth was observed during any of the recall visits. After 3 months of surgery, patient had his complete denture fabrication. Even on further recall visits there was no recurrence of growth noticed.Discussion & conclusion Nifedipine is a very potent and effective antihypertensive drug. However, long term use of these anti-hypertensive drugs causes gingival enlargement. Ina community-based study, it was noticed that more than 6% of subjects taking Nifedipine had significant over-growth and it was directly proportional to amount of gingival inflammation [3]. As suggested by Seymour eaton [ 8] drug induced gingival hyperplasia is a multifactorial disease. Gingival enlargement in our case persisted even in edentulous state. It might be due to persistence of gingival overgrowth which did not resolve completely after extraction or might be due to incorporation of specific population of gingival fibroblast in alveolar ridge mucosa [9]. The other reason for gingival enlargement in edentulous state can be due to defective collagen activity or due to decreased uptake of folic acid, blockage of aldosterone synthesis from adrenal cortex and an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) cleveland up regulation of keratinocyte growth factor [10].Drugs like Nifedipine, block influx of calcium ions thereby affecting homeostasis of collagen. Synthesis and degradation of collagen being altered leads to the abnormal growth [11].Also a link to androgen metabolism has been suggested. Evidence from animal studies confirm that, nifedipine when added to gingival fibroblast in culture, increase the conversion of testosterone to 5αdi-dihydrotestosterone and this active metabolite would target subpopulations of fibroblasts [12, 13]. Idiopathic/Hereditary gingival enlargement from our case was ruled out as these enlargements are commonly detected at an early age and in few cases even at birth. Histological Findings of present case suggested drug induced gingival enlargement. Genetic factors like Polymorphism of enzymes that are involved in transport (P-glycoprotein MDR1, CYP2C) and metabolism (cytochrome P450) pharmacologically active substances have been investigated in various studies. A relationship has been described between gingival enlargement and the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA; HLA-DR2-positive patients) [14]. Other factors like heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HSPG), basic fibroblast growth factor(bFGF), and transforming growth factor–beta (TGF-β)were found to be high in drug induced gingival enlargement [10]. Dose of drug in present case was not altered as the dose was very low. Several studies in literature have suggested that a dose range of 30-60 mg/day is more associated with gingival enlargement [3]. Dose of Nifedipine taken by patient was below the threshold limit of gingival overgrowth. Relation between gingival hyperplasia and pharmacokinetics of the drug has been investigated and are much debatable. This threshold might differ from patient to patient which might not be suitable prognostic factors for gingival enlargement [8]. Normal ridges were noticed after surgical excision in our patient. There was no recurrence of growth on a year follow up and on regular use of denture by ourpatient.In conclusion, Nifedipine induced gingival enlargement is rare to occur in edentulous patients as there are no such reported cases from the past. The possible etiology for its occurrence is obsolete. Further studies are required to explain the association and existence of Nifedipine induced gingival enlargement in edentulous patients. Hence, there is a need for physicians and dentists to make a coordinated treatment plan and practice care while prescribing these drugs which are associated with gingival overgrowth.Abbreviations ACTH:Adrenocorticotropic hormone; bFGF: Basic fibroblast growth factor;CCBs: Calcium channel blockers; HSPG: Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan;TGF-β: Transforming growth factor–beta Acknowledgements None.Funding Non.Availability of data and materials All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.Authors’contributions MA performed the initial examination, patient assessment.

Simplified versus traditional techniques for complete denture fabrication: A systematic review,"Marcília R. Paulino, DDS, Luana R. Alves, DDS, Bruno C. V. Gurgel, PhD, Patrícia S. Calderon, PhDd","Statement of problem. A number of methods have been described for the fabrication of complete dentures. There are 2 common ways to make conventional complete dentures: a traditional method and a simplified method. Purpose.The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review to compare the efficiency of simplified and traditional methods for the fabrication of complete dentures. Material and methods.The review was conducted by 3 independent reviewers and included articles published up to December 2013. Three electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE-PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science. A manual search also was performed to identify clinical trials of simplified versus traditional fabrication of complete dentures. Results. Six articles were classified as randomized controlled clinical trials and were included in this review. The majority of the selected articles analyzed general satisfaction, denture stability, chewing ability and function, comfort, hygiene, esthetics, speech function, quality of life, cost, and fabrication time. Conclusions. Although the studies reviewed demonstrate some advantages of simplified over traditional prostheses, such as lower cost and clinical time, good chewing efficiency, and a positive effect on the quality of life, the reports related the use of different simplified methods for the fabrication of complete dentures. Additional randomized controlled trials that used similar simplified techniques for the fabrication of complete dentures should be performed with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods. (J Prosthet Dent 2015;113:12-16)","Complete edentulism is an important public health problem,especially among the elderly.1,2 The prevalence of total edentulism in seniors has been esti-matedtobe26%intheUnitedStates, 15% to 78% in Europe,24%in Indonesia,11%in China, and 23% in Brazil.3,4 Millions of individuals all over the world need removable complete dentures.5,6 Despite The existence of alternative techniques, such as implant-retained prostheses, the great majority of patients will continue to wear conventional dentures, particularly due to cost and the lack of access to care.1,6-8ths, society’s need for conventional complete dental prostheses will remain for the foreseeable future.1,6,7A number of methods have been described for the fabrication of complete dentures 3; two most common ways are the traditional method and the simplified method. The traditional method, which uses more complex and time-consuming techniques, is taught in most dental schools.9 Meanwhile, most general dentists treat patients who are edentulous with simplified techniques to reduce the number of visits and the time required to make the prostheses.1-3,6-8 Most assessments of the techniques have been through case reports or retrospective studies, which cannot provide high levels of evidence regarding the effect of a treatment. Questions regarding the efficacy or effectiveness of a treatment can be better answered by randomized trials and systematic reviews.1,Therefore, this systematic review aimed to investigate the efficiency of simplified methods for fabricating dentures compared with traditional methods. The traditional method for complete denture treatment includes the following clinical stages: anatomic and functional impression, Clinical Implications The results of this systematic review may guide opinions concerning treatment with complete dentures. The changes proposed to simplify the traditional technique can influence both teaching and dental practice in the field of complete dentures and provide complete dentures that are less costly and more efficient, without decreasing technical quality or patient satisfaction. the use of a semi-adjustable articulator with a facebow,wax evaluation, and occlusal adjustment in a semi-adjustable articulator. Any alternative method that eliminates any of the stages is called a simplified method, which means that the simplified method can vary among studies.MATERIAL AND METHODS Electronic searches of the MEDLINE-PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science databases were performed by 3 independent examiners (Paulino,MR;Alves,LR and Calderon,PS) to identify clinical trials of the simplified and traditional fabrication of complete dentures published in English, up to December 2013 by combining search terms given in Table 1. All identified abstracts were read to determine whether they met the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were human studies, randomized controlled clinical trial studies focused on comparing simplified methods and traditional method, and studies published in English. Exclusion Criteria were case reports, literature reviews, and the absence of statistical analysis (Table 2). All titles revealed by this strategy were screened, and an abstract search was done to find further relevant articles. Repeated articles were considered only once. The full-text articles then were obtained and reviewed if this determination could not be made only with abstracts. The electronic search was completed by hand searching the references of selected articles. Data were obtained from all selected articles and included the following parameters: authors of articles,study design, sample (number of participants, sex, andage), treatment groups, follow-up period, and results that concerned the differences between the methods.RESULTS The final electronic search of databases produced 277 records. 231=search through the electronic databases of descriptors; 7 = manual search of references from 18 articles.Subsequently, 19 full-text articles were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally 6 articles were selected. These 6 articles were derived from 3 studies according to the authors. Details about the search strategy are shown in Figure 1.Allselected Studies Included Randomized Controlled trials. However, no statistical analyses were performed because of differences in study methodologies among the reports. The major characteristics and results of each study are listed in Table 3.Six articles were included in the systematic review,however, they refer to 3 independent studies: study 1,Kawai et al6,7; study 2, Heydecke et al3; and study 3,Cunha et al1, Della Vecchia et al2, and Regis et al.8Thereby, in the selected studies, a total of 181 individuals ages 45 to 85 years were treated with complete dentures made by the traditional and simplified methods.Of these individuals, 101 were treated with the traditional method and 100 were treated with simplified methods. Only 1 study, Heydecke et al,3 treated 20 patients with both methods at different times (crossover).The main differences between the treatments included the functional impression method, the use or not of a facebow, type of articulator, and the remount. The Majority of the studies evaluated general satisfaction,denture stability, chewing ability and function, comfort, hygiene, esthetics, speech function, quality of life, cost of fabrication, and fabrication time.Kawai et al6,7 performed a randomized controlled clinical trial (n=122) to compare traditional and simplified methods of making complete conventional dentures. A100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate satisfaction, comfort, stability, esthetics, ability to speak,ease of cleaning, and mastication at 3 and 6 months after treatment.6 Denture quality was assessed by blinded professionals 6 months after treatment with a quantitative scale. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in participant ratings for overall satisfaction (3 months,P970; 6 months,P=.960) or in denture quality evaluation (P=.380). The direct costs of providing 1 set of complete dentures by the traditional or simplified methods were estimated. The clinician’s time was recorded for every procedure. The results showed that the mean total cost of the traditional method was significantly greater than for the simplified method (P<.001) and that clinicians spent 90 minutes longer for the traditional method (P<.001). The Investigators concluded that the simplified method was more cost efficient and that no negative consequences detracted from this cost saving.7 Heydecke et al conducted a randomized controlled crossover trial with 20 participants to compare a traditional technique (by using a facebow and lingualized teeth) with a simplified method that used anatomic teeth and canine guidance. Three months after treatment,participant ratings were obtained with a 100-mm VAS for general satisfaction, comfort, ability to speak, stability,esthetics, ease of cleaning, and ability to chew. At the end of the study (3 months after treatment with each method), all the participants were asked to compare the 2 methods. They rated their general satisfaction, stability,and esthetic appearance significantly higher for the simplified method (P<.05). No significant differences between the 2 denture methods were detected for the ability to speak, comfort, chewing ability, or the ease of cleaning.“The authors concluded that using lingualized teeth did not appear to positively influence patient satisfaction when compared with anatomic teeth.3”One study, which resulted in 3 articles, was conducted as a randomized controlled clinical trial 1,2,8 to compare the simplified methods for complete denture fabrication with the traditional method with regard to masticatory performance and ability 1; patients’oral health–related quality of life, satisfaction, and denture quality with the simplified method or the traditional method,8 and the costs of complete denture fabrication with the simplified and a traditional method.2 The OHIP-EDENT (Oral Health Impact Profile for edentulous patients) was used to assess oral health–related quality of life, and an inventory was used to assess satisfaction. The investigators concluded that the simplified method was able to produce dentures with comparable quality with those produced by the traditional method.8 Three months after the treatment,masticatory performance was evaluated by a colorimetric assay based on chewing capsules.1 The values obtained for both edentulous groups did not show any significant difference. The masticatory ability assessment, evaluated by a 10-point VAS, did not show statistically significant differences between the traditional and the simplified groups (P=.699). The study concluded that the simplified method was able to restore masticatory function comparably with a traditional protocol, according to participant perceptions.1 The results revealed that complete denture fabrication demanded a median time of173.2 minutes for the simplified group and 284.5 minutes for the traditional group (P<.05).2 The simplified group presented lower costs than traditional group during the fabrication stage but not during the follow-up stage. The Direct cost of complete denture treatment was 34.9%lower for the simplified method.DISCUSSION This study assigned PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statements 10 This study assigned PRISMA statement 21 for systematic reviews to evaluate the clinical efficiency of complete dentures made by simplified methods when compared with the traditional method. The search revealed a low number of studies in the literature that compared these methods in well-designed randomized clinical trials,defined by the NHMRC (National Health and Medical Research Council) guidelines 22as level II, with blinded examiners and predefined follow-up evaluation periods.Acceptable sample sizes were verified in the majority of the studies. Unfortunately, a quantitative systematic review or meta-analysis was not conducted because of the different methodologies applied.Denture fabrication methods taught by dental schools often demand a complex sequence of clinical and laboratory procedures based on the assumption that complex methods result in better treatment quality.1,2,8,Nevertheless, the need for such procedures has been questioned because of the lack of evidence that dentures fabricated by complex methods are preferred by patients.1,2,7,8 Another argument against the use of complex methods is the short time available for teaching complete denture prosthodontics in dental school.2,3,8 Over recent years, several simplified methods for complete denture fabrication have been described.1-3,6-8 Such approaches include simplification or even avoiding some clinical or laboratory procedures, andclaim to result in clinically adequate dentures with a lower use of resources, which suggests good applicability.Three studies assessed the overall satisfaction of patients but showed different results. One of these studies showed statistical differences 3; the other studies did not.6,This difference can be explained by the differences in the sample size and in the methodology. In 3 studies,the simplified techniques were different from each other.3,6,8The assessment instruments also were different. VAS was used to assess overall patient satisfaction with the prosthesis in studies by Kawai et al6andHeydecke et al,3 and a questionnaire was used by Regiset al8and Kawai et al6; Kawai et al6and Regis et al found no significant differences between the simplified and traditional methods for overall satisfaction; however,Heydecke et al reported better values for simplified methods. Kawai et al6and Regis et al also analyzed the technical quality of the prosthesis and did not find statistically significant differences between the techniques.For this analysis, Kawai et al 6 recruited 4 blinded examiners and evaluated the prosthesis at the 6-month follow-up. However, Regis et al recruited a single examiner for this assessment at the 3-month follow-up.Cunha et al proposed a quantitative analysis of masticatory efficiency by using the colorimetric technique and found no difference among simplified groups, andRegis et al analyzed the influence of oral health on quality of life through OHIP-EDENT (Oral Health Impact Profile for edentulous patients) and concluded that denture fabrication methods did not influence results.The investigators also stated that these findings were unexpected because it was predictable that simplified prosthesis would demonstrate inferior results.The assessment of differences in time and cost for simplified and traditional methods has been described in 2studies (Kawai et al7and Della Vecchia et al2) that demonstrated that dentists and dental assistants needed less time for fabricating dentures with the simplified method than with the traditional method. This was expected because an average of 4 clinical sessions are needed for the simplified method, whereas the traditional method requires 5 to 6 sessions. Moreover, the final cost of the traditional method was significantly greater (23%,733.59%2). Among the studies, no significant differences between the 2 denture treatment methods were detected for the following variables: comfort, ease of cleaning,speech function, and chewing ability,1,3,6,7 which supports the statement that there is no evidence that the traditional method produces greater patient satisfaction, betterfunction, or higher quality dentures, even for cases classified as difficult to treat based on diagnostic findings.CONCLUSIONS The present systematic review revealed no difference in masticatory variables, patient satisfaction, or quality of conventional dentures produced with the traditional or the simplified methods,evenifthesimplifiedmethodscanvary among the studies. Therefore, analysis of the data indicates that some clinical or laboratory steps can be skipped, which saves clinical time and reduces costs without prejudicing the prosthesis. Dental schools should consider these findings when designing complete denture courses. Nevertheless, the evidence remains unclear because of the small number of available controlled and randomized clinical trials. Thus, further studies with a higher level of evidence,representative sample size, adequate follow-up period, and standardization of methods should be conducted to validate the performance of this treatment option.",-,"1.Cunha TR, Della Vecchia MP, Regis RR, Ribeiro AB, Muglia VA,Mestriner W Jr, et al.

"Prevalence of comorbidities in rheumatoid arthritis and evaluation of their monitoring: results of an international, cross-sectional study (COMORA)","Maxime Dougados, Martin Soubrier, Anna Antunez, Peter Balint, Alejandro Balsa, Maya H Buch, Gustavo Casado, Jacqueline Detert, Bassel El-zorkany, Paul Emery, Najia Hajjaj-Hassouni, Masayoshi Harigai, Shue-Fen Luo, Reka Kurucz,Gabriel Maciel, Emilio Martin Mola, CarloMaurizio Montecucco, Iain McInnes, Helga Radner, Josef S Smolen, Yeong-Wook Song, Harald Erwin Vonkeman, Kevin Winthrop, Jonathan Kay","Background Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk of developing comorbid conditions. Objectives To evaluate the prevalence of comorbidities and compare their management in RA patients from different countries worldwide.Methods Study design: international, cross-sectional. Patients: consecutive RA patients. Data collected: demographics, disease characteristics (activity, severity, treatment), comorbidities (cardiovascular, infections,cancer, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, osteoporosis and psychiatric disorders). Results Of 4586 patients recruited in 17 participating countries, 3920 were analysed (age, 56±13 years; disease duration, 10±9 years (mean±SD); female gender, 82%; DAS28 (Disease Activity Score using 28 joints)– erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 3.7±1.6(mean±SD); Health Assessment Questionnaire, 1.0±0.7(mean±SD); past or current methotrexate use, 89%; pastor current use of biological agents, 39%. The most frequently associated diseases (past or current) were: depression, 15%; asthma, 6.6%; cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke), 6%; solid malignancies (excluding basal cell carcinoma), 4.5%; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 3.5%. High intercountry variability was observed for both the prevalence of comorbidities and the proportion of subjects complying with recommendations for preventing and managing comorbidities. The systematic evaluation of comorbidities in this study detected abnormalities in vital signs, such as elevated blood pressure in 11.2%, and identified conditions that manifest as laboratory test abnormalities,such as hyperglycaemia in 3.3% and hyperlipidaemia in 8.3%. Conclusions Among RA patients, there is a high prevalence of comorbidities and their risk factors. In this multinational sample, variability among countries was wide, not only in prevalence but also in compliance with recommendations for preventing and managing these comorbidities. Systematic measurement of vital signs and laboratory testing detects otherwise unrecognised comorbid conditions.","INTRODUCTION The long-term prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis(RA) has improved dramatically following the introduction of highly effective medications, such as methotrexate leflunomide and biological agents,12 and as the result of close monitoring and regular adjustment of treatment to the targets of low disease activity or remission.3 However, comorbidities may shorten the lifespan of patients with RA.4–6th Higher death rate appears to be the consequence of an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease, a greater incidence of infections, and the development of certain malignancies in patients with RA.7–11 Also, osteoporotic fractures are more commonly observed in patients with RA and significantly affect the prognosis for functional decline.12 13 In addition, RA patients with more comorbidities experience greater functional impairment.14Some of these comorbidities are observed more often among RA patients because of the medications with which they are treated, especially glucocorticoids,10 and because of traditional risk factors,such as tobacco smoking.15 However, chronically active inflammation also predisposes to the development of these comorbidities.16 Unfortunately, comorbidities are not well managed in RA patients.17–20 To address this disparity, the European League Against Rheumatism(EULAR) proposed specific recommendations for detecting and managing specific comorbidities and preventing their development when possible. These Include recommendations that all patients with RA should be vaccinated against influenza every year and against pneumococci every 5 years 21 and should be evaluated for cardiovascular risk annually.Because chronically active inflammation contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease, these recommendations suggest that the cardiovascular risk score be multiplied by a factor of 1.5 when two of the following three criteria are met: (1) disease duration longer than 10 years; (2) presence of circulating rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies; (3) presence of extra-articular manifestations.22 The COMORA (COMOrbidities in Rheumatoid Arthritis)Study had two major objectives. The First was to evaluate variability in the prevalence of comorbidities and their risk factors between participating countries. The second was to assess whether there is a disparity between existing national recommendations and the actions implemented in daily clinical practice to detect and prevent the development of these comorbidities.PATIENTS AND METHODS Study design This was a cross-sectional, observational, multicentre, international study.Patient recruitment The scientific committee chose national principal investigators for this study. Their task was to select rheumatologists who would be representative of their country and to conduct the study in accordance with good clinical practice. The protocol was reviewed and approved by all local institutional review boards or ethics committees. Consecutive patients visiting theparticipating rheumatologists were invited to enrol in the study if they were at least 18 years of age, fulfilled the 1987 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for RA,23andwe able to understand and complete the questionnaires that were administered. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before enrolment.Sample size The sample size calculation was based on the precision (width)of the 95% CI of the proportions of expected events (eg, prevalence of each comorbidity). For example, it was calculated that a sample of 4000 patients would allow the 35% prevalence of a given comorbidity, X, to be estimated with a precision of 1.5%(95% CI 33.5% to 36.5%), or the 1% prevalence of another comorbidity, Y, to be estimated with a precision of 0.3% (95%CI 0.7% to 1.3%).Investigators in each participating country were expected to enrol at least 200 patients.Data collect A case report form specifically created for this study was used to collect four categories of data.1.Characteristics of demographics and the disease.Patients’demographic characteristics included: age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake, marital status, socio-economic status and highest level of education completed.Disease activity was assessed using the DAS28 (Disease Activity Score using 28 joints)–erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)24 and the C-reactive protein level. Disease severity was evaluated from the history of joint surgery to address structural damage caused by RA (eg, total joint arthroplasty, arthrodesis, metacarpophalangeal or metatarsophalangeal joint resections). Past And current medications used to treat RA were also recorded,including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and conventional and biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).2.History or current evidence of comorbidities. Ischaemic cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke), cancers(colon, skin, lung, breast and uterus for women, prostate formen) and lymphoma, gastrointestinal diseases (diverticulitis,ulcers), infections (hepatitis), lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma) and psychiatric disorders (depression).3.Coexisting risk factors. Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, family history of myocardial infarction or sudden death), risk factors for infectious diseases and vaccination status, risk factors for cancers (family history of prostate, breast or colon cancer;adenomatous polyposis and/or personal history of inflammatory bowel disease (for colon cancer) and history of numerous (>40) nevi for skin cancer).4.Compliance with current national recommendations regarding management ( prevention, detection and treatment) of these comorbidities. For example, annual estimation of cardiovascular risk.For each patient, information was gathered by a study investigator during a face-to-face interview at a dedicated study visit and through review of the medical record.Data analysis The first step of the analysis was to describe the baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients, by country, including the prevalence of each comorbidity and associated disease risk factors (%and 95% CI).To estimate any disparity that might exist between published recommendations and daily clinical practice in the prevention,detection and management of these comorbidities, the percentage of patients monitored and managed according to national guidelines was calculated. The definition of‘optimal’management for the evaluated comorbidities was primarily based on recommendations made by international scientific societies 17 18 and/or national healthcare systems 25 and/or the recommendations of the French Society of Rheumatology to prevent, detect and control comorbidities in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases.26 For cardiovascular diseases, a patient was considered to be optimally monitored when risk factors for cardiovascular events(eg, blood pressure, blood glucose level, low-density lipoprotein(LDL) cholesterol level) were evaluated annually. Patients older than 50 years were considered to be managed optimally if they were receiving an antithrombotic drug, in the setting of a post thrombotic cardiovascular event, or if their Framingham Risk Score 27 was calculated to be 20% or more above the upper limit of normal after being adjusted for RA (multiplied by a factor of 1.5), in the presence of specific RA characteristics.22 Finally, we evaluated the proportion of patients in whom the systematic evaluation of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases during the conduct of the study detected hypertension (eg, systolic pressure>140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure >80 mm Hg or>130 mm Hg and 70 mm Hg, respectively, in the setting of concomitant diabetes mellitus 26), elevated LDL cholesterol(above the targeted value defined with regard to the number of concomitant additional cardiovascular risk factors 28) and hyperglycaemia (random blood glucose level >1.26 g/L28).A patient was considered to be monitored optimally for infectious diseases if he or she had had (1) a dental examination within the previous year, (2) an influenza vaccination within the previous year, and (3) a pneumococcal vaccination within the previous 5 years.A patient was considered to be monitored optimally for cancerif age- and sex-appropriate cancer screening recommendations for the general population were followed. A male patient without known prostate cancer was considered to have been screened optimally for prostate cancer if a digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level had been performed between the ages of 50 and 75 years (or between the ages of 45 and 75 years for patients of African ancestry) or with at least two first-degree relatives who had prostate cancer. Subsequently, this evaluation had to have been repeated every 3 years for those with PSA <1 ng/mL and annually for those with PSA between 1 and 4 ng/mL. For men with PSA >4 ng/mL, evaluation by an urologist was required for the patient to be considered to have been monitored optimally.28 For breast cancer detection, a woman between the ages of 50 and 74 years without known breast cancer was considered to have been screened optimally if a mammogram had been performed within 2 years of the study visit.28 For uterine cancer detection, a woman between the ages of 25 and 65 years without known uterine cancer was considered to have been monitored optimally if a Papanicolaou smear of the cervix had been performed within 3 years of the study visit.28 For colon cancer screening, a patient over 50 years old without known colon cancer was considered to have been optimally monitored if stool had been tested for occult blood and at least one colonoscopy had been performed. For those patients at high risk of developing colon cancer (eg, those with inflammatory bowel disease or with at least two first-degree relatives who had colon or rectal cancer or at least one first-degree relative with adenomatous polyposis or with Lynch syndrome), a colonoscopy had to have been performed in the 2 years before the study visit for a patient to be considered to have been optimally monitored.28 For Skin cancer detection, a patient was considered to be optimally monitored if he or she had been examined at least once by a dermatologist; if more than 40 nevi were present, annual evaluation by a dermatologist was required for optimal monitoring.28 For lung cancer screening, a patient was considered to have been monitored optimally if a chest radiograph had been performed after the onset of RA.26A patient was considered to have been screened optimally for osteoporosis if at least one bone densitometry study had been performed after the onset of RA and if he or she was taking vitamin D supplementation at the time of the study visit.26 RESULTS Patients and study courseS total of 4586 patients were recruited by investigators in the 17 participating countries between 2011 and 2012. Because a disproportionately high number of subjects were enrolled in South Korea (n=1052) compared with each of the other 16 countries,400 patients from South Korea were randomly selected for inclusion in the analysis. Fourteen patients from a single centre were excluded from the current analysis because of too many missing data, leaving a total of 3920 patients for further evaluation.The baseline characteristics are summarised in table 1. There Was enormous intercountry variability for some characteristics:patients in North Africa tended to have more active and more severe disease, and fewer patients in some South American Countries had been treated with biological agents. Detailed comparisons of the baseline characteristics for each individual country are provided in online supplementary tables S1 and S2.Prevalence of comorbidities The prevalence of those comorbidities that were evaluated is depicted in figure 1. Depression (past or current symptoms) was the most commonly observed comorbidity (mean 15.0%, 95%CI 13.8% to 16.1%); however, the prevalence of depression varied widely among countries (from 2% in Morocco to 33%in the USA).There was a history of ischaemic cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or stroke) in 6.0% (95% CI 5.3% to 6.8%) ofthe patients. This prevalence ranged from a low of 1% in Morocco to a high of 17% in Hungary. A history of any solid tumour, excluding basal cell skin cancers, was found in 4.5%(95% CI 3.9% to 5.2%) of the patients and ranged from a low of0.3% in Egypt to a high of 12.5% in the USA). Hepatitis B infection was observed more frequently in Italy (9%) and Taiwan(7%) than in other countries (2.8% (95% CI 2.3% to 3.3%)).The prevalence of hepatitis C infection was highest in Italy(6.6%), Egypt (6.8%) and Taiwan (4.8%). The overall prevalence of past or present gastrointestinal ulcer was 10.8% (95% CI9.8% to 11.8%). This ranged from a low of 1% in Morocco to a high of 22% in Egypt. Episodes of diverticulitis that had required surgical intervention were rarely observed (0.4% (95% CI 0.2%to 0.6%)). Pulmonary diseases, especially COPD, were observed less commonly in Asian countries (Japan, 1.4%; Korea, 1.3%;Taiwan, 0.3%) than in European countries or the USA (Hungary,8.0%; USA, 7.5%). Detailed listings by country of the prevalence of the various comorbidities, grouped by category, are presented in online supplementary tables S3–S7. Prevalence of risk factors for comorbidities The prevalence of various risk factors for cardiovascular disease and several malignancies is depicted in figure 2. As might be expected, given the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease associated with RA, the most prevalent risk factors were those that predispose to cardiovascular disease, such as increased Framingham Risk Score (42.8% (95% CI 41.2% to44.3%)), hypertension (40.4% (95% CI 38.9% to 41.9%)) and hypercholesterolaemia (31.7% (95% CI 30.3% to 33.2%)). Aswith the prevalence of comorbidities, there was considerable intercountry variability in the prevalence of risk factors. For Example, the prevalence of smoking ranged from 3% in Morocco to 48% in Austria. Detailed listings by country of the prevalence of the various risk factors, grouped by comorbidity,are presented in online supplementary tables S8 and S9.Management of comorbidities Cardiovascular diseases Annual evaluation of cardiovascular risk, including measurement of blood pressure, total serum cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and LDL), blood glucose and serum creatinine, was performed in 59.4% (95% CI 57.9% to 60.9%) of the patients. Of the 236 patients who had a prior myocardial infarction or stroke, 162 (68.6%) were currently receiving an antithrombotic drug, but 74 (31.4%) were not. Among the other 3684 patients who had no history of myocardial infarction or stroke, 366 would appropriately have been given prophylactic antithrombotic drug treatment because they were older than 50 years and had a calculated Framingham Risk Score above 20%; however, of these, 299 were not receiving any antithrombotic agent. Thus, 373 (9.5%) of the total number of patients enrolled in this study should have been treated with antithrombotic drug prophylaxis, but were not being managed optimally to prevent cardiovascular events (figure 3).The systematic assessment of certain cardiovascular risk factors in this study allowed their detection in previously undiagnosed patients. Among the 2489 patients without known hypertension, elevated blood pressure was detected in 454(18%). An elevated blood glucose level was detected in 131(3.7%) of the 3522 patients without previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus. An LDL cholesterol level above the optimal target was detected in 325 (11.0%) of the 2966 patients not previously diagnosed to have a dyslipidemia or not receiving lipid-lowering therapy.Infectious diseases During the year before the study visit, 42.3% (95% CI 40.8%to 43.9%) of all 3920 enrolled patients had undergone a dental examination. However, fewer patients were vaccinated in accordance with current recommendations: an influenza vaccination had been performed during the year before the study visit only 938 (25.3% (95% CI 23.9% to 26.7%)) of the patients and a pneumococcal vaccination had been performed within 5 years of the study visit in only 636 (17.2% (95% CI 16.0% to 18.4%)) of the patients. Both an influenza and a pneumococcal vaccination were performed according to current recommendations in only 316 (10.3% (95% CI 9.3% to 11.4%)) of the patients.Cancer Optimal screening for malignancies, according to recommended guidelines, was performed in only 909 (23.9%) of the patients for skin cancers, 608 (26.7%) of the patients for colon cancer,202 (38.2%) of the patients for prostate cancer, 938 (51.5%) ofthe patients for breast cancer, and 1383 (59.3%) of the patients for uterine cancer.Osteoporosis Bone densitometry had been performed at least once in 2281(58.2% (95% CI 56.6% to 59.7%)) of the 3920 patients. Of all enrolled patients, 1733 (44.4% (95% CI 42.9% to 46.0%))were receiving vitamin D supplementation at the time of the study visit.Detailed listings by country of the percentage of patients optimally monitored for cardiovascular, infectious and cancer diseases are presented in online supplementary tables S10–S12.DISCUSSION This is the first population-based, cross-sectional observational study to assess multiple comorbidities and their management among a relatively large sample of patients with RA who were enrolled by rheumatologists in 17 participating countries on five different continents. This study confirms not only the relatively high prevalence of comorbidities among patients with RA, but also considerable intercountry variability in the prevalence of these comorbidities.29 It demonstrates that, at present, the management of comorbidities in patients with RA is far from optimal. As in this study, the systematic evaluation of patients for evidence of comorbidities may uncover previously undiagnosed conditions in some patients.An important aim of this study was to evaluate the gap between current recommendations for detecting, managing and preventing comorbidities and their implementation in observed daily practice. To accomplish this objective, the scientific committee for the study created an a priori definition of optimal monitoring based largely on current recommendations provided by various international medical organisations. The optimal LDL cholesterol level on which the analysis of this study was based is that currently recommended by the French Ministry of Health,28 and this standard was applied to all study subjects in all participating countries regardless of local recommendations. However,for comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, definitions were country-specific, and recommendations for monitoring or pre-vention varied slightly between participating countries. For Example, the indication for initiation of antithrombotic drugs prophylaxis was a history of a prior cardiovascular event in some countries and a >20% risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event based on the Framingham Risk Score in others.27 Had this study used other standards for the detection, management and prevention of comorbidities,30 31 it might have found slightly different proportions. Regardless, this study demonstrates that compliance with recommended strategies is far from perfect and that this varies significantly among countries.Although this study has numerous strengths, it also has several weaknesses. The comorbidities evaluated were selected for the study by the scientific committee and were not all-inclusive; some important comorbidities, such as tuberculosis, were not among those assessed. Despite the principal investigators in each country having been instructed to recruit rheumatologists working in different practice settings to enrolL patients, it cannot be guaranteed that the prevalent cohort of 3920 patients studied here were fully representative of allRA patients in the participating countries. The study did not enrol RA patients from general practices who were not under the care of a rheumatologist. Moreover, some of the intercountry variability in the degree of RA disease activity observed in this study might reflect differences in the reason for which the patient was visiting the rheumatologist at the time of study participation: in some countries, patients are evaluated routinely even when their RA is under good control, whereas, in other countries, patients go to see their rheumatologist only when they experience a flare of disease activity. Also, cultural differences among patients recruited from different countries might lead to diverse interpretations of questions included in the questionnaire. Varied interpretation of the term‘depression’by subjects in different countries could account, in part, for the wide differences observed across countries in the prevalence of depression.Several different types of bias are inherent in a prevalent cohort study of a chronic disease. The prevalence of some comorbidities might be overestimated because of diagnostic bias,in that patients with RA may more likely be offered screening for recognised comorbidities, or because of reporting bias, inthat RA patients may more likely be diagnosed with comorbidities known to be associated with this inflammatory disease. The Prevalence of other comorbidities might be underestimated because of truncation bias, in that RA patients with potentially life-threatening comorbidities may have been lost from the population before the cohort was enrolled. These biases may produce diverse effects in different countries. The lack of a comparator group without RA did not allow comparison in this study between the observed prevalence of comorbidities and their optimal management among RA patients with that in the general population or among patients with another disease state.This study achieved its main objective, which was to evaluate and demonstrate intercountry variation in the detection, manage-ment and prevention of comorbidities among RA patients. It Shows clear differences in the prevalence of certain risk factors,which might influence national policies regarding prevention strategies. For example, the high prevalence of tobacco smoking foundamong RA patients in the Netherlands (41.2%) and Austria(47.5%) might prompt targeted programmes to reduce this behaviour, which clearly predisposes not only to the development ofRA,32 but also to cardiovascular disease 33 and lung cancer,34 both of which are also significant comorbidities of RA. Other studies that have compared the prevalence of comorbidities among patients with those in the general population have shown a higher prevalence of cardiovascular events,8infections,10 11osteoporoticfractures12and lung cancer 14 among RA patients. Nevertheless,the relatively large sample of RA patients who were enrolled from 17 countries on various continents allowed the present study to confirm the high prevalence of hepatitis in Asia 35 36 and southern European countries 37 and in Egypt.38 39 This study confirms the observation that monitoring of patients for cardiovascular risk is suboptimal 19 40–42 and extends this assumption to other comorbidities. Moreover, it demonstrates that systematic assessment of RA patients for comorbidities facilitates the detection of abnormalities such as elevated blood pressure, hyperglycaemia and hypercholesterolaemia. These Findings are in agreement with those of previous studies that suggested that cardiovascular risk factors are not optimally monitored and managed in 30–50% of RA patients.40 41 Given the findings of the present study, the question arises as to how best to improve this situation. The treating rheumatologist should consider the periodic assessment of comorbidities as one of the tasks involved in treating a patient with RA. This should be carried out in collaboration with primary care providers and other specialists who are involved in the care of these patients. However,the increasing complexity of managing treatment of RA with effective combinations of traditional and biological DMARDs in the setting of progressively decreasing amounts of time available for direct interaction with the patient makes this additional responsibility challenging. The development and implementation of standardised programmes to detect, manage and prevent comorbidities in daily clinical practice, working in partnership with other healthcare providers such as nurses,42 43 might greatly facilitate the identification of and intervention to reduce the prevalence of comorbidities among patients with RA.",-,"1 Shourt CA, Crowson CS, Gabriel SE,et al.

"Older age, comorbidity, glucocorticoid use and disease activity are risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalisation in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases","Rebecca Hasseli, Ulf Muller- Ladner, Bimba F Hoyer, Andreas Krause, Hanns- Martin Lorenz, Alexander Pfeil, Jutta Richter, Martin Schäfer , Tim Schmeiser, Anja Strangfeld, Hendrik Schulze- Koops , Reinhard E Voll,Christof Specker, Anne Constanze Regierer","Introduction Whether patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) are at higher risk to develop severe courses of COVID-19 has not been fully elucidated. Aim of this analysis was to describe patients with RMD according to their COVID-19 severity and to identify risk factors for hospitalisation. Methods Patients with RMD with PCR confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infection reported to the German COVID-19 registry from 30 March to 1 November 2020 were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate ORs for hospitalisation due to COVID-19.Results Data from 468 patients with RMD with SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. Most frequent diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis, RA (48%). 29% of the patients were hospitalised, 5.5% needed ventilation. 19 patients died. Multivariable analysis showed that age >65 years (OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.12 to 4.47), but even more>75 years (OR 3.94; 95% CI 1.86 to 8.32), cardiovascular disease (CVD; OR 3.36; 95% CI 1.5 to 7.55), interstitial lung disease/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ILD/COPD) (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.2 to 6.49), chronic kidney disease (OR 2.96; 95% CI 1.16 to 7.5), moderate/high RMD disease activity (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.02 to 3.76) and treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) in dosages >5 mg/day (OR 3.67; 95% CI 1.49 to 9.05) were associated with higher odds of hospitalisation. Spondyloarthritis patients showed a smaller risk of hospitalisation compared with RA (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.91).Conclusion Age was a major risk factor for hospitalisation as well as comorbidities such as CVD, ILD/COPD, chronic kidney disease and current or prior treatment with GCs. Moderate to high RMD disease activity was also an independent risk factor for hospitalisation, underlining the importance of continuing adequate RMD treatment during the pandemic","INTRODUCTION In Germany, the first cases of SARS- CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) were reported at the end of January 2020.1 Similar to other European countries, SARS- CoV-2 spread rapidly in Germany. The course of infection with SARS- CoV-2 ranges from asymptomatic to fatal. In the general population, higher age, male gender and comorbidities are associated with the severity of SARS- CoV-2 infection.2 3 Since the outbreak of the pandemic, concerns have been raised regarding the probability of developing a severe or even life- threatening course in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD).4–6 Patients with RMD are characterised by an overall increase in risk of infection due to the autoimmune disease itself and immunomodulatory drugs.7–9 The risk of infection is dependent on age, functional capacity, comorbidities and immunomodulatory treatment with biological disease- modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and glucocorticoids (GC).10 Immunomodulatory drugs with anti- inflammatory action may limit overwhelming immune responses that appear to be responsible for the severe pulmonary complications in COVID-19.11 12 However, not all immunomodulatory treatments seem to influence the risk for a critical course in the same direction. Whereas registry data had shown a beneficial effect of biological DMARDs regarding the development of sepsis and mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and serious infections, it had also shown a significantly increased risk conveyed with GCs.13 Data from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance (GRA) physician- reported registry indicate that GC ≥10 mg/day are associated with a higher hospitalisation rate with SARS- CoV-2 infection in patients with RMD,14 which underlines the importance of controlling disease activity with DMARDs in order to decrease GC dose.Furthermore, the recommendations from EULAR and DGRh (German Society for Rheumatology) state that immunomodulating therapy should be maintained during the SARS- CoV-2 pandemic to avoid RMD relapse.15 16 Limited data are available as for whether and to what extent patients with RMD are at an increased risk for SARS- CoV-2 infection 11 17 18 and for a more severe course of COVID-19. For this reason, a national registry was established allowing a rapid and timely collection of RMD cases with confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infections in Germany in order to analyse the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with RMD and to develop guidance for the management of patients with RMD during the COVID-19 pandemic.19 The aim of this analysis was to identify risk factors for hospitalisation, comparing non- hospitalised patients with RMD to hospitalised patients, stratified by the need for invasive ventilation.METHODS Data source In March 2020, the German Society for Rheumatology, together with the Justus- Liebig- University Giessen, founded a national registry for patients with pre- existing inflammatory rheumatic diseases (RMD) and SARS- CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR test. Rheumatologists voluntarily enter the data into an online database with implemented plausibility checks (URL https://www. covid19- rheuma. de).The ascertained data include SARS- CoV-2 infection- specific items such as symptoms, duration, treatment and outcome, RMD specific items such as diagnosis, physician assessed disease activity (categorised into remission, low, moderate or high disease activity), and treatment of RMD, and general items such as socio demographic information and comorbidities. Missing data on diagnosis and treatment of RMD and outcome of COVID-19 can be queried by contacting participating physicians. Data collection was done retrospectively. Participating centres consist of academic and non- academic rheumatology departments and private practices in Germany.The German registry’s content is harmonised with the EULAR COVID-19 database (https://www. eular. org/ eular_ covid19_ database. cfm) to allow joint analysis. The study is registered at EuDRACT 2020-001958-21#.Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were applied to compare non- hospitalised patients with hospitalised patients, either without or with invasive ventilation.Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs for the main outcome parameter of this analysis, which is hospitalisation due to COVID-19 as indicator for severity of the SARS- CoV-2 infection. Simple logistic regressions with one explanatory variable were performed to determine the set of regressors for the multivariable regression. Variables with a p<0.1 were included in the final model. Covariates included in the model were age group, rheumatic disease group (RA, spondyloarthritis, connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and vasculitis, other rheumatic diseases), inflammatory activity of the rheumatic disease, specific comorbidities (cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension without CVD, interstitial lung diseases (ILD) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cancer), prior and/or current use of GC (none, up to 5 mg/day, over 5 mg/day). Spondyloarthritis included psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and enteropathic arthritis. CTDs and vasculitis included systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, mixed CTDs, overlap syndromes, polymyalgia rheumatica, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic GPA, microscopic polyangiitis, large vessel vasculitis, Behçet’s disease and other types of vasculitis. For patients belonging to more than one rheumatic disease category, we used the following hierarchy for prioritisation: CTD/vasculitis>RA>spondyloarthritides>other rheumatic diseases. In this way, disjoint categories are created, establishing a clear reference group for interpretation of the regression model and avoiding collinearities. In order to avoid collinearity between CVD and hypertension, hypertension in the model refers to patients who had hyper-tension but not CVD. Missing values for obesity, disease activity state, GC dose and non- steroidal antirheumatic agents were derived by multiple imputation using full conditional specification.20 Results of the logistic regression analyses for 10 imputed datasets were pooled by Rubin’s rules. Calculations were carried out with the software packages SAS, V.9.4, and R, V.3.6.3.RESULT Patients characteristics Between March 30 (first patient in) and 1 November 2020 (database lock), 468 patients with RMD and a PCR- confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infection were documented in the German registry, 309 patients were female. Median age was 57 years. Regarding RMD diagnosis, RA was most common with 48%, followed by 14% PsA, and 12% axSpA.Patient characteristics are shown in table 1, stratified into the three groups: non- hospitalised patients, hospitalised patients without or with need for invasive ventilation. The following numbers of missing values exist: 88 (18.8%) for duration of COVID-19 symptoms, 51 (10.9%) for obesity, 31 (6.6%) for inflammatory activity state, 1 for GC dose (0.6%, among patients receiving GCs) and 33 (7.1%) for non- steroidal antirheumatic drugs. There was no missing data on outcome of SARS- CoV-2 infection, so all patients either fully recovered or died.Of the 468 patients, 136 (29%) were hospitalised of whom 26 (5.5%) needed invasive ventilation. 19 patients died, resulting in a case fatality rate of 4%. Eighteen of these patients died in the hospital, 13 had received invasive ventilation.Most patients with RMD had comorbidities; only 38% did not have any other chronic condition. The most frequent comorbidity was arterial hypertension, followed by obesity, CVD and diabetes.Regarding RMD treatment, 19% of the patients did not receive any DMARD. Thirty- six per cent were on bDMARDs and 41% on conventional synthetic (cs)DMARD monotherapy. Thirty- nine per cent of the patients were on GC treatment, most of them (81%) received low dose GCs of ≤5 mg/day.Comparison of non-hospitalised patients with hospitalised patients without ventilation and hospitalised patients with invasive ventilation The percentage of men was larger among hospitalised patients with ventilation (50%) compared with those without ventilation (32%) or non- hospitalised (34%) (table 1).Forty- four per cent of the non- hospitalised patients suffered from RA, compared with 56% and 65% in the hospitalised groups. According to physicians’ assessments, moderate to high RMD disease activity was present in 11% of the non- hospitalised patients, 26% in the hospitalised patients without ventilation and 34% in the ventilated patients.Regarding RMD treatment, 18% of the non- hospitalised patients did not receive any DMARD compared with 24% and 19% in the hospitalised groups. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were documented as RMD treatment in 27% of the non- hospitalised patients, in 12% of the hospitalised group without ventilation and 8% in the ventilated patients. Twenty- seven per cent of the ventilated patients were on B- cell- depletion treatment, whereas only 3% of the non- hospitalised and 6% of the hospitalised patients without ventilation had received B- cell- depleting treatment.Factors associated with hospitalisation Results of the univariate analyses comparing non- hospitalised patients with hospitalised patients are shown in table 2.The results of the multivariable model are shown in figure 1 and online supplemental table 1). Age>65 years (OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.12 to 4.47), but even more>75 years (OR 3.94; 95% CI 1.86 to 8.32), CVD (OR 3.36; 95% CI 1.5 to 7.55), lung disease (ILD/COPD) (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.2 to 6.49) and chronic kidney disease (OR 2.96; 95% CI 1.16 to 7.5) were associated with higher odds of hospitalisation. Patients with spondyloarthritides showed a lower risk of hospitalisation compared with RA (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.91). Moderate to high RMD disease activity was furthermore significantly associated with hospitalisation (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.02 to 3.76), as well as treatment with GC in dosages>5 mg/day (OR 3.67; 95% CI 1.49 to 9.05).DISCUSSION In the challenging situation of the SARS- CoV-2 pandemic, physicians and patients need rapid access to the evolving evidence to close the gaps of knowledge which are stressful for patients with chronic conditions. When the pandemic started, it was unclear whether patients with RMD are at an increased risk to get infected or whether they have a higher risk of a severe course of COVID-19. In this analysis, hospitalisation was used as indicator for a more severe course. Older age, CVD, ILD/COPD, chronic kidney disease, treatment with GC at doses of >5 mg/day, and moderate to high RMD disease activity were identified as independent risk factors for hospitalisation.Our results are in line with the recently published analysis of the GRA.14 In the GRASS analysis, the cases from the German registry had not yet been included, so these two cohorts are independent. Similar results have also been found in a meta- analysis on autoinflammatory diseases including RMDs.21 Age seems to be the most important factor associated with a more severe course of COVID192 3 22 23 and this holds also true for patients with RMD as described in our analysis and other reports.24–28 Importantly, moderate to high RMD disease activity was identified as an independent risk factor for hospitalisation. This is an important finding, not only in that this is a risk factor specifically related to RMDs but also with implications for the daily management, reaffirming recent recommendations that state the importance of RMD disease control during the pandemic.15 16 The influence of comorbidities is also widely recognised since the first reports of COVID-19.29 In our cohort, CVD, ILD/COPD and chronic kidney disease were significantly associated with hospitalisation. Interestingly, asthma was not associated with an increased risk as was also described in the UK.3 This is in accordance with an asthma- specific analysis where the authors did not find an association of asthma with hospitalisation.30 This effect is in contrast to other pulmonary comorbidities such as ILD and COPD.In our cohort, prior or current treatment with GC was associated with a high risk of hospitalisation in accordance with the GRA analysis 14 and with previous evidence of an increased infection risk in general.10The interpretation of the influence of GC treatment on hospitalisation has to be performed with caution. There is a probability of confounding by indication since GC are given under certain circumstances which may influence the outcome itself like a high disease activity of the RMD. Since uncontrolled RMD activity also enhances the risk of infections, our results should not encourage stopping GC treatment. However, GC should be administered in the lowest possible dose, as recommended by the recently published guidance for the management of COVID-19 in RMD,15 16 as already a dose of >5 mg/day was associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation in our study.Male gender has also been described as an important risk factor for a more severe course and higher mortality.3 23 In our analysis, male gender was not associated with hospitalisation. This was also the case in the GRASS analysis.14 However, regarding the results of the descriptive analysis (table 1), male gender was much more common in the group of ventilated patients compared with the other patients. As already described in the general population, male gender might therefore be associated with a worse outcome also in patients with RMD.3 23 31 Comparing the results from RMD with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), interesting parallels can be found. In the first analysis of the international registry for patients with IBD and confirmed SARS- Cov-2 infection, similar risk factors associated with worse COVID-19 outcome were identified, namely older age, number of comorbidities and use of systemic GC.32 The strengths of our study include the large sample size with PCR confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infections in patients with RMD. As all patients were treated in Germany, both the healthcare system and treatment strategies for COVID-19 were comparable in all cases, reducing confounding due to differences regarding these factors as might be present in analyses including patients from many countries. The completeness of data is high with only a small percentage of missing values. Particularly, the outcome ‘hospitalisation’ was known in all cases, as all cases were documented after full recovery or death of patient.A limitation of our study is the observational design, which is prone to confounding by indication. For example, it is possible that patients taking GCs might be hospitalised more often because of the potential risk of a more severe outcome of the infection. Also, a potential influence of the SARS- CoV-2 infection on the course of the RMD cannot be assessed based on our data because of the cross- sectional design. Only few details of the RMD are known, as factors like disease duration, functional capacity or treatment history are not captured in the registry.Although this is one of the largest RMD COVID-19 cohorts published so far, the number of cases was still too low to include specific RMD treatments into the multivariable analysis. With increasing numbers of patients, these analyses will probably become possible in the near future.Another limitation is that possibly more severe cases were preferably documented, resulting in a selection bias. However, we believe that the conclusions drawn from our model are robust since there is no indication that the impact of age, disease activity, specific comorbidities or GC treatment is influenced by this bias.In this large German cohort of patients with RMD with SARS- CoV-2 infection, 29% were hospitalised. Age, RMD disease activity, CVD, ILD/COPD and GC treatment starting at doses of >5mg/day were independently associated with hospitalisation. These risk factors are similar to those found in general COVID-19 cohorts. However, to our knowledge, this is the first analysis identifying moderate to high RMD disease activity as independent risk factor for hospitalisation due to COVID-19. It is important to continue the documentation of patients with RMDs and COVID-19 in order to generate more evidence for counselling and to find the best therapeutic management of our patients.Author affiliations Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Campus Kerkhoff, Justus- Liebig- University, Giessen, Giessen, Germany Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Clinic for Internal Medicine I, University of Schleswig- Holstein at Kiel, Kiel, Germany Department of Rheumatology, Clinical Immunology and Osteology, Immanuel Hospital, Berlin, Germany 4 Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany 5 Department of Internal Medicine III, Universitätsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany6 Department of Rheumatology and Hiller Research Unit, Medical Faculty, Heinrich- Heine- Universität Düsseldorf, Dusseldorf, Nordrhein- Westfalen, Germany 7 Epidemiology Unit, German Rheumatism Research Center Berlin, Berlin, German y8 Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Saint Joseph Hospital, Wuppertal, Germany 9 Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine IV, University of Munich, Munich, Germany 10Dep. of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University of Freiburg Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany 11 Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Kliniken Essen- Mitte, Essen, Germany Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank all physicians (Boeddeker, Stephanie;

Obstructive lung diseases and risk of rheumatoid arthritis,"H. Maura Friedlander, Julia A. Ford, Alessandra Zaccardelli, Alexsandra V. Terrio, Michael H. Cho, Jeffrey A. Sparks","Introduction: Smoking is an established risk factor for both lung diseases and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Chronic mucosal airway inflammation may result in immune tolerance loss, neoantigen formation, and production of RA-related autoantibodies that increase the subsequent risk of RA. In this review, we aimed to summarize the current evidence supporting the role of obstructive lung diseases and subsequent risk of RA.Areas covered: We identified scientific articles discussing the biologic mechanisms linking mucosal airway inflammation and RA risk. We also identified studies investigating asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, chronic tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections, and interstitial lung disease with subsequent risk for RA.Expert opinion: The current evidence supports the hypothesis that mucosal airway inflammation may increase the risk of developing RA. However, most studies investigating this relationship have been retrospective and may not have adequately addressed the role of smoking. Larger prospective studies may provide stronger evidence for obstructive lung disease and RA risk. Determining the role of obstructive lung disease in RA pathogenesis may provide opportunity for RA prevention and screening strategies, while identifying novel biologic mechanisms that could offer targets to improve treatment and outcomes.

Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common systemic rheumatic disease, affecting nearly 1% of the population, and is characterized by a painful, chronic inflammatory polyarthritis [1]. While the etiology of RA is complex, cigarette smoking is the best-established environmental risk factor for RA [2-4]. Patients with RA are known to have excess respiratory morbidity and mortality compared to the general population [5,6]. Pulmonary involvement as a disease manifestation of RA may affect pleura, airways, parenchyma, blood vessels, and respiratory muscles [7,8]. Patients with RA are also prone to developing interstitial lung disease (ILD), which has particularly high morbidity and mortality [9,10]. Smoking increases mortality more in patients with RA than in the general population, which may be related to these respiratory complications [11]. Therefore, the lung has an established importance in outcomes among patients already diagnosed with RA. However, less is known about the role of the lung in RA pathogenesis.RA is phenotyped as either seropositive (i.e., serum elevation of either anti-citrullinated protein antibodies [ACPA] or rheumatoid factor [RF]) or seronegative (negative blood tests for both ACPA and RF). Smoking specifically increases risk for seropositive RA [2,4]. Patients with seropositive RA are also more likely to develop respiratory complications [5,9,12]. Since many non-smokers develop seropositive RA, other causes of respiratory inflammation may be important in RA pathogenesis. The mucosal paradigm for seropositive RA pathogenesis postulates that RA may develop after loss of immune tolerance due to environmental triggers at mucosal surfaces in genetically susceptible individuals [13,14]. In particular, chronic mucosal airway inflammation could be a nidus for development of RA-related autoantibodies and subsequent risk for systemic inflammation, autoimmunity, and articular inflammation. Alternatively, the lungs may be also be a target of autoimmunity from immune tolerance breakdown that occurs at other anatomic sites.In this review, we will detail the biologic rationale that may link obstructive lung diseases to RA risk. We focus on diseases involving the airways and parenchyma since prior research has not found an association between vocal cord dysfunction or subglottic stenosis with RA risk. We will also discuss the current literature of investigations of particular obstructive lung diseases and RA risk, focusing on asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), muco-obstructive lung diseases, and ILD. Finally, we will summarize the current literature and postulate about future steps.2. Biologic framework for airway inflammation and increased RA riskRA-related autoimmunity has been hypothesized to originate at mucosal surfaces in the lungs or other anatomic sites such as the gingiva, gut, bladder, or reproductive tract [15]. This review will specifically focus on airway mucosa as a potential site of RA genesis. Figure 1 provides a summary of the proposed biological framework linking obstructive lung disease and RA risk. Obstructive lung diseases are a group of complex and heterogeneous diseases and clinical syndromes that result from restricted airflow from a variety of mechanisms. This airflow obstruction can be due to a variety of factors, including tightened bronchiolar smooth muscles and bronchoconstriction; inflamed, thickened airways; excess mucus thickening and secretions; loss of small airways; and parenchymal destruction and loss of elastic recoil. These mechanisms of airflow obstruction are present to varying degrees in different types of obstructive lung diseases. In asthma, individuals with increased genetic risk factors and overactive allergic reactions in combination with external factors such as inhalants, chronic infections, and other pathogens may induce smooth muscle contraction. This in turn causes bronchoconstriction, promoting narrowing of the airway and tissue inflammation [16]. In emphysema, these external factors promote the recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils which promote tissue cell remodeling and destruction, ultimately leading to damaged epithelial cells and air trapping [17]. In muco-obstructive lung diseases like COPD and cystic fibrosis, activation from external factors increases mucin secretion. Elevated mucin concentration, coupled with insufficient ion transport across airway surfaces, causes thickening of airway walls with mucus and impaired airflow [18]. Though some mucus is expelled as sputum, any remaining mucus in the small airways accumulates to form obstructions and promote further inflammation as well as a nidus for infection [19]. In COPD, in addition to airway inflammation, loss of small airways may precede the development of emphysema [20]. Chronic inflammation may lead to inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT), a mucosal lymphoid collection in airways or lung parenchyma, that has been shown to occur in patients with pulmonary complications from RA or Sjögren syndrome and may be important in inducing autoimmunity [21].Genetic susceptibility for obstructive lung diseases has mostly been studied on a disease-specific basis. In asthma, many genetic risk factors (>800) have been investigated that help explain its biologic underpinning [22]. For example, epithelial cytokines have been identified as crucial molecules in susceptibility to airway disease, perhaps due to immune-cell recruitment [22]. IL1RL1 variants have been associated with asthma risk in a diverse range of patient populations [23-26]. A meta-analysis of geographically diverse genome-wide association studies found that many asthma risk loci overlap with genetic variants of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, suggesting shared genetics between asthma and autoimmune diseases such as RA [22].Variants in the HLA region have been associated with lung function and COPD, including HLA-DQB1 and AGER. In addition, the IL27 locus is associated with COPD, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory bowel disease [27,28]. A recent phenome-wide association study investigating variants previously described in association with COPD or related phenotypes found suggestive evidence of an association between the rs207488 single nucleotide polymorphism of HLA-C and increased risk of RA as well as type 1 diabetes and bronchiectasis [29]. These findings suggest that autoimmunity and COPD may be intrinsically connected. Other COPD susceptibility genes such as HHIP may increase RA risk through effects on worsened pulmonary function, resulting in chronic lung damage that may induce local inflammatory milieu and promote RA-related autoimmunity. Gene-smoking interactions have been described in both RA and COPD, which may explain bidirectional associations of both diseases increasing risk for each other [30,31].Interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been associated with a promoter variant in the MUC5B gene [32]. MUC5B is the predominant respiratory mucin and is elevated in concentration in muco-obstructive diseases, including COPD, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis [18]. Hypersecretion of mucin leads to relatively dehydrated and dysfunctional mucus, causing adhesion to airway surfaces and mucus accumulation in small airways that cannot be expectorated, resulting in obstruction, infection, and inflammation [19,33]. A recent large study also found the MUC5B promoter variant is a strong genetic risk factor for RA-associated ILD [34], supporting the hypothesis that the MUC5B promoter variant has downstream effects that induce muco-obstructive lung diseases. However, the MUC5B promoter variant has not been associated with RA risk, overall or by serologic status.RA also has its own set of unique genetic susceptibility factors. Polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1, collectively known as the shared epitope, have the strongest genetic risk factor for RA [35,36]. This excess risk is likely related to the function of HLA-DRβ1 in antigen presentation. Particular amino acid haplotypes in the peptide binding grooves of HLA-DRβ1 markedly affect RA risk [36]. It is hypothesized that individuals with polymorphisms that increase RA risk may be vulnerable to aberrant immune response from neoantigens that induces immune cell activation and subsequent ACPA production [37,38]. It is possible that these biologic processes may occur specifically in inflamed airways as a nidus for immune cell activation that eventually leads to RA onset. PTPN22, a gene that codes for a tyrosine phosphatase involved in T and B cell signaling, has also been implicated in RA risk [39]. The PTPN22 polymorphism is associated with a lower threshold for T and B cell activation, which may allow a wider range of reactive T cells to be recruited to inflamed airways [40]. The PTPN22 polymorphism also promotes hypercitrullination which may predispose individuals to have aberrant responses to neoepitopes formed in inflamed airways, eventually leading to the formation of ACPA locally and then systemically even years prior to articular RA onset [41-43]. This hypothesis complements the MHC class II dependent immunity that is believed to initiate ACPA formation [44]. HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22 are two of the best described genetic risk factors for RA, though there are many other genes identified that play a role in RA risk [39]. A recent genome-wide association study meta-analysis identified many other RA risk loci, many of which are targets of currently approved RA drug therapies [39]. More research is needed to understand whether there are shared genetic factors of respiratory diseases and RA.There are also environmental factors that are hypothesized to work in conjunction with genetics to increase susceptibility to autoimmune dysfunction. Smoking is the best-established lifestyle factor that increases both obstructive lung disease and RA risk. Smoking has been shown to increase the presence of citrullinated proteins in samples obtained in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) [45], which likely contributes to local production of ACPA [46]. However, ACPA elevation in BAL fluid is also present in non-smoking early RA patients, which suggests that smoking is not the only factor causing this kind of inflammation in of the pathogenesis of RA [47,48]. Other environmental factors, including non-smoking inhalants such as pollution, may also increase lung autoimmunity and affect RA risk [49,50]. Inhaled substances like silica and coal dust have been shown to activate dendritic cells and provoke an immune response through pattern-recognition cells [51]. These external substances also increase bacterial colonization in the lungs, which may modify the microbiome of the lung [51]. Changes in the microbiome may be an external factor capable of contributing to autoimmunity and associated clinical manifestations [40]. Specifically, microbiome irregularity and chronic infection are thought to serve as stimuli for autoantigen formation and subsequent ACPA production [35]. Allergens play a major role in risk of asthma and flares, and may also impact RA risk [52]. Finally, dietary intake, physical activity, and body mass index have complex contributions to many diseases including obstructive lung diseases and RA [53-56].The diverse environmental and genetic factors described above are hypothesized to induce an inflammatory response in the airways of lungs. Various studies report a mechanism whereby long-term exposure to these stimuli induces mucosal inflammation [46,57]. Local tissue inflammation caused by exogenous factors has been shown to lead to citrullination and other post-translational modifications [14], which in turn generates neoantigens [35]. A growing body of evidence suggests that citrullination and the subsequent immune intolerance forms a positive feedback loop that prompts continued autoimmune response. A study of blood samples collected from individuals before RA onset showed that epitope spreading of ACPA occurs years before clinical RA onset but no particular ACPA has been identified that initiates this process [58]. This suggests that an immune response to one citrullinated epitope leads to further responses to other citrullinated epitopes, magnifying the inflammatory response [44].Citrullination and neoantigen formation are established precursors to ACPA production [35,37]. Antigen presenting cells from the innate immune response present these neoantigens to T cells, stimulating additional T and B cells, inducing loss of immune tolerance, causing inflammation, and ultimately generating ACPA [37]. Assembly of these RA-related autoantibodies in the lungs is supported by several studies. Rangel-Moreno et al reported that lungs in patients with RA contain ectopic lymphoid aggregates of B cells in iBALT capable of binding citrullinated proteins [21]. Furthermore, studies have identified enriched ACPA levels in the BAL fluid of patients with RA [47] and the sputum of individuals at risk of developing RA, compared to the blood [59]. A Swedish study also found circulating CCP and RF to be associated with mucosal inflammation in non-RA patients with cystic fibrosis [57]. These combined findings implicate the lung tissue as a site of production for RA-related autoantibodies during either the preclinical or early phases of RA. In addition, chronic airway inflammation may induce autoimmunity from many other mechanisms, including cell turnover from reactive oxygen species, chronic hypoxia resulting in tissue damage and remodeling, and chronic infections with increased chance of molecular mimicry inducing autoimmunity and joint specificity.Other autoantibodies have been implicated in RA pathogenesis, including anti-carbamylated proteins (anti-CarP). Anti-CarP are produced when cyanate and lysine residues react to form homocitrulline [35]. Neutrophils may function as the bridge from functional innate immunity to the autoimmune response that generates these post translational protein modifications [60]. Other novel autoantibodies such as anti-peptidylarginine deiminase (anti-PAD) and anti-malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde (anti-MAA) have been associated with RA-associated ILD and research is ongoing to understand whether these may be generated in inflamed airways [61,62]. Finally, RF is the best-known RA-associated autoantibody, but its origins are still unclear. Some research suggests that RF may also be generated at inflamed mucosa, such as airways [63]. Therefore, obstructive lung disease may particularly impact risk for seropositive RA (either ACPA or RF positivity).The role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has recently gained increasing attention in investigations of the pathogenesis of many diseases, including RA [64]. NETs are used to combat pathogens during an immune system response in a process called NETosis, a type of cell death distinct from apoptosis or necrosis [65]. NETs are composed of histones, globular proteins, and chromatin which make up a fibrous complex [65,66]. NETs may be increased at mucosal sites including the lung in pre-clinical RA; an increased frequency of these complexes was found in first-degree relatives of RA who are at risk of developing RA [67,68]. NETs recruit other immune cells such as antigen-presenting cells and T cells, so they may be an important component in initial breakdown of immune tolerance loss on the path toward RA-related autoantibody production. Therefore, the formation and persistence of NETs in inflamed and damaged airways may be an integral part of the RA pathogenesis.The method by which inflammation and ACPA production transition from a local process to a systemic process predominantly affecting joints is not yet understood. ACPA presence and levels are increased in the blood of individuals years before articular involvement of RA [69]. ACPAs may be produced locally by B and plasma cells at lymphoid aggregates prior to migration through the reticuloendothelial system, where ACPAs are produced in greater abundance and enter into the peripheral circulation [40]. Epitope spread to different ACPA classes also induces systemic and articular inflammation, perhaps through molecular mimicry [44,70]. There are various complement binding methods by which ACPAs have been proposed to induce articular inflammation, including cell or antibody targeting of antigens that are present in both sites, new joint-specific inflammatory responses as epitopes spread, and the circulation of immune complexes [71,72]. However, one would expect mucosal IgA autoantibodies to emerge prior to IgG in this schematic of autoimmune triggering at mucosal inflammation. A recent study suggested circulating levels of ACPA-IgG were elevated earlier than ACPA-IgA prior to RA onset, so more work is needed to understand the timing and role of multiple mucosal sites as it related to RA pathogenesis [73].This biologic framework has formed the overarching hypothesis that obstructive lung disease may induce RA-related production and increase RA risk. Studies have investigated whether asthma, COPD, muco-obstructive lung diseases, and ILD may increase RA risk.3. Asthma and RA risk Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease with a wide range of clinical phenotypes, ranging from mild exercise- or allergy-induced bronchoconstriction with infrequent flares to recurrent, intermittent severe flares, to a more chronic form that persists throughout adulthood. Asthma has traditionally been considered an atopic, Th2 (T-helper cell 2)-mediated condition, whereas autoimmune disorders like RA are thought to be Th1 (T-helper cell 1) disorders [74,75]. However, it is hypothesized that there may be a shared susceptibility for asthma and RA [76,77]. An international genome-wide association study supports this hypothesis, finding significant overlap of asthma-association signals with autoimmune diseases [22]. Additional studies further hypothesize that asthma may cause systemic inflammatory dysfunction that manifests in regions beyond the airways [78]. Several studies have assessed the relationship between asthma and RA, many of which found an association between asthma and increased RA risk. Table 1 provides a summary of all prior studies that have investigated the relationship between asthma and RA risk. Since smoking above a threshold of 10 pack-years is associated with nearly 2-fold increased risk of RA, special attention should be made on how these studies adjust for smoking [4,79,80].Several case-control studies have found asthma to be a risk factor for RA risk. A 2018 Minnesota study found that asthma was significantly associated with increased RA risk (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.73; 95%confidence interval [CI], 1.03–2.92), adjusted for smoking status and other confounders [75]. Another large case-control study of 1,023 RA cases within a single-center biobank population also found asthma to be associated with increased RA risk (OR 1.28, 95%CI 1.04–1.58), adjusted for smoking status and other potential confounders, though mostly included prevalent RA [52]. Two case-control studies have also investigated asthma and RA risk by seropositivity. An investigation of the Agricultural Health Study found that asthma was associated with RF+ RA (OR 3.7, 95%CI, 1.3–10.5) [81], but was limited by small sample size and lack of adjustment for smoking. In a recent case-control study nested within the Nurses’ Health Studies assessing asthma and ACPA elevation prior to RA onset, Zaccardelli and colleagues found that females with asthma were nearly 4-fold more likely to be ACPA+ in blood banked years prior to RA onset [82]. Asthma was also associated with increased risk for seropositive RA from clinical laboratory results at time of diagnosis (OR 1.79, 95%CI 1.01–3.18) [82]. These results were adjusted for confounders that were collected prior to RA onset, including continuous smoking pack-years and passive smoking [82]. A cross-sectional study from Korea with rich covariate data from adjustment also suggested that asthma may be associated with RA (OR 3.12, 95%CI 2.77–3.51) [83]. These findings support the hypothesis that chronic airway inflammation may play an important role in the development of seropositive RA.Several retrospective cohort studies have also found an association between asthma and RA risk. Two similarly designed Taiwanese retrospective cohort studies utilizing national databases found asthma to be associated with increased RA risk [84,85]. Adjusting for potential confounders, Lai and colleagues found that asthma was significantly associated with incident RA (hazard ratio [HR] 1.67, 95%CI 1.32–2.62), and Hou et al reported that asthma had a HR of 1.87 (95%CI 1.54–2.26) for RA compared to individuals without asthma [84,85]. A Swedish cohort study using billing codes had similar findings, finding that hospitalized asthmatic patients were significantly more likely to develop RA than the general population (standardized incidence ratio 1.81, 95%CI 1.66–1.98) [74]. These results also suggest that asthma may increase RA risk. However, a retrospective cohort study investigating asthma and risk of RA and other inflammatory conditions using the Rochester Epidemiology Project found no significant association between asthma and RA (HR 1.30, 95%CI 0.78–2.18), but had small sample size [86].Though the majority of studies investigating asthma and RA risk have found an association, the largest study on this found an inverse association between asthma and RA risk as well as other autoimmune diseases [87]. In this study of 488,841 Israeli soldiers between 18 and 21 years of age, non-asthmatic individuals had a higher prevalence of RA than their asthmatic counterparts (relative risk [RR] 2.17, 95%CI 1.37–3.43) in the cross-sectional analysis [87]. The researchers also performed a retrospective cohort study and found that RA was also diagnosed more frequently in individuals without asthma (RR 2.21, 95%CI 1.34–3.64) compared to those with asthma [87]. These findings led to the contentious hypothesis that asthma may actually be protective against autoimmune disorders like RA, potentially through an inverse relationship between Th2 disorders and Th1 diseases [87]. However, this study did not adjust for covariates, including smoking, allowing for the possibility of confounding. Since all participants were all active soldiers and mostly men, the findings may not be generalizable to other populations. It is possible that some subtypes of asthma, or their treatments, may have different effects on RA risk. For example, childhood-onset asthma with intermittent or lack of symptoms into adulthood may impact RA risk differently than chronic refractory or adult-onset asthma. However, this is the largest study to date to investigate asthma and RA risk and is in conflict with the subsequent studies. Prospective studies with phenotypes of asthma type, severity, age of onset, and duration are needed to resolve this conflicting literature and determine whether asthma may increase or decrease RA risk.There are several limitations to consider when interpreting these results. None of the current literature was prospective and many studies had limited ability to adjust for confounders, most importantly smoking. However, it could be argued that adjusting for smoking may not be sufficient since this may be on the causal pathway between mucosal inflammation and RA risk. To help untangle this complex relationship, analyses should be performed that stratify by smoking status (never or ever), include mediation analyses, and account for smoking intensity and duration. Many of the current studies have only had smoking status at baseline so could not analyze in this way. Prospective studies carefully accounting for time-varying measures of smoking are necessary to establish a relationship between obstructive lung diseases and RA. Additionally, only two studies investigating this relationship accounted for RA serostatus, one finding an association specifically for seropositive RA [82]. It is possible that asthma may specifically affect seropositive RA risk based on the hypothesized biologic mechanisms. Since asthma is a heterogeneous condition often associated with atopy, future studies should investigate subtypes of asthma (such as age of onset, duration, severity, and other atopic conditions). Finally, only one of these investigations considered the type and severity of asthma in its analyses [75]. Simply assessing for presence versus absence of asthma may not account for the complexity of asthma and may explain the conflicting results. Accounting for subtypes of asthma may provide more insights into the relationship between Th1- and Th2-mediated pathways and the disorders they are associated with. Though there is certainly evidence to suggest that asthma is associated with increased RA risk, future studies accounting for RA serostatus, smoking, and asthma phenotypic features may allow researchers to draw stronger conclusions about the association between asthma and RA risk.4. COPD and RA risk COPD is defined by the presence of chronic, irreversible airflow limitation in the presence of risk factors and absent other etiologies of [88]. The current definition of COPD overlaps with other entities such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Heavy smoking is a well-established risk factor for COPD, but up to 25% may have relatively low smoking history or never smoked [89]. Other inhalants such as pollution and occupational exposures may also contribute to COPD risk. Patients with COPD may also experience heterogeneous disease severity, some with relatively mild shortness of breath or cough and some that progress to respiratory failure and death [90]. A small minority of patients may have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [91]. Patients may also have asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, which presents as clinical symptoms of both asthma and COPD [92]. The pathogenesis of COPD involves neutrophil and macrophage infiltration with smoking as a strong environmental factor [93]. It has been shown that there are higher levels of citrullination in COPD patient lung samples compared to patients with no airway disease [94]. Patients with COPD are also more likely to produce autoantibodies to a broad spectrum of self-antigens, which may increase susceptibility to RA [95]. Prior research has also found RA to be significantly associated with subsequent risk of developing COPD [96]. A phenome-wide association study found an association between HLA-C and autoimmune diseases and bronchiectasis, suggesting a genetic link between autoimmune disorders and obstructive lung disease [29].These findings provide rationale for investigating an association between COPD and risk of RA. However, only a few studies have investigated this relationship, summarized in Table 2. Since COPD is typically diagnosed late in life after heavy smoking exposure, studies of COPD and RA have been limited. This is likely related to insufficient sample size, given that patients with RA are usually diagnosed at younger ages. As already discussed above in the asthma section, adjustment for smoking is of particular significance.Prior case-control studies investigating COPD and RA risk have found no statistically significant association between COPD and RA. Bergström et al found that neither mild COPD nor moderate to very severe COPD was associated with RA risk [97]. This study used pulmonary function test results to identify the presence and severity of COPD prior to RA diagnosis [97]. Since there were few participants identified with COPD, power was limited to detect an association. There was a suggestion that women with COPD may have an increased risk for RA (OR 3.26, 95%CI 0.84–12.7) [97]. However, smoking was only adjusted for smoking status (current vs. noncurrent) and RA serostatus was unavailable.A case-control study in Minnesota of 221 RA cases and 218 controls also found no association between COPD and RA risk (unadjusted OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.32–1.23), but was limited by small sample size [75]. Similarly, self-reported chronic bronchitis was not associated with RA in the Agricultural Health Study (OR 0.8, 95%CI 0.3–2.2) [81]. Though these studies similarly failed to detect an association between COPD and RA risk, all had small sample sizes and typically investigated other primary exposures in their analyses. Additionally, the difficulty in adjusting for smoking and other variables make these results susceptible to confounding. As cigarette smoking may have a causal role in both COPD and RA, properly accounting for smoking in analyses presents methodologic challenges, as detailed above, and is particularly important in studying this relationship. COPD is also a heterogeneous condition so future studies should focus on subtypes of COPD based on age of onset, duration, severity, and treatment. The chronic airway damage and heavy smoking of COPD may particularly predispose to increased risk for seropositive RA, but no published studies have adequately investigated this hypothesis. In addition, no currently published studies have investigated the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome and risk for RA since this would likely require a very large sample size with long follow-up.Given this limited evidence but strong biologic rationale, larger, prospective studies are necessary to investigate the relationship between COPD and RA risk. Specifically, future studies with larger sample sizes and enhanced ability to adjust for smoking are necessary to accurately assess the way in which COPD may affect RA risk. Additionally, studies examining RA serostatus would provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between these conditions, perhaps providing insights into the potential shared etiology of COPD and RA.5. Muco-obstructive lung diseases and RA risk Bronchiectasis Bronchiectasis, characterized by abnormal widening of the airways leading to mucus buildup and subsequent risk of infection, has frequently been identified as a long-term consequence of seropositive RA [12], though the reported prevalence of bronchiectasis in RA varies widely from approximately 3–62% in the literature [98,99]. The coexistence of bronchiectasis and RA is associated with increased mortality compared to bronchiectasis alone [100], and concomitant RA and bronchiectasis or other chronic pulmonary diseases is associated with increased mortality as well as RA disease activity and severity [101,102]. Patients with RA and bronchiectasis have been shown to have higher levels of autoantibodies compared to patients with RA and no bronchiectasis, perhaps due to chronic bacterial infection [103]. As bronchiectasis can be detected both prior to or well after articular RA onset [12], it is challenging to determine whether bronchiectasis may be a risk factor for RA-related autoantibody production and RA risk or whether this is a consequence of long standing RA. Imaging evidence of pulmonary inflammation and structural airway abnormalities are common in patients with RA-specific autoantibodies in absence of classifiable RA. A study of 42 RF-positive or ACPA-positive patients without detectable inflammatory arthritis found that 14% had bronchiectasis by high-resolution chest CT imaging, with 76% having any pulmonary abnormality which included air trapping, bronchial wall thickening, and centrilobular opacities [15]. This supports the hypothesis that chronic inflammation in the lung or airways may be a site for genesis of RA-related autoimmunity. Cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem genetic disorder in which mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene result in a defect in the chloride transporter protein in the lung, pancreas, and exocrine glands [104]. The lungs are predominantly affected in patients with CF, with thickened mucus leading to airway obstruction, remodeling, and chronic infections, all of which cause chronic airway damage. NETs may play a particularly important role in the production of many autoantibodies, including ACPA and anti-carbamylated protein antibodies, in patients with CF [105]. A syndrome of CF arthropathy consisting of recurrent, episodic mono- or polyarthritis distinct from other classifiable rheumatic diseases has been described [106]. In a retrospective study of 186 patients with CF, 29% were considered to have CF arthropathy as defined by at least one episode of joint pain and/or swelling, primarily involving the hands and feet [107]. Some suggest that CF patients that receive inhaled antibiotics may develop arthralgias perhaps as an immune response from bactericidal products. Therefore, CF arthropathy and RA may have some overlapping features. A clear association between CF and increased risk of classifiable RA has not been demonstrated in the limited literature to date. However, there is evidence to support an association between CF and RA-related autoimmunity. Janssen et al compared sera of non-RA patients with CF to those of healthy controls as well as patients with periodontitis, bronchiectasis, and RA [57]. Elevated IgA anti-CCP and IgA RF were significantly associated with both CF and RA [57]. Furthermore, 33% of patients with CF arthropathy tested positive for anti-CCP, and 10% tested positive for RF [57]. There may also be genetic linkages between CF and RA; a family-based association study comprised of RA-associated bronchiectasis probands and their families found an increased frequency of CFTR gene mutations in subjects with RA-associated bronchiectasis compared to unaffected relatives as well as healthy controls [108].Chronic tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections While tuberculosis is typically viewed as a consequence of treatment of RA, patients with tuberculosis may have higher levels of ACPA than non-infected individuals, perhaps not dependent on citrullination [109,110]. Interestingly, some of these patients may not develop clinical manifestations of RA and it is thought that some patients may turn ACPA negative after treatment [109]. A link between tuberculosis and RA risk is less established. More research is needed to understand different biologic mechanisms for producing ACPA and the subsequent progression to RA.Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are organisms ubiquitous in the environment that can colonize mucosal surfaces and sometimes progress to subclinical infection or clinically-apparent disease in immunosuppressed individuals, but occasionally in patients who are otherwise healthy [111]. Chronic pulmonary NTM infection may be linked to increased RA risk, perhaps due to chronic mucosal inflammation in airways or other sites. Pulmonary NTM and RA both typically affect middle-aged or older women with underlying lung disease, particularly bronchiectasis [111]. A population-based study in Northern California found higher NTM rates among RA patients compared to similarly aged patients without RA [112]. Among users of anti-tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, patients with RA had higher NTM rates compared to patients with other inflammatory diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) using these drugs [112]. Another study investigated whether concentrations of lung microbiota in BAL fluid are different in early RA and healthy controls and found less microbial diversity in early RA, perhaps due to overgrowth of commensal pathogens such as NTM [113]. These studies provide some evidence that perhaps chronic airway infections might predispose individuals to developing RA, though patients with RA may develop these chronic infections due to altered immunity, immunosuppressive medications, or smoking.6. ILD and RA risk In patients with RA-ILD, ILD typically manifests clinically after patients have already been diagnosed with RA. Increasingly, there is evidence that OLD onset may precede the articular onset of RA, particularly in patients with RA-related seropositivity. Subtypes of ILD exist on a spectrum and can involve airways and the interstitium, which may be difficult to quantify by imaging alone without lung biopsy. A large cross-sectional study of community-dwelling adults tested RA-related autoantibodies for research purposes and also obtained cardiac computed tomography scans that were read for features of subclinical ILD [114]. This showed strong relationships between elevated RF and ACPA and subclinical ILD, suggesting autoantibody production and pulmonary inflammation are linked prior to clinical RA onset [114]. A retrospective study analyzed the predictive role of ACPA positivity in patients diagnosed with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), but who did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for RA [115]. They found that one-third of those with IIP and who were ACPA-positive developed RA within three years of their ILD diagnosis [115]. Several case reports have reported similar instances of ILD with ACPA positivity preceding the onset of RA. Two cases of patients with organizing pneumonia, which often involves the small airways, were found to be ACPA positive and subsequently developed RA within a year of their OP diagnoses [116,117]. A single-center study in Colorado described 74 patients with respiratory symptoms who were referred to a pulmonary clinic and had elevated anti-CCP without RA or other connective tissue disease [118]. They found that 54% had isolated airways diseases, 14% had isolated ILD, 26% had a mix of airway diseases and ILD, and 7% had combined pulmonary fibrosis and ILD. Usual interstitial pneumonia was the most common ILD subtype [118]. Among 33 patients with high-titer anti-CCP, only 3 developed articular RA during median follow-up of about 1 year [118]. Another study reviewed 340 patients in a single-center health system in Massachusetts with anti-CCP positivity but without diagnosed RA [119]. This study found that lung disease was the second most common indication for checking anti-CCP after arthralgias, but these patients were unlikely to progress to classifiable RA during median follow-up of 2.7 years [119]. It is possible that patients with severe enough lung disease to be detected clinically may have markedly shortened longevity and treatment with potent immunosuppressants for lung disease could mask the articular onset of RA [120]. A large population-based study in Denmark showed that only 2.2% of patients with incident RA have ILD at articular diagnosis, but 34.0% of all RA-associated ILD cases occurred within one year of articular RA onset [121]. Therefore, it is possible subclinical ILD may be relatively common in patients, even prior to the articular clinical presentation of RA. Future work is needed to determine a timeline of pulmonary inflammation and damage leading to inflammatory arthritis in RA. 6. Conclusion The current evidence supports a biologic role in airway inflammation and RA-related autoantibody production with subsequent increased risk for RA. Airway inflammation induces a local immune response and may alter proteins to form neoantigens. In addition, chronic airway damage may increase risk for infections which may cause more damage and molecular mimicry. All these mechanisms may result in increased immune activation, immune tolerance, and production of autoantibodies in local lymphoid aggregates. These processes may occur years prior to the detection of RA-related autoantibodies in the peripheral circulation and the articular symptom onset that results in a clinical diagnosis of RA.The literature is richest for investigating asthma and RA risk, with a total of 10 epidemiologic investigations identified (Table 1). Eight of these publications reported an increased risk for RA (either overall or for seropositive RA). However, the largest study to date found an inverse relationship between asthma and RA risk [87]. None of these studies were prospective, except for a case-control nested within a prospective cohort [82]. Therefore, the evidence of asthma and RA risk is currently conflicted and mostly relies on retrospective evidence.The literature is relatively sparse for other obstructive lung diseases and RA risk. Only 3 epidemiologic investigations have investigated COPD and RA risk (Table 2). All of these were underpowered to detect an association. These studies were also limited in the ability to account for smoking and none investigated COPD subtypes or RA by serologic phenotypes. The current data are therefore limited to determine whether a relationship between COPD and RA exists. The data on muco-obstructive lung diseases such as bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and tuberculosis and NTM are limited to case reports, but suggest possible increased risk for RA. Finally, some studies suggest that OLD may precede the onset of RA diagnosis, particularly in patients with seropositivity. However, these are limited to cross-sectional studies and case series and it is possible that treatment of clinically-apparent ILD may alter the natural history related to emergence of articular symptoms.7. Expert opinion Despite many improvements in the treatment of RA, patients continue to have high rates of respiratory complications that do not seem to have improved over time, even in recent years [5,10,101]. While smoking is the major environmental risk factor for RA, the prevalence of RA has not decreased even with decreasing rates of smoking [122]. Therefore, other causes of mucosal airway inflammation may be important for RA development. Determining the biologic mechanisms linking obstructive lung diseases with RA risk may offer novel targets for RA prevention as well as reduction of respiratory outcomes among patients already diagnosed with RA. Most studies have focused on airways disease and parenchymal involvement, both seeming to be associated with increased RA risk but perhaps due to different biologic mechanisms. Less research has focused on other forms of obstruction such as vocal cord dysfunction or subglottic stenosis. More epidemiologic investigations are needed to firmly establish that obstructive lung diseases are associated with RA risk. Prospective studies with the ability to phenotype asthma and COPD (both to accurately identify their presence and investigate subtypes based on clinical severity, age of onset, and duration) will be crucial to establish these patient populations as being at risk for developing RA. These studies should also have the ability to control for the possible confounding/mediating effect of smoking on possible associations. Longitudinal, repeated measures of smoking incorporating status, intensity, and duration are needed to establish these diseases as RA risk factors. The current conflicting evidence for the relationship between asthma and RA risk (as well as COPD and RA risk) should be a research priority. If these relationships are established, future studies should investigate whether treatments for obstructive lung diseases affect RA risk. Studies on prevention and screening could be considered in patients with asthma and COPD. Given current strong evidence implicating smoking as an RA risk factor, public health interventions should focus on smoking cessation for first-degree relatives and individuals with RA-related seropositivity [4]. Permanent smoking cessation has been shown to reduce risk for seropositive RA [4]. More research is also needed to understand the timing and risk related to muco-obstructive lung diseases and ILD for RA. Research should focus on identifying subclinical bronchiectasis and ILD in patients with RA-related seropositivity but no articular RA, since these patients are very likely to either develop clinical lung disease or RA.Research studies should consider advanced pulmonary imaging for research purposes, including chest computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and pulmonary function testing. Leveraging the increasing amount of molecular data in genetic, gene expression, and other -omic studies may also help elucidate mechanisms of disease susceptibility and causal pathways. Enhancing automated methods of detecting and quantifying airway and interstitial abnormalities [123] and disseminating these tools widely will increase efficiency and accuracy of studies. Patients with RA should be monitored closely for obstructive lung diseases and subclinical RA involvement, since these may be highly predictive of poor outcomes. Among patients with RA, research should focus on detection of airway and interstitial lung abnormalities to determine the natural history of lung involvement in RA and to move toward optimizing management to reduce respiratory morbidity and mortality beyond smoking cessation alone. Since progress is being made on many of these issues, the next five years in research focused on obstructive lung disease and RA risk are likely to offer important breakthroughs that may enhance the understanding of RA pathogenesis and move toward both RA prevention and reduction of the respiratory burden of RA.Acknowledgments Funding Sparks is supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (grant numbers K23 AR069688, R03 AR075886, L30 AR066953, P30 AR070253, and P30 AR072577), the Rheumatology Research Foundation K Supplement Award, and the Brigham Research Institute.

Wear particles induce a new macrophage phenotype with the potential to accelerate material corrosion within total hip replacement interfaces,"Divya Rani Bijukumar, Shruti Salunkhe, Guoxing Zheng, Mark Barba, Deborah J. Hall, Robin Pourzal, Mathew T. Mathew","Evidence that macrophages can play a role in accelerating corrosion in CoCrMo alloy in total hip replacement (THR) interfaces leads to questions regarding the underlying cellular mechanisms and immunological responses. Hence, we evaluated the role of macrophages in corrosion processes using the cell culture supernatant from different conditions and the effect of wear particles on macrophage dynamics. Monocytes were exposed to CoCrMo wear particles and their effect on macrophage differentiation was investigated by comparisons with M1 and M2 macrophage differentiation. Corrosion associated macrophages (MCA macrophages) exhibited upregulation of TNF-α, iNOS, STAT-6, and PPARG and down-regulation of CD86 and ARG, when compared to M1 and M2 macrophages. MCA cells also secreted higher levels of IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IL-12p70 than M1 macrophages and/or M2 macrophages. Our findings revealed variation in macrophage phenotype (MCA) induced by CoCrMo wear particles in generating a chemical environment that induces cell-accelerated corrosion of CoCrMo alloy at THE modular interfaces. Keywords monocytes; macrophage polarization; corrosion; CoCrMo; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS); modular junction; THR; gene expression","1.0 Introduction Total hip replacement (THR) is one of the most common and successful medical procedures 1. Yet, of the 332,000 THR procedures performed in the United States in 2017, 8.6% will require revision, according to statistics from the American Joint Replacement Registry 2. Among the main factors leading to implant failure are infection, instability, and foreign body reactions to wear debris and corrosion products from the implant 3.5. Fretting wear and corrosion within the implant’s modular taper junction are prominent causes of implant failure, as they promote the release of corrosion products and subsequent development of adverse local tissue reactions 6. Being a multifactorial process, several in vitro models have been developed to recreate the in vivo corrosion process, often described as mechanically-assisted crevice corrosion. Considering the excellent corrosion properties of CoCrMo alloy, the severity of chemically-generated damage observed at the modular interface has been surprising and poorly understood. Recent reports by Hall et al. showed cell-like features with trailing patterns at the taper interface of the modular junctions of retrieved implants 7,8, suggesting the possible involvement of cells in accelerating corrosion. Also, severe corrosion damage such as pitting, intergranular corrosion, and localized etching have been observed, which points to an aggressive chemical attack. In our previous study, we provided substantial in vitro evidence for cell-accelerated corrosion (CAC), highlighting the prominent role of macrophages in producing a corrosive chemical environment 9. Furthermore, we found that macrophages can alter the chemical environment in the presence of wear debris generated from CoCrMo alloy and compromise the corrosion properties of CoCrMo alloy. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying CAC remain unknown.As phagocytic cells located in peripheral tissues, macrophages play a diverse role in both physiological processes and pathological conditions 10. They are a heterogeneous population of cells with major functions in inflammation, infection, phagocytosis, host defense, and tissue remodeling 11–14. They respond rapidly to biomaterial implantation products in both soft and hard tissues 15. Macrophages are highly plastic and can differentiate into different phenotypic subsets 16. Depending upon various environmental stimuli, macrophages exhibit different phenotypes 17,18. Two major phenotypes are: classically-activated macrophages known as M1 macrophages and alternatively-activated macrophages known as M2 macrophages 19. M1 macrophages are immune effector cells with an acute inflammatory phenotype 20,21, which are activated following infection or injury. They are highly aggressive against bacteria and produce large quantities of cytokines 21, especially pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-12. M1 macrophages also produce high levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species 22. Conversely, M2 macrophages are immunosuppressive and assist in bone regeneration and tissue repair. They are characterized by the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, IL-1ra, C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)18, and CCL2223, as well as low levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species 19. In addition to M1 and M2 macrophages, Tatano et al. identified polarization of a novel population of macrophages (provisionally called M17 macrophages) in response to mycobacterial infection 24. These cells exhibited markedly increased IL-17 production, leading to upregulated T-helper cell 17 (Th17) polarization. These reports provide evidence of multifarious polarization capacity of monocytes/macrophages in vivo.1.1 Macrophage polarization by nanomaterials Nanoparticles are also key signaling factors, which can modulate macrophage reprogramming 25, depending on their chemistry, size, and shape. Their varying effects are primarily attributed to differences in the cellular entry mechanism adopted by different nanoparticles. M1 and M2 polarization of various nanoparticles, such as Ag,26–29 Au,30 WC-Co,31 ZnO,32–34 TiO2,35 SiO2,28,36,37 and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles 38–40, have been studied. Polarized macrophages differ from each other on the basis of receptor expression, effector function, and cytokine and chemokine production 20,41,42. The key feature of polarized macrophages is their differential cytokine production. Although the role of macrophages in corrosion of the modular junction of CoCrMo alloy in THR has been reported, their polarization at the corroded head-taper interface remains poorly understood 7,43–45. CoCrMo wear particles, which are mostly within the nanometer-range (10–100 nm in diameter), but can also reach the micrometer-scale, are the major component released during fretting corrosion at the head-neck taper interface of a modular THE implant. Actual particle chemistry can vary. The majority of particles appear to be chromium oxide, but alloy particles, chromium phosphate, and metallo-organic complexes have also been reported.46 Our group has previously established the differential response by the processed and unprocessed states of degradation products obtained from hip simulator in inducing neurodegeneration 47. Hence, it is imperative to study the differentiation of macrophages in response to the clinically relevant wear particles to improve our understanding of macrophage action at the taper interface.The aim of the current study is to provide a better understanding of macrophages and their plasticity at the THR taper interface when they encounter wear debris from CoCrMo alloy. This is a preliminary study along the path towards determining the mechanism(s) of CAC. In this study, the phenotype of wear particle–polarized (MCA) macrophages is compared to the phenotypes of M1 and M2 macrophages. In addition, an electrochemical study of metal corrosion was conducted using the cell secreted media conditions from M1, M2 and MCA. 2.0 Methods 2.1 Wear particles generationWear particles were generated from CoCrMo alloy samples using a tribocorrosion hip simulator with a pin-on-flat configuration. The samples were made of low carbon (<0.05%) wrought Co28Cr6Mo7 alloy (Carpenter Technology Ltd., PA, USA) as specified in ASTM F1537. The grain size of the alloy was 5.6 μm ± 3.6 μm (excluding twin boundaries). This alloy is typically used in orthopedics—most commonly for femoral heads of total hip replacements with a diameter of 28, 32 or 36mm. Tribocorrosion experimental conditions were developed and optimized previously by Mathew et al. (Figure 1a)48. The tribocorrosion hip simulator set-up consisted of a double-walled electrolyte chamber with a heated water bath system to maintain a constant solution temperature of 37°C. Contact between the hip head and cup was simulated through a pin-on-ball tribosystem, in which the pin (11-mm diameter, 7-mm thick) was made of CoCrMo alloy, and the ball was made of Al2O3 (28-mm diameter). The ball was placed in contact with the CoCrMo pin, which was supported by a polymeric pin holder. The pin had an exposed area of 0.95 cm2 and acted as the working electrode (WE). A graphite rod (counter electrode [CE]) and standard calomel electrode (reference electrode [RE]) were immersed in the electrolyte solution, to create a three-electrode electrochemical system. To maintain uniformity, the positions of the electrodes were kept constant inside the chamber throughout the study. A load of 16 N was applied as the ball articulated on the flat CoCrMo surface. The rotation frequency was set at 1 Hz and the amplitude was set at 30 degrees, for a total sliding duration of 750,000 cycles. A 16-N load was chosen to achieve a physiologically relevant initial Hertzian contact pressure of 480 MPa. As the purpose of this study was to generate particles under physiologically relevant conditions, the tribocorrosion tests were conducted under free potential conditions (open circuit potential [OCP] was monitored) for 750,000 cycles using an electrolyte solution based on bovine calf serum (BCS; 30 g protein/L BCS diluted with buffer contains NaCl (9g/L, Fisher Bioreagents, Cat#BP358–1), EDTA (200 mg/L, Fischer Chemical, Cat#E478–500) and Tris (27g/L, Acros chemicals Cat#167620010) at pH 7.4 and with added 100 IU/mL of penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics (Corning, Cat #MT30009CI) during the production of CoCrMo wear particles. The applied load, angle of rotation of the ball (amplitude of oscillations), and torque were monitored using LabView software (Loadstar Ltd, CA). The electrolyte solution was kept at a constant volume of 150 mL (by adding 4–5 mL of fresh solution per day to compensate for evaporation) and a constant pH of 7.6 throughout the tribocorrosion tests. The wear particles were collected after 750,000 cycles and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 minutes. The supernatant was then discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in distilled water. A particle concentration of 12mg/ml was obtained from the dry weight of 1ml of the aliquot from the stock. The original stock solution was stored at −20°C and an aliquot of stock was refrigerated at 4°C (0–4 months) until use. The endotoxin levels of the particle samples were checked prior to cell culture tests 47.2.2 Cell culture Human monocyte (THP-1) cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 (Corning, Cat#MT10041CM)) media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Cat#10082139) and 100 IU/ml of Penicillin-Streptomycin antibiotics (10,000 IU/ml, Gibco, #15140122, USA). THP-1 monocytes were treated with 5 ng/mL PMA (Sigma, P1585) for 24 h. Further, the cells were treated in three different conditions 1) M1 macrophages by incubating with, 20 ng/mL IFN-γ (R&D systems, Cat# 285-IF-100), and 10 pg/mL LPS (Sigma, #8630), 2) M2 polarization by incubating cells with 20 ng/mL IL-4 (R&D Systems, Cat#204-IL-010)), and 20 ng/mL IL-13 (R&D Systems, Cat#213-ILB-005)49 and, 3) MCA cells were generated by treating CoCr wear particles at a concentration of 1 μg/mL to M0 macrophages for a period of 24 hours (Figure 2a). The concentration of wear particles was chosen based on the dose-dependent toxicity evaluation reported in our previous studies on neuronal cells 47, monocytes, macrophages and osteoblast cells. The results from the previous study showed that the concentration of wear particles required to challenge the monocytes and macrophages with >88% viability after 24 hours was 1 μg/ml.92.3 Reactive oxygen species assay THP-1 monocytes were seeded at 100,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate and differentiated as described above. M1 and M2 cells were then incubated with fresh media for 3 hours after completion of the differentiation protocols described in section 2.2. M0 cells were treated with 1 μg/mL of wear particles for 3 hours (MCA). For comparison THP-1 cells also incubated with 3h fresh media. After incubation all the cell cultures were trypsinized and triturated to obtain a cell suspension. The suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm at room temperature for 3 minutes. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 mL fresh RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were then incubated with ROS dye (H2DCFDA, Tocris Bioscience, Cat#59–351-00) for 1 hour and then analyzed by flow cytometry using FACScalibur (BD Biosciences).2.4 Gene expression analysis RT-qPCR was used to determine gene expression to confirm expression of M1 and M2 macrophages and to characterize the expression of MCA macrophages. A total of 100,000 THP-1 monocytes were seeded in a 24-well plate, followed by the differentiation to M1 and M2 macrophages. After differentiation, cells were incubated for another 48 hours before harvesting for RNA isolation. The M0 macrophages were treated with wear particles for 24 hours to generate MCA prior to RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol method (Trizol reagent, Invitrogen, Cat # 15596026). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using a reverse transcription kit (Applied biosystems, Cat#4374966). The relative gene expression of TNF-α, iNOS 2, and CD86 for M1 macrophages and ARG, MRC, PPARG, and STAT 6 for M2 macrophages were carried out with Power Up SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Cat # A25742). GAPDH was used as the reference gene for normalization. All the pre-designed primers were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The primer sequence, gene ID and the primer efficiencies were presented in the supplementary data (Table S1). The results were quantified by evaluating the relative mRNA expression (2−dCT) normalized with GAPDH expression levels of each condition. The data is presented as mRNA expression relative to GAPDH. RT-qPCR was performed using the Applied Biosciences by Life Technologies qPCR QuantStudio ™ 7. 2.5 Cytokine bead array To better understand cytokine expression by MCA macrophages, we performed a cytokine bead array experiment. A total of 100,000 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate and differentiated as described above. The concentration of a panel of cytokines, including IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IL-12p70, was determined using the BD CBA Human Inflammatory Cytokines Kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences, Cat#BDB552932). All data were analyzed using FCAP Array V3 software (BD Biosciences).2.6 Electrochemical studies CoCrMo alloy discs with an exposed area of 0.95 cm2 were mounted onto a custom-made polysulfonate multi-well corrosion chamber (Figure 2b). CoCrMo alloy samples polished with 320-grit silicon carbide paper were connected to a single channel of an electrochemical multiplexer, which was controlled by the Grammy interface 1000E potentiostat in a three-electrode configuration. The setup included a RE (standard calomel electrode), a CE (graphite rod), and a WE (CoCrMo alloy sample). The analysis sequence was as follows: OCP-1, potentiostatic scan, OCP-2, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic polarization, and OCP3. All measurements were conducted at room temperature using different media as the electrolyte solutions: media of the respective cell cultures (105 cells) after 24-h incubation of M1 (M0 macrophages treated with M1 differentiation specific growth factors) and M2 (M0 macrophages treated with M2 differentiation specific growth factors) and MCA (M0 macrophages treated with wear particles) macrophages.OCP, EIS, and potentiodynamic polarization data were used to determine the corrosion tendency, Icorr, and corrosion kinetics. The potentiodynamic tests were performed at 0.8–1.8 V vs the standard calomel electrode (the RE), with a scan rate of 1 mV/s. The corrosion tendency and corrosion potential were derived from the potentiodynamic data. EIS tests were performed at OCP at a frequency of 100 kHz–0.01 Hz, with an amplitude of ± 10mV. A modified Randle’s circuit was used as an equivalent electrical circuit to model the EIS data, from which the resistance to polarization and capacitance were determined.2.7 Scanning electron microscopy Cell like features that were earlier observed 7 on a retrieved femoral head were further analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained from this severely corroded modular head taper made from wrought CoCrMo alloy. This component was removed from the patient for pain and instability after 2 years in situ. The taper surface was imaged using secondary electron emission with accelerating voltages of 5kV, 10kV, and 20 kV at magnifications between 250x and 4500x (JSM 6490 LV, JEOL, Peabody, MA). The taper section was sputter coated with gold/palladium (80:20) at a thickness of approximately 4 nm to prevent charging of the cell-like features and thus improving the image quality.2.8 Statistical analyses Student’s t-test was used, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered significant in all statistical tests. The samples were examined for significance by comparisons to the control samples. 3.0 Results 3.1 Macrophage differentiation Microscopic observations showed that, upon treatment with 5 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 24 hours, the human monocyte-like cells (THP-1) adhered to the surface of the culture flask and changed their morphology, becoming M0 macrophages. Upon treatment with M1 macrophage differentiating factors (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] and interferon [INF]-γ), the cells circularized and displayed M1 macrophage–like morphology. Upon treatment with M2 macrophage growth factors (IL-4 and IL-13), the cells spread out and displayed fibroblast-like morphology (Figure 2b(i)). The cells treated with wear particles also became adherent, and spread out with a different morphology closer to M1 than M2. The cells were maintained in culture for 24–48 hours before performing further experiments. The shape factor (W/L ratio) of cells at different conditions was quantified by image J software to further understand the difference in morphology. A significant difference in W/L ratio was observed in the case of M0, M1 and M2 macrophages. The MCA macrophages showed an intermediate morphology in comparison to M1 and M2 macrophages (Figure 2b(ii)).3.2 Production of reactive oxygen species by polarized macrophages Flow histograms showed live cell populations and cells expressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Figure 3). M1 macrophages exhibited higher ROS levels than THP-1 monocytes and M2. The ROS expression of MCA macrophages was observed to be intermediate between M2 and M1 macrophages after 3 hours of wear particle exposure.3.3 Relative mRNA expression profiles of polarized macrophages Upon differentiating THP-1 monocytes into M1 and M2 macrophage lineages, gene expression analysis was performed to confirm the phenotype of each lineage. Expression of CD86 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was significantly higher in M1 macrophages than in M2 macrophages (p<0.05). Even though TNF-α had a higher value in M1 compared to M2 there was no statistically significant difference in expression between them. Cells treated with M2-specific factors showed significantly higher expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), mannose receptor (MRC), and arginase (ARG) (p<0.05) than macrophages differentiated with M1-specific factors. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) expression did not differ between macrophages differentiated with M1- or M2-specific factors. These results confirmed the differentiation of monocytes into M1 and M2 macrophages (Figure 4a).MCA macrophages exhibited significantly higher expression of TNF-α and iNOS (M1 marker genes) than cells differentiated with M1- or M2-specific factors. MCA macrophages exhibited a significantly lower expression of CD86 than M1 macrophages, as well as significantly higher STAT-6 expression than both M1 and M2 macrophages. MCA macrophage expression of PPARG and MRC was comparable to PPARG and MRC expression in M2 and M1 macrophages, respectively. ARG expression was significantly lower in MCA macrophages than in M1 and M2 macrophages (Figure 4b). 3.4. Cytokine profiles of M1, M2, and MCA macrophages Standard curves were derived for concentrations ranging from 20 to 5000 pg/mL and 0 to 20 pg/mL to determine the levels of cytokines released by MCA macrophages and to compare these levels to the levels of cytokines released from M1 and M2 macrophages. IL-8 showed increased levels in both control conditions (M1 and M2 macrophages) and test conditions (MCA macrophages). Significantly higher levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were released from MCA macrophages than from both M1 and M2 macrophages. In the case of IL-10, the cytokine released from M1 and M2 macrophages was below the detection limit of 3.3pg/ml of the test kit. However, a significant increase in IL-10 was observed in MCA cells (5.66±0.97pg/ml) compared to M1 and M2 macrophages. Overall, the cytokine profile of MCA macrophages was observed to be different from the cytokine profiles of M1 and M2 macrophages (Figure 5).3.5 Corrosion rates and kinetics of CoCrMo metal exposed to M1, M2, and MCA secretory products The evolution of the open circuit potential (OCP) as a function of time showed low potential values for supernatants from M1 and MCA macrophages, when compared to the supernatant from M2 macrophages (Figure 6a). The corrosion rate (Icorr), obtained from the Tafel’s plot of cyclic polarization data, was higher with supernatant from MCA macrophages than with supernatants from M1 and M2 macrophages (Figure 6b & c). Resistance to polarization was lowest with M1 macrophage supernatant, indicating that this media produced the highest corrosion kinetics. Corrosion kinetics were higher (i.e., lower resistance value) with the supernatant from MCA macrophages than with the supernatant from M2 macrophages (Figure 6d). Little variability in capacitance was observed between supernatants from the three types of macrophages (Figure 6e). The variation in Rp and C may be attributed to the discrepancies in the goodness fit parameters of the EIS equivalent circuit. A satisfied goodness of fit below 0.001 was expected in the EIS modeling simulation, however, in the biomedical applications, many factors can influence the corrosion kinetics and subsequent data and model.4.0 Discussion 4.1 Cell-accelerated corrosion (CAC): what we knew and what we have learned The purpose of this study was to identify the cellular mechanisms leading to CAC in THE modular taper junctions by determining the phenotype, function, and differentiation of macrophages upon exposure to wear particles generated from CoCrMo alloy. Changes in macrophage dynamics provide insights into the cellular mechanisms of CAC. Previous findings from in vitro experiments suggested that amongst the periprosthetic cell populations, macrophages have a prominent impact, generating a corrosive environment. The results showed an increase in corrosion kinetics and rate of corrosion of CoCrMo alloy when exposed to media produced by macrophages challenged with wear particles. Our earlier retrieval findings demonstrated the presence of cell-like features on the head taper surface of femoral heads that were removed after several years in situ 7. The size of 10 to 20 micrometers and morphology of these cell-like features can be indicative of macrophages (Figure 7). Scanning electron microscopic images (SEM) of retrieved femoral heads have shown that a large amount of cells appeared to populate areas of the head taper surface in areas that were previously in contact with the stem taper of the femoral stem (Figure 7A, B, C), thus proving that cells can enter the crevice. Some cells even appeared to leave a trail on the metal surface (Figure 7B). A closer look at these etching trails revealed typical microstructural features of wrought CoCrMo alloy such as twin boundaries and slip bands (Figure 7D). Such features are usually only exposed by metallographic sample preparation that usually involves etching within acidic solutions. Its occurrence on a retrieved implant is remarkable, and hints to a strong chemical attack in vivo. The combination of our previous experimental and implant retrieval findings prompted us to further investigate the cellular mechanisms employed by macrophages to accelerate implant damage.Our group has previously demonstrated the physicochemical characteristics of CoCrMo wear particles generated in a hip simulator compared to processed wear particles 47. In addition, a detailed investigation on the differential response of neurons towards processed and as-synthesized particles clearly demonstrated the higher toxicity levels of as-synthesized particles from hip simulator. Moreover, it was previously reported that there is a dose dependent toxicity induced by wear particles to the neurons, monocytes, macrophages and osteoclasts 47. The current study revealed the possible ways by which wear particles generated from CoCrMo alloy can affect macrophage dynamics. Based on the results of similar studies, it has been previously speculated that cell-mediated corrosion of CoCrMo is primarily associated with the generation of ROS, which leads to Fenton-like reactions. However, Fenton-like processes are extremely complex, predominantly driven by oxidizing intermediate radicals, and sensitive to changes in chemical and biological environments 50, such as cellular secretions and the chemistry of materials at the cell-material interface. Furthermore, the lower level of ROS produced by MCA macrophages, compared to M1 macrophages (Figure 3d), did not correlate with the higher rate of corrosion (Icorr: 0.753 ± 0.04 μA/cm2, Figure 5c) with MCA macrophages, compared to M1 (Icorr: 0.052 ± 0.03 μA/cm2) and M2 (Icorr: 0.025 ± 0.001 μA/cm2) macrophages. These observations suggest that Fenton-like reactions may not be the only factor in inflammatory cell–accelerated corrosion. Thus, additional mechanism(s) must be acting at the cell-material interface to account for the unexpectedly accelerated rate of corrosion.Macrophages are a heterogeneous population of cells exhibiting different phenotypic characteristics under the influence of various stimuli 23,42,51. Resting (M0) macrophages can be reprogrammed to M1 or M2 macrophages by internalizing endogenous or exogenous materials, such as foreign pathogens (bacteria and viruses), cells, cellular debris, and other material 14,52. Reprogramming occurs through evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors that sense and recognize pathogenic factors, thereby initiating an immune response 53,54. Primary tissue macrophages do not readily expand ex vivo, so monocytic cell lines are usually used to model macrophage functions 55. Hence, for this study, we used a monocytic cell line to study the effects of CoCrMo nanoparticles on the polarization of THP-1-differentiated macrophages. Classically-activated M1 macrophages and alternatively-activated M2 macrophages were used as controls to determine the phenotype of MCA macrophages (cells differentiated through exposure to CoCrMo wear debris), which was confirmed by examining the gene expression profile of M1- and M2-specific markers (Figure 4). During these experiments, we observed increased expression of TNF-α and iNOS (M1 markers) and decreased MRC (M2 marker) expression in MCA macrophages, suggesting polarization towards the M1 phenotype. However, MCA macrophages also exhibited higher expression of STAT-6 and PPARG (M2 markers) than M2 macrophages and lower CD86 (M1 marker) expression than M1 macrophages, suggesting that MCA macrophages may have features of M2 macrophages as well. These findings contrast with those of previous studies, in which nanoparticle-mediated polarization of macrophages was towards either the M1 or M2 phenotype. Thus, based on the marker genes evaluated, our experiments (which were repeated six separate times) shows the higher probability of polarization of the wear particle induced macrophages (MCA macrophages) in comparison to M1 or M2 phenotype. Further detailed investigation on specific phenotype markers by gene transcript and surface marker analysis is required to make conclusion.Although macrophages could have different characteristics under the influence of wear particles in vitro than in vivo, our results provide insight into possible mechanisms of CAC. The site of an implant contains a mixed population of resident macrophages and macrophages recruited by the presence of wear debris. Based on the results and the observed cells at the taper interface, it can be suggested that monocytes recruited to the implant site by inflammation or resident macrophages (M0 macrophages) in the surrounding tissue can be activated by wear debris. Differentiation of monocytes or M0 macrophages occurs under these stress conditions, with the differentiated macrophages polarizing to MCA macrophages (Figure 8). It is also possible that M1 or M2 macrophages may be reprogrammed to MCA macrophages, which needs to be investigated in further detail. Yet, the differences in gene expression, ROS production, cytokine profiling, and electrochemical properties of secreted products clearly indicate that MCA macrophages are distinct from both M1 and M2 macrophages and may play a key role in CAC by altering the chemical environment within the confined space of the modular THR taper junction.4.2 Limitations and future directions One of the limitation of this study is the use of THP-1 cell lines. There can be some difference in the expression profile by the THP-1 cells in comparison to peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We acknowledge that a limited number of genes and cytokines were selected for profiling in this study. Complete profiling of macrophage pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and genes is important to provide more insight into the macrophage phenotype induced by wear particles generated from CoCrMo alloy. However, our results suggest that macrophages in the presence of CoCrMo wear particles have different phenotypic characteristics when compared to M1 and M2 macrophages. Possible signaling pathways involved in the phenotypic changes also require evaluation. As the plasticity of cells at the modular THR taper interface may vary, and the subsequent effects are poorly understood, it is imperative to understand the cell signaling pathways triggered by the presence of wear particles. Such analysis may assist in determining the exact cellular mechanisms and immunological response associated with CAC. We also would like to acknowledge that we have not analyzed the metal ion dissolution during the storage of the CoCrMo particles at 4°C. 5.0 Conclusion In conclusion, our findings describe a variation in phenotype of macrophages that could be recruited to the modular taper interface of a THR and how these cells may contribute to the corrosion process in vivo. In the presence of wear particles from the CoCrMo surface, macrophages at the site of the interface could polarize into MCA macrophages, which are newly characterized in this report. This study also confirmed that the corrosive environment created by MCA macrophages contains not only ROS but also inflammatory cytokines. Both ROS and cytokines may activate electrochemical changes at microstructure level that drive the passivation and preferential dissolution processes at the surface of the alloy, thus accelerating damage caused by corrosion.Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.Acknowledgment The authors acknowledge financial support from NIH grant R01 AR070181 and funding provided by the Blazer Foundation for the Regenerative Medicine and Disability Research Lab (RMDR) at the Department of Biomedical Sciences, UIC College of Medicine at Rockford.

Statement of Significance Fretting wear and corrosion within the implant modular taper junction are prominent causes of implant failure, as they promote the release of corrosion products and subsequent development of adverse local tissue reactions. Being a multifactorial process, several in vitro models have been developed to recreate the in vivo corrosion process, often summarized as mechanically-assisted crevice corrosion. Considering the excellent corrosion properties of CoCrMo alloy, the severity of chemically-generated damage observed at the modular interface has been surprising and poorly understood. The aim of the current study is to provide a better understanding of macrophages and their plasticity at the THR taper interface when they encounter wear debris from CoCrMo alloy. This is a preliminary study along the path towards determining the mechanism(s) of CAC.",-,"1.

"Implants for the aged patient:biological, clinical and sociological considerations","P. MARK BARTOLD, SASO IVANOVSKI & IVAN DARBY",-,"Biological considerations for dental implant treatment in elderly patients The ongoing biological success of implant therapy is based on the long-term stability of both soft- and hard-tissue integration. The main biological considerations in treating elderly patients with dental implants is the possibility of compromised wound healing following implant placement, as well as the effect of aging on the long-term integrity of osseointegration.Osseointegration is a complex process that involves a cascade of events which occur at the tissue–implant interface. These involve clot formation and the initial adsorption of serum components immediately following implant placement, an immune-inflammatory response to implant insertion, the migration and attachment of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells onto the implant surface and their proliferation and differentiation, the formation of extracellular matrix finally its mineralization and maturation. Recent Studies using a human in vivo model have shown that inflammation, skeletogenesis, angiogenesis and neurogenesis are the main biological processes involved in osseointegration (44, 68). Concurrently, I kappa B/nuclear factor kappaB, Wnt and transforming growth factor beta/morphogenetic protein signaling are prominently regulated during the osseointegration process.The physiologic process of aging itself is also highly complex at the molecular, cellular and systemic levels, and can affect the multiple aspects of wound healing associated with surgical implant placement. There are no studies that specifically investigate differences in the biologic aspects of wound healing around dental implants among patients of different ages. However, the effect of aging on the healing of other soft and hard tissues has been investigated elsewhere in the body, such as the skin and periodontium, as well as in long bone fractures. As many of the wound-healing bio-logical processes are common among different parts of the body, with similarities particularly evident in different bone-healing scenarios (9, 58, 67),we can look to this literature for insight into possible biological mechanisms that may be compromised following implant placement.In this section of our review, the effect of aging on biological mechanisms relevant to the soft- and hard-tissue wound-healing processes associated with dental implant insertion will be assessed in the context of the classically recognized stages of wound healing: (i)the inflammatory phase; (ii) new tissue formation;and (iii) maturation and remodeling. A summary of these mechanisms is presented in Table 1.Early (inflammatory) stage of wound healing The temporal soft- and hard-tissue wound-healing events following implant placement have been investigated in a dog model over a 12-week period(19, 20). In terms of soft-tissue morphogenesis of the mucosal attachment to implants, during the 4 days after transmucosal implant placement, large numbers of neutrophils have been shown to infiltrate and degrade the coagulum present between the mucosa and the implant. A dense fibrin network established a primitive seal between the wound surface of the flap and the implant. The First signs of epithelial proliferation were not observed until after 1 and 2 weeks of healing, with a barrier epithelium being established at this time.Similarly, in terms of bone formation and the establishment of osseointegration, the preparation of a recipient site for a dental implant results in blood vessel disruption and the ensuing blood clot fills the osteotomy site. Consequently, platelets are activated and release alpha granules into the fibrin-rich extracellular matrix, forming a hemostatic‘blot clot’that functions as a reservoir for signaling molecules, including chemoattractants for inflammatory cells. Neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes appear consecutively, and their fibrinolytic activity enables them to migrate into the extracellular matrix of the blood clot (19).Inflammation is the critical aspect of early wound healing, and hence it is important to note that inflammation has been shown to increase with aging (34, 43). Aging is known to promote the release of inflammatory mediators from fibroblasts(16, 77), and a prolonged inflammatory phase may delay wound healing (5). In a distraction osteogenesis model, aged mice had increased circulating serum levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and an associated 60% reduction in bone formation compared with young mice (128).The reduced bone formation in aged mice could be simulated in young mice by treatment with the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-a, and it could be reversed in old mice by the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-a signaling (128).The concept that aging affects systemic inflammation is further supported by bone fracture healing studies using aged chimeric mice produced by ablating the bone marrow with radiation and then reconstituting it with marrow from mice of different ages (134). This approach produced aged chimeric mice in which tissue progenitor cells and osteoblasts were host derived, but inflammatory cells in the callus were derived from young mice. The chimeric aged mice developed larger fracture calluses and had accelerated remodeling compared with the control aged mice, indicating that the inflammatory cells from young mice enhanced the bone-regenerative processes. How-ever, in young chimeric mice, the transplantation of inflammatory cells from aged mice did not inhibit the superior healing observed in these mice(134), suggesting that although systemic inflammation and other factors influence local stem cells,intrinsic differences in stem cell populations are an important determinant of the reduced repair that occurs with aging.New tissue formation (proliferative stage)In terms of soft-tissue healing around implants, after 2 weeks of healing,fibroblasts are the dominating cell population in the connective tissue interface, but by 4 weeks, the density of fibroblasts substantially decreases as the connective tissue begins to mature.After 6–8 weeks of healing, a mature barrier epithelium and fully organized collagen fibers are present,and a fully functional soft-tissue seal is established(20). Notably, in a gingival healing model, a significant delay in wound coverage by epithelial tissue was observed in older rats (26). In terms of bone formation to establish osseointegration, blood vessels sprout into the blood clot, forming‘granulation tissue’, and mesenchymal progenitors originating from the bone marrow enter the site, ultimately differentiation into osteoblasts. The formation of woven bone by osteoblasts results in bone formation at the implant interface (20).There are two aspects of aging that potentially affect new tissue formation during the regeneration phase of healing, namely changes in stem cell populations and changes in the microenvironment (growth factors, extracellular matrix, etc.) that alter the biological activity of progenitor cells. Adult progenitor cells are present in virtually all tissues, and their primary role is to regulate tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Stem cell functions decline with age, probably through alterations in self-renewal, differentiation potential, senescence and the arrest of proliferation(59). Depletion and/or senescence of progenitor cells are associated with age-related tissue degeneration as well as with the reduced potential for regeneration following injury (106, 109). Research in stem cell aging has more recently focused on the role of oxidative stress and impaired cellular antioxidant mechanisms,modifications in the systems that control the repair of damaged DNA, reduction of telomere length and epigenetic changes induced by histone acetylation and methylation (59). All of these events are affected by many different cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic pathways that influence not only stem cell function but also other cells present in the stem cell niche (73, 95).Mesenchymal progenitor cells are key to bone regeneration, with bone-marrow-derived stromal cells being the key population in the context of dental implant osseointegration. It has been known, for some time, that the number of mesenchymal progenitors within bone marrow decreases with age (21, 38).Furthermore, it has been reported that cell proliferation, migration and pluripotency are significantly inhibited in stem cells obtained from aged periodontal ligament tissues compared with those of young individuals (137). Similarly, it has been shown that gingival fibroblasts derived from aged donors display a reduction in cell proliferation compared with cells obtained from younger donors (26).The diminished cell proliferation described in aged cells is largely mediated through telomere shortening and the DNA damage response. The function of telomeres is to act as molecular clocks that keep record of cell replication (60). Telomere loss through multiple cell divisions results in critically short telomeres that lead to a phenomenon known as replicative senescence (27). A defining aspect of cellular senescence is the inability of cells to progress through the cell cycle. The loss of telomeres is detected as a typeof DNA damage, triggering the DNA damage response. A group of DNA damage kinases (ataxia telangiectasia mutated, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein, checkpoint kinase-1 and checkpoint kinase-2) are the main mediators of the DNA damage response, which, upon phosphorylation, activate several cell cycle proteins, including p53 (27).Phosphorylated p53 protein activates the expression of p21, which binds to and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase complexes, ultimately altering the proliferative activity of cells (49). Several markers and morphologic features characterize senescent cells, including the absence of the proliferative marker, Ki-67, an increase in senescence-associated b-galactosidase activity and the expression of tumor suppressors and cell cycle inhibitors (p16, alternative reading frame tumor suppressor, p53, p21, p15, p27 and hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein) (94).The importance of maintaining robust stem cell populations is demonstrated in mice with telomerase gene deletion (109, 110). These mice develop senescent stem cell populations and have reduced capacity for tissue maintenance and regeneration (110). Inbone, telomerase gene deletion results in accelerated aging and reduced bone mass (109).The role of aging on the cellular aspects of bone healing continues to be an active field of investigation. For example, recently the early periosteal progenitor cell response was investigated in rigidly fixed murine proximal tibial osteotomies, with a more robust periosteal response observed in young mice compared with aged mice (135). Furthermore, the rate of proliferation, expression of cyclin D1 and the amount of matrix formed were significantly elevated in young mice compared with aged mice. In a murine calvaria critical-defect model examining the role of Wnt signaling in the relative regenerative potential of bone-marrow-derived stromal cells from young and aged mice, bone marrow grafts from aged mice resulted in impaired bone healing associated with reduced b-catenin signaling, which was restored following treatment with Wnt3a (81). These various studies suggest that aging results in intrinsic differences in the population of regenerative (progenitor)cells that limits the capacity for new tissue formation,which may be reversed by the delivery of deficient molecular cues to the wound site.Cumulative oxidative stress is another factor that has been shown to induce cell senescence and apoptosis (15, 109, 111). Bone healing in the elderly may be negatively impacted by a reduced capacity to neutralize reactive oxygen species of the respiratory chain. Free radicals produced by the respiratory chain may cause oxidative damage to various cellular components that may affect cellular function by cells of the osteogenic lineage (55, 76).Aside from the effect of aging on resident tissue cells, it has been shown that it may also have a negative impact on the growth factors present in serum.Indeed, upon exposure of gingival fibroblasts to serum derived from young and middle-aged rats,superior cell migration was induced by serum from the younger animals (26). This is consistent with previous report which stated that muscle tissues from aged mice experience a rejuvenating process when they are exposed to a young circulatory system (35).In the context of the effect of aging on the local environment during bone healing, it has been shown that intramuscular implantation of demineralized bone matrix results in deposition of less calcium and lower levels of alkaline phosphatase in older rabbits (122).Furthermore, demineralized bone matrix prepared from younger animals has been reported to be more osteoinductive than preparations from older animals,indicating a possible decrease in morphogenetic proteins and other growth factors (102). Indeed, the concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 and transforming growth factor-in bone have been shown to decline with age (99, 113). The osteogenic capacity of subcutaneously implanted recombinant morphogenetic protein-2 in a rat model was also negatively affected by increasing age (88). The administration of parathyroid hormone, prostaglandin E 2 Or calcitriol(1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) was able to restore the bone-inductive activity of bone morphogenetic protein-2 in aged rats (74). Overall, these ectopic implantation studies imply that the local environment contributes to age-related changes in bone formation.Aging may affect angiogenesis at several levels,including changes in the production of, or signaling associated with, vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 (56, 123). Another Study showed that, compared with 4-week-old mice,middle-aged (6 months) and old (18 months) mice exhibit a progressive decrease in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a and of matrix metalloproteinase-9 early in fracture repair and have reduced vascularization of fracture callus and decreased bone regeneration (83). More recently, the effect of aging on angiogenesis has been shown to occur in a tissue-specific manner (115).Tissue maturation and remodeling The long-term success of implant therapy is reliant on the maintenance of a soft-tissue seal around the implant, as well as adequate bone support. Appropriate maturation of the wound, and subsequent remodeling, are essential in achieving these absolute prerequisites for clinical success, and hence an understanding of the effect of aging on tissue maturation and remodeling is important.The tissue-remodeling phase of the wound-healing process is associated with a change in the collagen composition within the wound. As the wound matures, type III collagen, which is the predominant matrix molecule found in granulation tissue, is ultimately replaced with type I collagen (57). It has been shown that expression of the collagen 1A1 gene is downregulated in the aged periodontal ligament(96). Furthermore, it has also been reported that decreased transforming growth factor-signaling,and the consequent reduced levels of connective tissue growth factor, may be responsible for the progressive loss of collagen in aged skin (100).It has been demonstrated that aging modified gingival wound healing (26). Only young fibroblasts develop actin stress fibers and incorporate a-smooth muscle actin into these structures. Aged Fibroblasts Have a reduced capacity to remodel three-dimensional collagen matrices compared with young cells(26). These results suggest that aging affects the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and collagen reorganization during wound healing, probably disturbing tissue homeostasis and function.Collagen Fibers are significantly modified and reorganized during tissue remodeling, with matrix metalloproteinase being involved in the remodeling of extracellular matrix components as newly formed tissue is reorganized during the maturation stage of gingival wound healing (101). Increased levels of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases have been identified in periodontal ligament cells from aged donors compared with young donors (17). It has been suggested that tissue remodeling and maturation develop with an increased level of proteolytic enzymes in aged subjects, which might negatively alter the mechanical properties of the newly formed tissue (119). The effect of aging on apoptosis is also worth considering because in the final stages of the wound-healing process, activated fibroblasts, macrophages and endothelial cells undergo apoptosis as an important step in the wound maturation process (42). As aging modifies apoptotic signaling (52), it has been speculated that the removal of cells from newly regenerated tissue is compromised in older individuals (119).Collagen is remodeled through phagocytosis during wound healing (6). Collagen phagocytosis is a complex process that involves the initial degradation of collagen macromolecules by matrix metalloproteinases, the binding and internalization of collagen fragments by integrins and their degradation in intracellular phagolysosomal domains (114). It has been shown that cell aging is associated with an increase in collagen phagocytosis (79, 80). Given that aged periodontal ligaments show a decrease in collagen content (96), it has been speculated that increased collagen phagocytosis may contribute to this altered phenotype.With regard to bone healing during osseointegration, immature woven bone is remodeled into lamellar bone over time, in a process recapitulating intramembranous bone formation (19). Furthermore,successful osseointegration is reliant on adequate bone support for the implant to withstand masticatory forces over time, and this stability must be considered in the context of a continually remodel bone support over time.The effect of aging on cellular and structural changes leads to an imbalance in bone remodeling(30, 76). Although not all elderly patients are osteoporotic, it is generally accepted that if we live long enough, we will become osteoporotic. Osteoporosis is the result of progressive metabolic changes, and it is generally accepted that the risk for osteoporosis increases with age (85, 107).Changes found in skin collagen also occur in bone collagen with aging and may be a causal counterpart to loss of bone quality in senile osteoporosis(116). In addition, age-related changes of noncalcified collagen in human cortical bone have been reported (132). Non Enzymatic glycation-induced crosslinks of collagen might also be a reason for the reduced biomechanical properties of aged bone, as well as influencing both remodeling and bone regeneration (132, 138).Preclinical animal trials, usually utilizing ovariectomized animals, have shown that osteoporosis can have a negative impact on osseointegration, as measured by histomorphometric outcomes, such as bone–implant contact and bone volume (45, 125).Furthermore, the use of osteogenic surface modifications has been shown to improve osseointegration in similar preclinical animal models (69). Nevertheless,although some clinical reports suggest that osteoporosis is a risk factor for implant failure (3), there is limited evidence that osteoporosis may have detrimental effects on bone healing during or following osseointegration (50), and hence it is not possible to make any firm conclusions regarding the effect of osteoporosis in dental implant therapy. Furthermore,it is unclear if any potential negative clinical effect can be overcome by the use of implants with a micro-rough (Ra: 1–2lm) surface topography (2).Clinical outcomes of implants in older patients Implant outcomes are measured by survival and success (12). The definition of these terms has changed over time. Success originally meant survival and this can make assessment of implant outcomes difficult.Currently, survival is the physical presence of the implant in the mouth, whereas success is the absence of complications. These complications may be biological, technical and, more recently, esthetic. Biological Complications include bleeding, peri-implant mucositis, peri-implantitis and inflammation from excess cement. Screw loosening, fracture or chipping of crowns or bridges and loss of retention are technical complications. Esthetic complications can be rated by both clinicians and patients, and include differing appearance from the contralateral natural tooth,recession of mucosal margin and metal of the implant showing. A summary of the clinical outcomes of aging on dental implants is presented in Table 2.Survival of implants in elderly patients Dental implants have high long-term (10 years and longer) survival rates, irrespective of system, surface and type of restoration (13, 14, 25, 32, 124, 136).Simultaneous grafting with implant placement and esthetic outcomes are similar in elderly and younger patients (12, 22, 72). Many of these studies either have not reported on the age of the subjects or elderly subjects are present in very small numbers. Both of these will mask the survival rates in patients over 65 years of age. There can be a high dropout rate among the elderly as a result of death, infirmity or serious illness that prevents them from attending review appointments (72). Interestingly, in some reports, implant surgery has been undertaken with a high average age, such as 55 years, with few postoperative issues reported (124). A regression analysis of the long-term survival of 388 Straumann TPSâimplants found that age is not significantly related to implant survival time (13). Implant placement in theelderly is not mentioned to be an issue in terms ofpoor wound healing or postoperative complications.However, the elderly that attend dental clinics forimplant surgery are likely to be healthier and moreable to look after themselves.Few recent studies have focused on elderly patientsalone. Most papers reporting outcomes in the elderlyare 15 years and older, often using machined or tita-nium plasma-sprayed surface implants, which are nolonger in use (24, 48, 53, 70, 91, 108, 112, 120, 136). Inthe short term (1–6 years), success rates in elderlypatients were at least equal to those of youngerpatients under 65 years of age (40). The Toronto stud-ies led by Zarb reported that 4.7% of implants werelost after 10 years in subjects between 65 and82 years of age (136). Data from the Branemark clinicregarding implants placed in edentulous healthyelderly patients,≥79 years of age at the time of place-ment, reported that these implants have the sameprognosis as implants in younger patients (70). Apatient’s age was not associated with increased surgi-cal complications, and geriatric patients may not bepoor surgical candidates (120).Risk factors affecting implant outcomesin elderly patientsTraditional risk factors affecting implant outcomesare medical issues, such as smoking and diabetes,previous periodontal disease, residual cement, lack of maintenance and poor oral hygiene or inability toclean (4, 104). These also apply to implants in theelderly (33). The prevalence of peri-implant mucositisranges from 19% to 65% and the prevalence of peri-implantitis ranges from 1% to 47% (4, 8, 41). Many Studies include patients over 65 years of age in their analysis and, as with survival and success, age is either not mentioned or not a statistically significant factor.From a small retrospective study of 35 geriatric patients over 70 years of age, it was reported that implant therapy in patients with controlled systemic disease (i.e. under the care of an appropriate physician, on appropriate medications and not deteriorating), should not be considered as particularly high risk (79). Interestingly, smoking is not widely reported in the literature when considering implant risk factors in the elderly. This may be a result of low numbers of smokers. Type 2 diabetes is increasing in prevalence and affects many elderly patients. Glycemic control affects peri-implant health, with poorer control related to increased bleeding and greater bone loss inpatients 59–64 years of age (51). It was suggested that control of periodontal disease is a key element in implant success. More regular recall, use of chlorhexidine mouthwashes and postoperative antibiotics may reduce the incidence of complications.Many elderly patients have serious medical issues in addition to smoking and diabetes, such as cancer and osteoporosis/osteopenia, and these can affect implant outcomes (103). Head and neck cancers are more common in elderly patients and can be treated with radiotherapy (31). Radiotherapy decreases bone vascularity and vitality, and a recent systematic review reported a significant increase in the risk of implant failure, especially in the maxilla (31).Osteoporosis and osteopenia are conditions in which bone volume and bone quality are decreased,and they are seen in postmenopausal women. These Women may be considered at risk for tooth and implant loss, although the results are inconsistent(47). After taking into account age, implant position,implant surface, years in function, diabetes, plaque,smoking, periodontitis and peri-implant bone status, Dvorak et al. (47) could find no relationship between osteoporosis and peri-implantitis. Bisphosphonates are commonly used in the management of osteoporosis and inhibit osteoclast activity by preventing bone resorption and turnover (7). This May impair osseointegration and there is a low risk of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws with implant placement. A recent meta-analysis reported on almost 1300 patients with over 4500 implants and just under one-third of those patients were taking oral bisphosphonates (7). The use of bisphosphonates did reduce the survival and success rates of dental implants. Eighty-six (6.7%)patients were reported to have developed bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws, which lasted for 16–72 months. Implant placement does carry a risk in these patients.Peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis Peri-implant mucositis is a reversible inflammation of the soft tissues around the implant, with redness,swelling and bleeding, but no bone loss. Peri-implantitis involves bone loss around an integrated fixture.The prevalence of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis varies between studies and depends on the criteria used (8). Many elderly patients are often included in these reports. However, again, age may not have been reported and the numbers are often too low to be statistically significant.The prevalence rates of mucositis and peri-implantitis have been reported to be around 31% and 37% at the patient level and 38% and 23% at the implantlevel, respectively, in a Belgian study (87). Subjects Older than 65 years of age, and those with a history of periodontitis, were more likely to experience mucositis or peri-implantitis. The association was stronger infully edentulous patients, which represents many elderly patients and often those reported in the literature. There was a correlation with rough surfaces and peri-implant disease. The prevalence of periodontitis increases with age (104) and will increase the risk of peri-implantitis. The incidence of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis can increase with increased function time in the mouth (90). Whether This is caused by the effect of ageing on the immune system and healing, or length of exposure, remains to be determined (40).Maintenance of dental implants in elderly patients Regular annual maintenance reduces the incidence of biological complications, and enrolment in a maintenance program is necessary to achieve the best survival and success rates (32, 36). This will be difficult for those in aged care or in hospitals because of infirmity or serious illness that prevents them from attending review appointments. In addition, there are few dentists that undertake treatment in these facilities (39). Plaque accumulation around implants is related to mucositis (93, 105). Implants are not always well cleaned by elderly patients as a result of impaired vision and lack of dexterity (93). Oral hygiene of elderly patients in aged-care homes can also be poor,especially if the patient is reliant on the staff to provide their oral hygiene (64, 75). A study of oral health in nursing homes has shown that fewer than one-third of residents cleaned their own teeth twice a day,but more than half cleaned their own teeth once a day (63). One-third of residents had some assistance,and those with cognitive impairment, such as dementia, required help. When assistance was required, only 30% of residents had their teeth cleaned once or twice a week. Educating the elderly is an answer, but they may have trouble with dexterity or holding the brush.Bigger brush handles or powered brushes may help.In addition, those with cognitive impairment may not remember the instructions and, irrespective of age,all oral hygiene advice needs continued reinforcement. A solution is to educate the aged-care staff, but there seems to be a lack of appropriate education and most information comes from journals, books, audio-visual media or in-house training carried out by other staff (65). One-third received no information at all.Additional barriers are no reinforcement, low priority,fear of causing pain and injury, a perception that oralcare does not provide significant benefits, issues with poor patient cooperation, too few staff and a lack of time. There may also be a high staff-turnover rate(39). The use of family members seems to have been overlooked, but they may not be interested in looking after the resident, live too far away or might not be able to afford oral hygiene products.People with implants will become increasingly common in aged-care facilities and many of the staff may not know that inhabitants have dental implants(75). It has been suggested that consideration should be given to the cleansability of implant restorations and that removable restorations should be favored for ease of cleaning. The long-term effects of poor oral hygiene on implant survival in elderly subjects remains to be determined. A study of 35 edentulous patients restored with a mix of fixed and removable full-arch restorations has reported that approximately two-thirds had poor oral hygiene and slightly fewer had moderate-to-severe inflammation (66). Those Who could provide their own daily oral hygiene had better oral hygiene and less inflammation. However,good function was maintained in the majority of the patients, and the authors recommended this choice of treatment in elderly patients. Elderly patients with implant-supported overdentures were highly satisfied with their treatment (78). The dentures were quicker and easier to clean than fixed restorations, suggesting that implant-retained dentures may be the preferred choice in the edentulous elderly rather than fixed restorations. The data for single implant-retained crowns or fixed bridges do not exist to any great extent.Peri-implant mucositis responds well to treatment.Peri-implantitis can also respond well to manage-ment. However, in a recent review it was noted that in the treatment of peri-implantitis, although many short-term outcomes are favorable, there may be a lack of disease resolution and further progression,recurrence of the disease and implant loss (61). It has been suggested that where there are biological complications, the superstructure or denture attachment could be removed and the implant buried (126).In summary, treatment of patients over 65 years of age with implants can be considered safe and predictable. Patients’age per se does not appear to present a risk factor in implant survival and success.However, poor general health can reduce implant outcomes. Poor oral hygiene is an issue in the elderly and is related to peri-implant inflammation. Regular Maintenance appointments are important, but are difficult for many elderly subjects to attend because of infirmity or serious illness.Sociological considerations of implants for aged patients Social considerations of dental implant treatment for aged patients should not differ considerably from those for any patient. It is recognized that provision of dental implants is complex and requires good communication with the patient to minimize misunderstandings with regard to treatment outcomes,complications and commitment to ongoing care. A Summary of sociological considerations for dental implants in aged patients is presented in Table 3.Changing demographics The prevalence of edentulism has been monitored for decades in many countries, with most developed countries demonstrating a substantial decline in edentulism in recent times (37, 63, 92, 117, 121, 133).Even though there is a clear decline in the number of missing teeth in older patients, it is predicted that there will continue to be a need for replacement treatments well into the future (54). These declining rates of edentulism and increasing numbers of natural teeth in the aging population have been described as dentistry achieving an adverse‘consequence of success’(71). Thus, as more teeth are retained into older age, more teeth become at risk of developing dental caries and periodontal diseases. Asa consequence, there is now a trend toward older people with more teeth having greater requirements for dental care, and this is leading to an increased burden on the health system.The impact of missing teeth, as a result of issues with appearance and function, is reported to affect,most commonly, psychological and social well-being(89). Historically, missing teeth have been replaced with dentures, but currently, many people regard dentures poorly and find the thought of wearing dentures disturbing (62). With the advent of implant-supported or retained dental prostheses has come a significant change in treatment strategies for edentulous patients. Perhaps the two most significant advances in this field have been the ability to provide improved stability for complete denture wearers and,for the partially edentulous, improved esthetics and function (1).Satisfaction and expectations of fully edentulous patients for implant-retained/supported dentures Many studies have reported that the general satisfaction rate of edentulous patients for complete dentures ranges between 65% and 90% (18, 29).Nonetheless, there are individuals who, for a variety of reasons, are unable to adapt to or tolerate full dentures. Unfortunately, our ability to predict who these patients will be is very unreliable (28).Although various soft- and hard-tissue augmentation procedures have been developed to provide a better foundation for complete dentures, they don't always improve the patient's’ability to control and manage their dentures in a comfortable and functional way. However, implant-retained dentures have improved these adverse outcomes and in doing so have improved the quality of life for those patients who cannot tolerate complete dentures.More recently, a systematic review concluded that implant-supported dentures resulted in high patient satisfaction with regard to denture comfort,improved chewing efficiency and increased maximum bite force; however, an improvement in general quality of life was not always noted (23).Satisfaction and expectations of partially edentulous patients for implant treatment Once all teeth have been lost, the only replacement option is full dentures. Whether these will be implant retained or not will depend on functional,financial and clinical parameters. Even though the incidence of full edentulousness is declining, the fact remains that there is still a significant proportion of the aging population who will have a need (and demand) for complete denture services.The issues facing partially edentulous individuals differ from those facing fully edentulous patients. For Individuals with missing teeth, the issues confronting them are largely related to esthetics and function.Whilst many people with missing teeth replace them with removable partial dentures, this option is becoming less acceptable, even in the aging population. A recent study investigating the motivation and expectations of partially edentulous patients seeking an implant solution found that an overriding driving force to seek such treatment was to return to‘normality’. That is, they sought implant treatment as a means to return their quality of life to a normal status(54). Following treatment, a common finding was that the subjects considered that the replaced teeth felt like natural teeth and had restored their lost function and/or esthetics. As a result of the limited sample size it was concluded that further studies were needed to determine the expectations of patients over a broad range of ages and socioeconomic backgrounds to enable a better understanding of patients’attitudes and beliefs toward implants before undertaking such treatment.Economic issues Apart from the clinical judgment and technical competence of the clinician providing implant treatment,patients should be presented with enough information to understand the costs, benefits and potential complications of such treatment. Many of these are difficult to quantify and interpret, but they are of considerable importance to aged patients. One of the most significant of these issues for patients financial constraint, which can preclude many from undertaking such treatment. However, interestingly,a study that removed this obstacle and offered mandibular overdenture implant treatment at no cost, reported that 36% of the participants did not accept the offer (129). Those who refused treatment cited fear of implant surgery and satisfaction with their current complete dentures as reasons for their decision. From this it would seem that cost is not always an overriding issue in the decision-making process of whether to proceed with implant-related treatment.Nonetheless, dental implant treatment is generally considered by most patients to be an expensive treatment option. In this context, it must be noted that implants are often placed where more conservative,simpler, faster and less-costly traditional techniques,involving far less risk, would benefit patients to a far greater degree (10). Thus, although other, less-expensive treatment options to implants exist, the esthetic,functional and emotional benefits gained from dental implant treatment can be significant, albeit difficult to measure.The Financial aspect of implant treatment is often overlooked in reviews considering implant treatment,with the major focus being on site assessment,patient fitness for treatment and a willingness and ability to undergo the required surgical and restorative procedures. However, another very important aspect to patient management and successful treatment outcomes is consideration of the future com-fort, as well as functional and esthetic benefits in relation to the associated treatment costs. Clearly,any implant treatment plan needs to take into account the costs of not only the initial capital outlay(involving professional fees, laboratory fees and implant component costs), but also future maintenance and repair costs, and any other potential hidden costs of the service (82, 84, 86, 97). Thus, a patient needs sufficient information to be able to evaluate the cost/benefit of the proposed treatment. This should include an appraisal of the financial obligations, time commitment, opportunity for improved quality of life, discomfort and inconvenience, and long-term maintenance costs. These Must be considered, both individually and collectively, before commencement of treatment. If the patient perceives that the costs involved outweigh the expected value and outcomes of the treatment, they are likely to question whether to proceed. On the other hand, if they believe that the costs are justified,then treatment is likely to proceed and they are more likely to appreciate the treatment provided (131).To date, few studies have evaluated the cost/benefit or health economic outcomes of dental implant treatments. Most have considered single tooth implant replacement vs. the traditional three-unit fixed dental prosthesis and almost none have considered such issues in aged or aging patients. Typical Findings are that single tooth replacement with an implant is a cost-effective treatment compared with the traditional fixed bridge, and that for the replacement of multiple teeth, dental implants are associated with higher costs, but better health outcomes, thanother traditional (fixed or removable) forms of multiple tooth replacement (127, 139).Initial studies investigating cost–benefit outcomes of implant treatments have used visual analog scales and patient satisfaction questionnaires (130). In addition to these it has been suggested that quality-of-lifebenefits should also be considered (46). Initial studies investigating how implants impact on quality of life used various forms of the Oral Health Impact Profile(118). Recently, such instruments have been refined and the‘Quality of Life with Implant-Prostheses’questionnaire for assessing the impact of cemented implant prostheses on oral health-related quality of life has been developed (98). This new questionnaire allows patient satisfaction, patient well-being and patient quality of life to be assessed.This type of approach has been extended, in which patient preference for implant treatments, before and after treatment, is recorded using visual analog scales(139). This was followed with some further sophisticated modeling including quality-adjusted tooth years (an assessment of the type of restoration and its effect on adjacent teeth) and then, by using a stochastic cost-effectiveness model, the expected costs and quality-adjusted tooth years were analyzed. From These analyses it was concluded that while both implant-supported single crowns and fixed dental prostheses resulted in good long-term clinical results,from the patients’perspective, the lower costs associated with the single tooth implant option resulted in this treatment being preferred over the traditional fixed dental prosthesis option.Most recently, a systematic review attempting to determine the degree to which the cost of prosthodontics care is considered in relation to good clinical outcomes concluded that measures of cost benefit, cost-effectiveness and cost utility are commonly used to address these issues (11). However it was noted that such measures are difficult to carry out and that further collaboration with experts in health economics is needed to understand these complex interrelationships better.",-,"1.

Dental implants in the elderly population: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Murali Srinivasan Simon Meyer Andrea Mombelli Frauke Muller,"Keywords: aged 65 years and over, dental implants, edentulous jaws, elderly patients, implant survival, meta-analysis, survival rate, systematic review. Objective: This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the outcome of dental implant therapy in elderly patients (≥65 years). Material and Methods: Online database and hand searches were systematically performed to identify studies reporting on dental implants placed in the partially/completely edentulous jaws of elderly patients. Only prospective studies reporting on regular-diameter (≥3 mm), micro-rough surface implants were included in this review. Two investigators performed the search and data extraction. An inter-investigator reliability was verified using kappa statistics (j). A meta-analysis was performed on implant survival rates, while the mean peri-implant marginal bone level changes (PI-MBL), technical/mechanical complications, and biological complications were reported descriptively. Results: The systematic search yielded 2221 publications, of which 11 studies were included for statistical analyses. The calculated for the various parameters extracted was j=0.818–1.000. Meta-analysis was performed on the post-loading implant survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years.The random-effects model revealed an overall 1-year implant survival of 97.7% (95% CI: 95.8, 98.8;I2=0.00%,P=0.968;n=11 studies). The model further revealed an overall implant survival of 96.3% (95% CI: 92.8, 98.1;I2=0.00%,P=0.618;n=6 studies), 96.2% (95% CI: 93.0, 97.9;I2=0.00%,P=0.850;n=7 studies), and 91.2% (95% CI: 83.4, 95.6;I2=0.00%,P=0.381;n3 studies) for 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The reported 1-year average PI-MBL ranged between 0.1 and 0.3 mm, while the reported 5- and 10-year PI-MBL were 0.7 and 1.5 mm, respectively. Information obtained pertaining to the technical and biological complications in the included studies was inadequate for statistical analysis. The frequent technical/mechanical complications reported were abutment screw loosening, fracture of the overdenture prostheses, activation ofretentive clips, ceramic chipping, and fractures. The common biological complication reported included peri-implant mucositis, mucosal enlargement, bone loss, pain, and implant loss. Conclusions: This review provides robust evidence favoring dental implant therapy in elderly patients as a predictable long-term treatment option, in terms of implant survival, clinically acceptable PI-MBL changes, and minimal complications. Therefore, age alone should not be a limiting factor for dental implant therapy.","Global demographic trends project a world population of nine billion people by the year 2050, which is an estimated increase of 50 million annually. This trend is not just because of an increase in the birth rate but due to a multitude of other factors such as increased life expectancy, reduction in mortality, slow growth, and urbanization. It Is estimated that in the United States alone,the elderly population (>65 years) will double by the year 2050 (Ortman et al. 2014).Although the decline in the rates of edentulism in developed countries has been reported (Mojon et al. 2004; Muller et al.2007), it will however not be eradicated;tooth loss will gradually appear at a later age and in an older segment. The elderly segment will inevitably start requiring complex and quality rehabilitation procedures including, but not restricted to, dental implant therapy.Rehabilitation with dental implants is a highly successful therapeutic option for the partially/completely edentulous jaws, with predictable and long-term success rates(Chappuis et al. 2013). In fact, a mandibular two-implant overdenture therapy is considered a first-choice standard of care in the rehabilitation of completely edentulous patients (Feine et al. 2002; Thomason et al.2009). Implant-supported prostheses have proven to improve mastication (van Kampen Et al. 2004) and the associated oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) (Emami Et al. 2009). In the very old dependent edentulous patients, implant overdentures (IODs)have shown to increase the maximum voluntary bite force and the masseter muscle thickness, thus signifying a benefit of IODseven in later life (Muller et al. 2013). In the past, implant therapy has been mostly used in a younger adult segment, but current demographic trends suggest that the candidates for implant therapy, at the present and in the future, would primarily be in the older strata. This older segment would inevitably be the patient pool for routine and complex implant rehabilitation procedures.Yet, in the literature, scientific evidence is lacking pertaining to implant therapy in the elderly population. Few studies existing in the literature were purposefully designed for the geriatric age group undergoing dental implant therapy (Muller et al. 2013; Becker Et al. 2015; Hoeksema et al. 2015). However,most published studies including elderly participants do also comprise of younger adults within the same study groups, hence deeming it impossible to ascertain a true treatment effect exclusive to the elderly patient segment. Little is known on the long-term influence of age on dental implant therapy,in the old and the very old patients. Information related to the effects like implant survival, complications (technical/mechanical or biological), and prosthodontic maintenance needs and patient satisfaction(subjective and objective) in the elderly population is scarce or inexistent.Hence, the dedicated aim of this system-atic review was to evaluate the outcome of dental implant therapy in the elderly population aged 65 years or over. The null hypothesis set for this review was that in the elderly population undergoing dental implant therapy, there is no difference in the post-loading implant survival rates between the partially and completely edentulous jaws. The population intervention/exposure comparison outcome (PICO) focus question set for this systematic review was: “In the elderly geriatric patients, what are the survival-, technical complication-,and biological complication- rates when comparing dental implant therapy between the partially and completely edentulous jaws?”Material and methods Protocol and registration This systematic review was performed and reported as prescribed by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al.2010). The protocol followed in this systematic review is similar to the design used in previously published systematic reviews(Schimmel et al. 2014; Srinivasan et al.2016).Eligibility criteria The predefined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria for this systematic review are enumerated in Table 1.Information sources All prospectively designed human studies reporting on dental implant therapy in the elderly population (≥65 years) were searched in online electronic databases (PubMed,Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science). Relevant publications which were not accessible online were hand-searched. Other sources such as online search engines (Google, Yahoo,etc.), online research community websites(https://www.researchgate.net/),reference cross-checks, and personal contacts with authors were all accessed for generating maximum pool of relevant studies. No further search was performed after the last executed update, which was on January 14, 2016.Search strategy The search strategy was designed and set up by experts in database searches (FM and AM)and the two investigators (MS and SM). The Two investigators performed the searches based on the identified medical subject headings (MeSH) search terms as dictated by the research design and strategy. The terms were then applied using the appropriate Booleanoperators, “OR” or “AND,” to perform the search in the databases. The complete set of search terms used, and the filters set, while performing the searches in the above-mentioned databases are described in Table 1.Study selection No restrictions were applied relating to the type of studies included, which included all studies with a prospective design (randomized controlled trials [RCTs], prospective cohort studies, prospective case–control studies, and prospective case series). The investigators (MS and SM) initially swept through the search results by a thorough title and abstract screening. After the initial sweep,the shortlisted studies were included for a full-text analysis only after a mutual agreement between the two investigators. Dis-agreements, if present, were resolved by consensus meeting with the senior authors(AM and FM). The final list was mutually agreed upon by the two investigators before data extraction. If multiple publications reporting on the same cohort from the same author existed, then only the most recent publication was included in the review.Data collection process Data extraction was performed independently and was reciprocally blinded. Both investigators (MS and SM) used MicrosoftâExcelspreadsheets (Microsoft Excel 2016 for Macintosh/Windows, version 16.0, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) for tabulating the extracted information. When indoubt, concerning the extracted data, the corresponding authors were contacted by email for confirmation.Data items The following parameters were extracted from the included studies: authors’ names, year of publication, study design, loading protocol,implant system, observation period, number of patients included in the study, mean age,number of implants placed, survived, and failed, number of patient and implant drop-outs, dental state of the jaw rehabilitated (partially or completely edentulous), the type of prosthetic rehabilitation (fixed or removable prostheses), mean peri-implant marginal bone level changes (PI-MBL), biological complications, technical/mechanical complications,and the reported implant survival rates.Missing data Missing relevant information from the included studies was procured by a direct email contact with the corresponding author. Email Reminders were sent to the authors in case of nonresponse. Further emails were sent if the received information required further clarity. Anon Response from the author would ultimately lead to the exclusion of the study, when necessary information was lacking.Risk of bias and quality assessment of the included studies Risk of bias was assessed in the included RCTs using the Cochrane Collaboration’stool (Higgins et al. 2011), while the Newcastle–Ottawa Scales (NOS) were used for prospective cohort and case–control studies(Wells et al. 2014). Summary measures The primary outcome measure set for this review was the implant survival rate, as seen previously published reviews (Schimmel Et al. 2014; Srinivasan et al. 2014, 2016). This Review adopted the criteria for defining implant survival/success proposed by Bus And coworkers (Buser et al. 1990). The loading protocols defined in this review are as described in a previous review (Esposito et al.2007). Secondary outcome measures included the mean PI-MBL, biological, and technical/mechanical complications.Synthesis of resultsAn inter-investigator reliability was assessed using kappa (j) statistics. The meta-analysis was performed for the included studies on the post-loading implant survival rates at 1, 3, 5,and 10 years. Confidence intervals were set to95% (95% CI), and implant survival rates (SR%) were calculated for each study using the comprehensive meta-analysis software, version 3.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA). A random-effects model was used to calculate the weighted means across the studies (DerSimonian & Laird 1986).I-squared statistics(I2-statistics) was used to assess the heterogeneity across the included studies.Risk of publication bias and additional analyses risk of publication bias was assessed across the studies using a funnel plot (Sterne & Egger 2001). A sensitivity analysis was carried out wherein the implant survival rate was calculated considering the dropout implants as failures (Srinivasan et al. 2016).Additional descriptive analysis was performed to report the PI-MBL and biological and technical/mechanical complications. Results Study selection The details of the search and selection processes are described in the PRISMA flow diagram (Moher et al. 2010; Fig. 1). The Systematic database search yielded a total of 2221 eligible studies (PubMed=1115;Embase=394; CENTRAL=58; Web of Science=654). From this total, 1850 studies were eliminated after an initial title and abstract screening, thus identifying a total of 371 studies for full-text analysis; 157 studies were shortlisted for inclusion in the review.However, most studies did not have a true elderly cohort and the intervention groups in the studies also consisted of patients who are below 65 years. Hence, 157 emails were sent to the corresponding authors, requesting them for details pertaining only to the elderly population (65 years and above). After receiving the responses from the authors, reference cross-checks and hand searches were performed; 18 studies were shortlisted for a final evaluation. To carefully avoid publication bias, many studies were excluded because they reported on the same cohort from different time points. The various reasons for exclusion of the studies during the various stages of the systematic search process are shown in Fig. 1. A reapplication of the inclusion and exclusion criteria was performed to this final list resulting in a further elimination of seven studies, because six of these publications had a sample size of less than 10 elderly patients and one was a double publication (Glauser et al. 2005, 2007; Crespi Et al. 2008, 2014; Schropp & Isidor 2008;Degidi et al. 2010; Grandi et al. 2014).Finally, a total of 11 methodologically sound publications were included in this review for statistical analyses (Ormianer & Palti 2006;Strietzel & Reichert 2007; Laviv et al. 2010;Cakarer et al. 2011; Covani et al. 2012; deCarvalho et al. 2013; Muller et al. 2013; Bres-san & Lops 2014; Becker et al. 2015; Hoeksema et al. 2015; Rossi et al. 2015).Study characteristics The included list of publications for analyses comprised of two RCTs (Muller et al. 2013;Rossi et al. 2015), one prospective cohort study (Covani et al. 2012), one prospective case–control study (Laviv et al. 2010), one prospective comparative study (Hoeksema Et al. 2015), and six prospective case series(Ormianer & Palti 2006; Strietzel & Reichert 2007; Cakarer et al. 2011; de Carvalho et al.2013; Bressan & Lops 2014; Becker et al.2015). All of the 11 included studies could be analyzed for a 1-year post-loading implant survival, while six of them could be analyzed for a 3-year post-loading implant survival(Ormianer & Palti 2006; Strietzel & Reichert 2007; Laviv et al. 2010; Covani et al. 2012;de Carvalho et al. 2013; Rossi et al. 2015).Seven studies provided data enabling a 7-year post-loading implant survival (Ormianer & Palti 2006; Strietzel & Reichert 2007; Lavis Et al. 2010; Covani et al. 2012; de Carvalho Et al. 2013; Hoeksema et al. 2015; Rossi et al.2015) analysis. From the list of 11 studies,only three studies could be analyzed for a 10-year observation period (Covani et al. 2012;de Carvalho et al. 2013; Hoeksema et al.2015).Four studies reported on the rehabilitation of the completely edentulous jaw with implant-supported fixed (ISFP) or implant-supported removable prostheses (ISRP)(Cakarer et al. 2011; Muller et al. 2013; Bres-san & Lops 2014; Hoeksema et al. 2015), four reported on partially edentulous jaws with ISFP (Laviv et al. 2010; Covani et al. 2012; deCarvalho et al. 2013; Rossi et al. 2015), two reported on rehabilitations in both the partially and completely edentulous jaws (Ormi-aner & Palti 2006; Strietzel & Reichert 2007),and in one study, neither the jaw type northe type of rehabilitation was specified(Becker et al. 2015).Information pertaining to the PI-MBL was available in only two of the included studies(Becker et al. 2015; Hoeksema et al. 2015);biological and technical/mechanical complications were reported in nine studies (Ormi-aner & Palti 2006; Strietzel & Reichert 2007;Laviv et al. 2010; Cakarer et al. 2011; Covaniet al. 2012; de Carvalho et al. 2013; Bressan V Lopez 2014; Hoeksema et al. 2015; Rossi Et al. 2015). All the information extracted from the published articles and from email correspondences is presented in Tables 2 and 3.Risk of bias/quality assessment of the included studies The RCTs, cohort studies, and case–control studies included in this review could only be considered as prospective case series. Therefore, neither the Cochrane tool nor the NOScould be applied to assess the risk of bias and quality of the studies.Synthesis of result Inter-investigator agreement The overall scores calculated for the various parameters extracted by the two investigators ranged between 0.818 and 1.000, hence indicating an excellent degree of inter-investigator agreement. Meta-analysis of the included studies A meta-analysis was performed on the post-loading implant survival rates at various time points (1, 3, 5, and 10 years). The random-effects model revealed an overall 1-year post-loading implant survival of 97.7% (95% CI:95.8, 98.8;I2=0.00%,P=0.968;n=11 studies; Fig. 2). Six studies provided data for a 3-year analysis, and the model revealed an overall post-loading implant survival of 96.3% (95% CI: 92.8, 98.1;I2=0.00%,P=0.618;n=6 studies), and is shown in Fig. 3. Five-year post-loading implant survival was found to be 96.2% (95% CI: 93.0, 97.9;I2=0.00%,P=0.850;n=7 studies; Fig. 4),while the 10-year survival was found to be91.2% (95% CI: 83.4, 95.6;I2=0.00%,P=0.381;n=3 studies) as revealed in the forest plot (Fig. 5).Descriptive analysis of the mean PI-MBL changes,biological and technical/mechanical complications The reported 1-year mean PI-MOBILE range between 0.1 and 0.3 mm (Becker et al. 2015;Hoeksema et al. 2015), while the reported 5-and 10-year PI-MBL were 0.7 and 1.5 mm,respectively (Hoeksema et al. 2015).Information obtained pertaining to the technical/mechanical and biological complications in the included studies was inadequate for statistical analysis and is reported descriptively in Table 3. The frequent technical/mechanical complications reported were abutment screw loosening (n=1), fracture of the overdenture prosthesis (n=1), activation of reten-tive clips (n=1), ceramic chipping (n=3), and ceramic fractures (n=2). The common biological implication frequently encountered included peri-implant mucositis (n=2),mucosal enlargement (n=1), bone loss(n=7), pain (n=1), and implant loss (n=2).Additional analyses Sensitivity analyses were performed for implant survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years while considering dropout implants as failures. The sensitivity analyses revealed a reduction in the 1-year implant survival rate dropping down to 95.6% (95% CI: 92.1, 97.5;I2=29.49%,P=0.165;n=11 studies;Fig. 6), while the 3-year survival rate dropped down to 91.7% (95% CI: 87.6, 94.5;I2=0.00%,P=0.465;n=6 studies; Fig. 7).The 5-year implant survival reduced to91.2% (95% CI: 87.4, 94.0;I2=0.00%,P=0.656;n=7 studies; Fig. 8), and the 10-year implant survival was 80.5% (95% CI:45.5, 95.3;I2=88.11%,P=0.000;n=9 stud-ies; Fig. 9). A funnel plot was used to rule out any publication bias (Fig. 10).Discussion The protocol followed in this systematic review was in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by PRISMA, and the review was conducted in a manner similar to previously published reviews (Schimmel et al. 2014;Srinivasan et al. 2016). Although the method-ology executed can be considered robust, afew limitations may have existed. This study delivers a meta-analysis of prospectively designed studies that included two RCTs,one cohort study, one comparative study, and six prospective case series. However, the included RCTs and cohort studies could not be considered as such, because their tested interventions and study objectives did not conform to our focus question. Therefore,they were recruited as prospective case series,solely, for the purpose of this review. How-ever, in terms of strength, the included studies were methodologically of superior quality conducted by well-known and senior researchers. Meta-analysis of RCTs is often graded the highest level of scientific evidence(Glenny et al. 2008). This review was unable to identify RCTs with similar objectives asour framed PICO question, because there were none. Hence, the conclusions drawn from the results of this meta-analysis,although credible, should be cautiously interpreted. Furthermore, our deliberate exclusion of retrospective studies could have influenced the number of studies included, but this was deemed necessary so that only studies with low bias and high methodological quality would be included in this review (Schimmel Et al. 2014; Srinivasan et al. 2016).During the search and identification process, we found that numerous studies reporting on dental implant therapy had an elderly cohort, but within the cohort group there also existed participants below the age of 65 years. The inclusion criteria for this review required a minimum age of 65 years and over; hence, it was necessary to either eliminate those studies from the review or request the respective corresponding authors for raw data pertaining to participants aged 65 years and over. Therefore, email requests were sent to the corresponding authors requesting for unpublished raw data from their studies pertaining to the elderly cohort.This unusual approach requested additional sub-analyses from the authors, and at this point we would like to acknowledge the willingness of some authors to invest time and effort to help with this review. Still, after contact with the authors, many studies were further excluded because of either sample size of less than 10 elderly participants, nonresponse, or implant surface, etc. Only Two of our included studies were exclusively on the geriatric population and had participants aged over 65 years (Muller et al. 2013;Becker et al. 2015). For all the other included studies, authors had to be contacted for details. From the 11 finally retained studies,nine were based on these additional analyses,without which this review would have not been possible. The study published by Becker Et al. (2015) provided 7-year outcomes of dental implant therapy in the elderly population(Becker et al. 2015). However, the implant pool in this study also consisted of machined implants. The exact time point of dropouts of these machined surface implants was not available; hence, the review only considered the 1-year outcomes from this study, as it was possible to precisely exclude the machined surface implant number for this period.The results of the meta-analysis revealed a pooled overall 1-year post-loading implant survival of 97.7%, while the overall 3- and 5-year implant survival rates were calculated as96.3% and 96.2%, respectively; and a 10-year implant survival rate of 91.2%. These Implant survival rates in the elderly population are comparable to the survival rates published in the literature (Kowar et al. 2014). A Recently published retrospective study reported for an elderly cohort (aged 65–89 years) an implant-based survival rate of 95.39% over an observation period of up to 17 years (Park et al. 2016). Becker et al.(2015) reported an implant survival rate of 94.6% in the elderly population (aged 66–93 years) in an observation period of 7 years (Becker et al. 2015).In the 11 included studies, four studies reported on completely edentulous jaws(Cakarer et al. 2011; Muller et al. 2013; Bres-san & Lops 2014; Hoeksema et al. 2015) and four reported on partially edentulous jaws impairment, they will increasingly depend on help from carers for the activities of daily living. Unfortunately, the nursing staff is often not well trained for the handling of implant dentures and the corresponding oral hygiene gestures. Hence, the success criteria for implants independent elders have to be revisited (Muller & Schimmel 2016). Giventhe preceding aspects, a close monitoring ofelderly implant patients is recommended tomonitor their performance and reduce thedegree of technical complexity along withfunctional decline and morbidity.ConclusionThis systematic review provides robust evi-dence favoring dental implant therapy inelderly edentulous patients as a predictablelong-term treatment option in terms of highimplant survival rates, clinically acceptablePI-MBL changes, and minimal complications.Therefore, age alone need not be considered afactor in effectuating dental implant therapy,and implants should be a recommended treat-ment option in the rehabilitation of elderlyedentulous patients in order to help improvetheir oral function and quality of life.Acknowledgements:The authorswish to thank the following correspondingauthors of the included publications for theirtimely responses and valuable cooperation forthe successful completion of this systematicreview: Antonio Barone, Breno CarnevalliFranco de Carvalho, Eriberto Bressan, FabioRossi, Frank Strietzel, Henny J.

Revised Success Criteria: A Vision to Meet Frailty and Dependency in Implant Patients,"Frauke Müller, Prof Dr Med Dent, Martin Schimmel, Prof Dr Med Dent",-,"Long-term predictability of endosseous implants appears to have exceeded the initial expectations of early implant proponents. Today, we see patients with successful implants that were placed some 30 or more years ago. In contrast to the environment where they have been placed, these implants will not change. Hence, in response to the aging of the population, a paradigm shift in long-term management of dental implants should be considered.Physiologic aging normally creates deterioration of vision, tactile sensitivity, and dexterity, rendering denture management and oral hygiene difficult. In addition, age often goes hand in hand with frailty and multimorbidity, potentially leading to dependency in the activities of daily living and a shift in priorities in a person’s life. Over the years, ongoing tooth loss may occur, requiring a new restorative treatment concept. While it is well established that age alone is not a contraindication for successful implant therapy, do we sufficiently consider what aging implies in our treatment planning? The success criteria for implants as defined by Albrektsson et al1 and Buser et al2 are widely cited and generally accepted. These criteria describe the absence of persistent subjective complaints, such as pain, foreign body sensation, and/or dysesthesia; absence of recurrent peri-implant infection with suppuration, of mobility, of continuous radiolucency around the implant; and the possibility for restoration. Without questioning the relevance of these issues, additional observations have to be taken into consideration, given the functional decline of frail and dependent people were autonomy becomes a concern. Can the patient independently handle and manage the prosthesis? Is a denture still successful when it is sitting in a bathroom cupboard? It seems therefore imperative to add to the implant success criteria a newly defined criterion: “being able to autonomously manage and clean the restoration.” Autonomy is a confirmed key aspect of successful aging. Independently managing a dental prosthesis seems important with this respect. Dental prostheses should therefore be planned and designed to meet the functional capacities of the patient—now and in the future. This does not mean that old and very old patients cannot benefit from the progress in implant dentistry, but rather that an implant prosthesis needs to be sustainable, yet modifiable and designed for adaptation to future needs. Hence, “backing-off ” the sophistication of a dental restoration to a more straightforward and manageable solution may be indicated later in life. Today’s fixed implant reconstructions should be designed to be tomorrow’s overdentures, at first retained by a bar, subsequently stud-type or ball attachments, and finally, in a palliative care setting, by low-retention magnets. The widespread belief that patients request the maximum retention for a removable prosthesis is not true for frail elders, most of whom are profoundly distressed when provided with an appliance that is too retentive. The contemporary role of the dentist implies a lifelong accompaniment along with functional decline and a continuous adaptation of the denture retention to what the patient can still manage autonomously. The practical translation of this paradigm would be the provision of fixed and removable implant reconstructions, which would later be downgraded with little change in shape, vertical height, occlusion, and appearance, hence not challenging the reduced neuroplasticity observed later in life. Computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) will facilitate this process in the future by providing very similar, but simplified versions of the dental prosthesis, at a moderate cost and even without the traditional impression that patients dislike so much.Ultimately, the elder patient may opt to refrain from denture wearing or limit their use during meals and social occasions. Especially in patients presenting with hyposalivation, sensitive mucosa, or dementia, implant dentures require a design that precludes discomfort and injury from attachment systems while the denture is not worn. The “back-off ” strategy also aims to limit biofilm accumulation, which presents a considerable risk for aspiration pneumonia, in particular in patients with swallowing disorders 3 or wearing their dentures during the night.4 Dentistry has to evolve along with the prolonged lifespan of our patients. Under the condition that close monitoring of the patient and, when appropriate, a stepwise “sophistication” of the implant denture is assured, patients can— and should—benefit from the progress in modern implant dentistry until very late in life.",-,"1.Albrektsson T, Zarb G, Worthington P, Eriksson AR.

Clinical practice guidelines for recall and maintenance,"Lily T. Garcia, DDS, MS",-,"There is nothing more troubling than when a patient who has undergone either a simple or a complex restoration including complete oral rehabilitation returns to the office because he or she has neglected to attend to the maintenance of the extensive care provided.In the practice environment, attending to a patient’s neglected maintenance can involve restoration of natural dentition, placement of implants, or both.As dentists, we must make it a priority to help our patients succeed in maintaining that which we restore. As a prosthodontist, nothing satisfies me more than providing a patient with a clinical result that meets, if not exceeds,expectations, producing outcomes that include restoration of the patient’soral function, comfort, appearance, and health. Whether you are a general dentist, dental hygienist, or a dental specialist, it is with all of our education collectively that we strive to improve the oral health of our patients. Using team approach, many of us work with our dental colleagues to develop exquisite treatment plans for our patients.With that said, the authors of previous studies have offered insights into the incidence of clinical complications related to fixed and implant prosthodontics, and in particular, complications with restorations.1-4 Many Complications relate to the biomechanical properties of the materials used intraorally, in addition to caries and periodontal disease. As noted by the authors of these articles, these complications often occur after the fact,after the completion of treatment that addressed the effects of disease sequelae and after both restorative and prosthodontic care has been rendered. The focus of our project to determine clinical practice guidelines(CPG) does not pertain to getting the patient ready for a final restoration,but rather, it pertains to the period after the patient has received all the prescribed treatment and is ready to enter the phase of long-term maintenance.The fundamental premise and driving force for developing the“Clinical Practice Guidelines for Recall and Maintenance of Patients With Tooth-Borne And Implant-Borne Dental Restorations”involved determining how to effectively prescribe and direct the long-term management of patients who have made this investment in their oral health and aid in reducing the risk of these patients experiencing these conditions. The patient’s initial investment involves various resources of time and personal finances.Therefore, it was with deliberate intention that this project developed and included delving into the literature search for the current best evidence related to maintenance for this patient population.The American College of Prosthodontists (ACP) led the project,receiving support from the ACP Education Foundation during my tenure as chair of the ACP Education Foundation. ACP collaborated with team of our dental colleagues from the American Dental Association,the American Dental Hygienists’Association, and the Academy of General Dentistry to develop the CPG and articulate clearly what is essential in the care of our patients.The team committed to a trans-parent, open dialogue and debate throughout the process.As the project evolved, the team found that it was important to consider the variability in the scientific evidence and encourage intellectual debate and dialogue. As Dr. AvinashI. Bidra, a lead author of the article,stated,“Good science generates debate; bad science only generates sensationalism.”Using their expertise, the group affirmed the direction to develop a CPG as opposed to evidence-based guidelines on the basis of conducting an exhaustive literature search process in addition to a manual search process.Use of the design template as defined by the National Guideline Clearinghouse also provided for broad dissemination.5 As anticipated, the resulting CPG generated extensive discussion but also created a collegial environment to ensure that our patients will gain from the best evidence, clinical experience, and professional judgment offered by this highly interactive group.Broad dissemination and use of the CPG in dental practice will serve as a foundational document to encourage further study and generation of additional evidence. We Welcome an open and thoughtful debate regarding these guidelines,which only can improve the oral health of patients.http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.adaj.2015.11.010Copyrightª2016 American Dental Association.

Treatment planning concepts for the ageing patient,RL Ettinger,-,"INTRODUCTION The proportion of people aged 65 years and older in Australia has increased from 11.6% to 14.4% between 30 June 1993 to 30 June 2013.1This ageing imperative in Australia has been described in earlier articles in this supplement. It is important to remember that older adults are extremely heterogeneous and there is no such person as a typical older adult.2 In fact, older adults range from the healthy to the frail, from the highly educated to the illiterate, from the affluent to the poor, from the dentate to the edentulous.3 This heterogeneity has evolved because each person is influenced by their genetic heredity, their diet, their exercise programme, the history of their diseases, and the accidents they have sustained, as well as their lifestyle.4All of these factors influence their health literacy, which influence their motivation in regard to their general health as well as their oral health.5The ageing population The ageing population has usually been defined as a cohort of persons aged 65 years or older. If age is the only criterion used in dentistry, it is not very useful because of the significant heterogeneity of the ageing population. People of a similar age may have experienced great differences in physical health, medical problems, neurodegenerative diseases, mental health, as well as differences in oral health. Thus, from an oral health treatment planning perspective, a functional definition of ageing is more useful. In some ways, dentistry is more like surgery than medicine as we need our ‘operating theatre’ to carry out our surgical and reconstructive care of the oral cavity. In 1984, Ettinger and Beck 6 Modified the Institute of Medicine's Definition of geriatric medicine and suggested the ageing population could be divided into three broad functional groups, which would reflect their ability to seek dental services. These groups are functionally independent older adults, frail older adults and functionally dependent older adults.Functionally independent older adults Functionally independent older adults who live in the community unassisted and comprise about 70% of the population over the age of 65 years. Many of these older adults have some chronic medical problems such as hypertension, type II diabetes, osteoarthritis, etc., for which they are taking a variety of medications. In terms of treatment planning, providing their dental practitioner takes a thorough medical and drug history and understands how their patients’medical issues and the effects of their medications can influence oral health care, their treatment will depend on the patients’ or their significant others’ perception of need and the amount of money they are prepared to pay for it. These older adults can access dental care independently using their own vehicles or public transportation, if it exists.Frail older adults Frail older adults are those people who have lost some of their independence but still live in the community with the help of family and friends or who are using professional support services such as Meals on Wheels, visiting nurses, home health aides, etc. They Make up about 20% of the population over 65 years.These older adults can no longer access general dental services without the help of others. Their oral health needs require a greater understanding of medicine and pharmacology and a careful evaluation of their ability to maintain daily oral hygiene independently, as well as their ability to tolerate treatment.Functionally dependent older adults Functionally dependent older adults are those persons who are no longer able to survive in the community independently and are either homebound (about 5%of the population over 65) or living in institutions(another 5% of the population over 65). Some of these older adults can only access dental services if they are transported to a dentist’s office and many may use wheelchairs, so dental offices need to be wheelchair accessible if the dentist wishes to treat these patients. If they cannot be transported, then the services need to be brought to them through mobile programmes. This means that the dental professional needs to have the will and the experience to accessmobile equipment, if he or she wishes to visit the patient or the institution in which the older adult resides. If that institution has a dental facility, that isa bonus.Treatment planning Informed consent The foundation of treatment planning is that the health care professional and a competent patient voluntarily exchange facts and discuss values so the patient can make an informed decision about their health care. In the past, the population, especially the elderly population went to healthcare professionals for advice and usually followed it, if they could afford it. It was a paternalistic relationship and it is still found amongst illiterate adults, especially immigrants and minorities.7 In the US, the National Adult Literacy Survey 8 Found that half of the US adult population had some difficulty using print materials to accomplish everyday tasks. For people aged over 60, 71% of adults had a problem. This suggests that using written documents for informed consent may limit their understanding of the risks and benefits of treatment options that is an understanding of informed consent.There are data to show that patients with limited health literacy may want and need information clarified but ask fewer questions and are at a greater risk for not understanding their options.10 These patients often sign documents of informed consent without understanding what they are signing.11 Loss of short-term memory can be a problem for a number of older adults. This Loss can influence informed consent as a clinician may spend time with the patient, have them sign a document agreeing to a treatment plan, and after sometime, the patient does not remember what has been discussed or what has been signed. Assessment of early cognitive losses is difficult and can seriously influence consent capacity.12 Good communication with the older patient, as well as their family or significant others, is essential. If the dentist is not skilled at communicating with older patients who have sensory deficits, the true nature of the patient’s chief complaint may be missed. For Example, a 68-year-old man seeks dental treatment.He is wearing a complete maxillary denture and mandibular removable partial denture. The patient’solder brother, a smoker, recently died from oral cancer. This patient, also a smoker, cannot openly vocal-ize his fears and comes to the dentist for an evaluation of his dentures. He cannot ask the dentist to check his mouth for oral cancer but hopes that during the oral examination of his denture, the dentist will say to him that he does not have oral cancer. If The dentist cannot find a problem with the dentures,has not taken a family history, does not read the patient’s body language, there will be a failure in communications and the patient who came for counselling will not get the stress release he is seeking.Decision making The majority of diseases, which dentists treat on a daily basis, are chronic diseases which have no cure and cause irreversible damage. Some of the acute diseases of the oral mucosa and pulp can repair themselves or be cured. In older adults, the majority of the need is to treat the acute exacerbations of caries or periodontal disease.Problem solving that is decision making is an essential component of clinical diagnosis and treatment planning in geriatric dentistry.13–15In younger adults,the factors which influence decision making are whether the clinician has the skill and the resources to treat the particular problems of that patient, whether the patient has the will or the time to accept and pay for that treatment plan. In functionally independent older adults, the process of decision making becomes more complex. Apart from understanding the patient's psychological problems and side effects of the medications they are taking, there are other issues such as the cumulative effects of a lifetime of physiological,traumatic disease-derived problems, as well as iatro-genic effects on the dentition due to dental care.Figure 1 shows restorations in varied states of disrepair, gingivitis, attachment loss, recurrent caries as well as wear and chipping of the dentition in an 82-year-old widow who is living independently in a community about an hour away from the dental surgery. She doesn't drive anymore and relies on the husband of her neighbour to get to dental appointments. She has two married children who live in different cities from her.Her medical problems include a history of hypertension and type II diabetes, arthritis and osteoporosis of the spine. She had a knee replacement three years ago. She has problems hearing in her right ear but does not wear a hearing aid. The patient was concerned because her right maxillary second premolar has fractured at the gingival margin. She has not seen a dentist in three years since her general dentist retired. The medications she is taking are listed below: The knowledge base required to manage the oral problems of such a patient does not depend on the development of new technical skills but rather on the following:(1) An understanding of normal ageing.(2) An understanding of pathological ageing.(3) An understanding of her medical problems and recognizing the oral implication of her systemic diseases.(4) A knowledge of pharmacology and drug-induced dental disease.(5) The interpersonal skills needed to communicate with this patient, her family and her other health providers.(6) Knowing special communication techniques required for older persons who have sensory deficits.(7) Having practical experience in clinical decision-making for such a patient.After evaluating all of her modifying factors, the following evaluations were done at this first appointment. Bitewing radiographs were taken of the posterior teeth which showed some early lesions in enamel.A periapical radiograph of the fractured second right premolar showed no visible pathology and pulp testing found a responsive tooth.Because of the patient’s transport problems, the following treatment plan was developed and approved by her: the teeth were scaled and cleaned; the second right premolar was excavated and sealed with a light-cured resin-reinforced glass ionomer. A 5000 ppm toothpaste was prescribed with a modified handle on the toothbrush to help her clean her teeth, and a follow-up appointment was made for three months. This Rational treatment plan fulfilled the patient’s primary concern about the fractured second right premolar and also addressed the caries in her mouth. At three months it will be possible to re-evaluate her oral hygiene and oral health.The bulk of dental care for frail older adults still remains reconstructive, i.e. the restoration of teeth and the restoration of function of the stomatognathic system with fixed and removable partial dentures.16The clinical techniques are usually similar to those needed for treating younger persons; however, more problems are encountered. For example, in recurrent caries, the margins of interproximal restorations will need to be placed subgingivally with all of the associated problems due to bleeding, marginal adaptation of restorative materials and finishing. Deciding what constitutes appropriate care may vary for an older cohort of individuals because those decisions must include the consideration of a variety of age-related and age-associated psychological, sociological, biological and pathological changes. Therefore, it is essential to identify modifying factors before a comprehensive treatment plan is formulated.Bader and Shugars 18 Reviewed dentists’ clinical decision making and stated ‘the extent to which differences in dentists’ clinical decisions have been examined is limited’. They suggested that the differences were in the way dentists perceived dental diseases and their treatments, and not on factors such as known risk factors, rates of incidence, progress of dis-ease or on outcomes. Braun and Markus 19in a classic study sent study models and radiographs to dentists in private practice and asked them to develop treatment plans. They varied the age of the patients from under 40 to over 60. For the younger age group, teeth adjacent to a space were more likely to be used as abutments for fixed partial dentures. For those patients 60+years old, the extraction rate increased and the dentists were more likely to prescribe a removable prosthesis.For older adults, there have been discussions about the decision making process in the literature and some of these systems are discussed below. Shay 20 Suggested A systematic approach to planning oral care for older adults, which he called OSCAR and which he used to determine the needs of a specific patient (Table 1). Hebelieved that dentists could use OSCAR as a means of fully accounting for all of the factors that could impact an older adult’s potential course of treatment.This is a useful tool for people beginning to treat older adults with complex medical problems.Berkey Et al.21 proposed a similar but different conceptual model. They suggested that in clinical decision making for older adults, there were four domains of dental need that needed to be integrated and the severe function, symptomatology, pathology and aesthetics (Table 2). To achieve these goals, the authors 21 suggested that a series of questions needed to be answered, which were:(1) The patient’s desires and expectations.(2) The type and severity of dental need.(3) The impact on quality of life.(4) The probability of positive outcomes.(5) Reasonable treatment alternatives.(6) The ability to tolerate the stress of treatment.(7) The capability to maintain oral health.(8) Financial and other resources.(9) The dentist’s capabilities.(10) Other issues.Using the information gained from the patient, dentist could weigh the impact of these findings and determine the patient’s needs at five levels of care.These are very extensive care, extensive care, intermediate care, limited care or very limited care (Table 3).In 1983, a decision-making algorithm, called the‘rational dental care model’, was presented at national meeting in Chicago.Although the relative influence of the various modifying factors was unknown, the authors hypothesized that this was the mechanism by which dentists experienced in geriatric care made treatment planning decisions. The authors believed that this model could be usefully incorporated into dental education because it specified thought process that would be helpful for diagnosis and treatment planning for all patients. The model was modified in 1984 (Fig. 2).13To test this modified model, the authors evaluate the similarities and differences among five dentists who were experienced in caring for geriatric patients.22 Each participating dentist individually examined the volunteer older adult patient and then planned a treatment for him. The dentists were videotaped as they interviewed and examined the volunteer patient. Later, the dentists were interviewed by an expert in communications while viewing the videotape of their examination. This interview was also video-taped. During the interview, the dentists were asked to stop the examination videotape and comment on any issue they wanted to discuss. The interviewer could also stop the tape during an interaction between the dentist and the patient, and ask the dentist to clarify his or her rationale for asking the patient a particular question. In particular, the authors wanted to know when the dentist decided on his or her treatment plan.From the videotapes, it was clear that the patient was varying his response slightly from dentist to dentist and that he was not a reliable historian. In spite of that, it seemed that after initial contact with the patient and after looking at the dentition, the dentists knew what treatment they wanted to perform. The Dentists then spent the remainder of the time with the patient developing the feasibility of their preferred option. It was clear that the patient assessment model used by these five dentists was based only on clinical experience and not on a step by step thought process.These findings support those of Feinstein 23 Who started, ‘The way a clinician makes a prognosis for a new patient is to recall the results in a group of previous patients who resemble the current patient’.It has been suggested that dentist should model itself on medicine and that the future of dentistry is to be an oral physician.24 However others do not believe that dentistry is like medicine because in medicine, itis important to make a diagnosis. Once a diagnosis is made, the treatment is usually well prescribed, often guided by evidence-based studies. Dentistry is morelike surgery in that treatment includes removal of an infected part but there can be variations how that is carried out.22Like surgeons, dentists need an operating room (dental office) with specialized instruments to carry out treatment. Much of our treatment is based on anecdotal data and experience rather than evidence-based studies. It became clear to our group that a dentist treating geriatric patients needed experience and must be technically competent, and therefore he or she must be a good clinician.25A discussion of treatment planning cannot be complete without evaluating the role of evidence-based dental care and geriatric minimal intervention.Evidence-based dentistry is the ‘conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients’.26The treatment plan depends upon the clinician integrating the best available research evidence with the clinician’s expertise.27 After gathering the evidence, the risks and benefits of treatment are presented to the patient so that an informed decision can be made. The problem in clinical dentistry,especially in geriatric dentistry, is that there are few randomized clinical trials available to help with decision making. There is a need for research and more systematic reviews to help the clinician make evidence-based decisions.In the 1970s, an evidence-based approach to caries management evolved, which became known as minimal intervention dentistry (MID).28 The basic philosophy of the model was that dental diseases are chronic, infectious diseases and their treatment should be based more on a medical model than on a mechanistic one. The main components of MIS are ‘assessment of the risk of disease, with a focus on early detection and preservation; external and internal remineralization; use of a range of restorations, dental materials, and equipment; and surgical intervention only when required and only after the disease has been controlled’.29–31 Using MID, the clinician needs to:32(1) Control the disease by identifying and, if possible, manage the risk factors and allow an assessment of the severity of the disease.(2) Detect the carious lesions as early as possible and try to remineralize the lesions without a need for restorations by the use of fluorides.(3) Keep the necessary restorative procedures minimally invasive by removing only the ‘caries infected’ dentine but retaining the ‘caries affected’ dentine.(4) If possible, repair defective restorations rather than replace them. (5) Try to change the patient’s behaviours related to dietary habits, oral hygiene, antibacterial therapy and use of fluorides.(6) Reinforce patient education by appropriate recalls to monitor the patient’s oral health.Ngo and Gaffney 33 Presented an algorithm for oral disease management in MID, which included the assessment of some modifying factors, such as medical history, medications, socio-economic status, etc., followed by a number of primary factors, which influence the biofilm such as diet, saliva, fluoride, etc.These evaluations influence how the patient would be managed to convert the cariogenic biofilm to a healthy one. If this flow diagram is combined with the rational care concept, it allows treatment to be more inclusive as shown in Fig. 3. Several risk management systems have evolved to look at risk assessment such as Caries Management by Risk Assessment(CAMBRA),34a form developed by the American Dental Association dentists (ADA),35 one developed by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (CAT),36anda cariogenic assessment system (Cariogram) in Sweden.37In a recent review paper, Teile Et al.38 critically evaluated these four systems. They reported there was a wide variation among the systems in terms of defining what was a caries risk category. The Cariogram System was the only one in which there were good data for predicting caries in the permanent dentition and limited utility in preschool children and was moderately useful for elderly persons. They concluded ‘there is an urgent need to develop valid and reliable methods for caries risk assessment’.Strategy for decision making Two conditions, which contribute to problems in decision making for older adults, are complexity and uncertainty. Decision making uncertainty occurs when there is insufficient knowledge relative to the significant variables and possible outcomes. The dentist maybe uncertain about the nature of the dental problems and when, or even if, it should be treated. One example is an elderly woman who had recently relocated and was brought to the dental office by her son for a check-up. Routine radiographic evaluation revealed a central incisor that had had root canal therapy. This Tooth had a well-circumscribed periapical lesion.When the patient was questioned, the tooth was asymptomatic but she was a poor historian. She was mildly confused and the son had power of attorney and could not remember when the tooth had been treated. It was not possible to contact her previous dentist, who according to the son was deceased. The Dentist could not be sure if this was an active processor a healing lesion. If it were an active process, the treatment of choice might have been to redo the root canal therapy; however, if it were a healing lesion, the patient should be examined at regular intervals.Uncertainty about the possible therapeutic treatment alternatives and whether resources were available to carry them out was also a factor. If the patient was in good health, no particular problem would exist. How-ever, as this patient had a history of early Alzheimer's Disease, would it be more therapeutically correct to observe the tooth over a period of time? Since it is known that a patient with Alzheimer’s disease will physically and mentally deteriorate over time, but have a limited lifespan, should the root canal therapy be redone or should the tooth be extracted? Specifically, the dentist may be uncertain about the prognosis for this patient.Dentists who care for older frail adults face these kinds of decision problems on a daily basis. However, decision needs to be made and the son needs to be offered guidance so he can make an informed decision asto what is in the best interests of his mother. The recommendation in this situation could be to do nothing except to emphasize the need for regular recalls. The reasons for coming to this conclusion are as follows:(1) There are no apparent signs or symptoms that an active disease process exists.(2) The site is easy to see and check and the son needs to be informed to look for signs of change,such as swelling or looseness of the tooth.(3) The worst-case scenario for this condition is a periapical abscess, which can be dealt with by redoing a root canal or by doing an apicoectomy extraction the tooth.(4) The mother has a limited lifespan, usually 7–10 years from the time the initial diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is made, and the tooth seems symptom-free at this time.Decision-making problem complexities occur when multiple relevant variables exist. These include consideration of a variety of treatment alternatives, as well as the criteria on which a decision will be based. Dental diseases are not always associated with a specific curative therapy and recent improvements in dental materials have resulted in more treatment options becoming available.For instance, for a patient with root caries, the treatment of the lesions must include: an evaluation of the patient’s ability to maintain daily oral hygiene as well as any xerostomic potential of the drugs they are using; the extent of the lesion; the status of the lesion, i.e. active or arrested; access to the lesion; ability to keep the tooth dry during restorative procedures; proximity of the lesion to the cemento-enamel junction, whether it is subgingival; and aesthetics. An evaluation of these factors will determine which restorative approach should be used:(1) remineralization with topical fluorides;(2) recontouring to make the tooth self-cleaning;(3) utilization of appropriate restorative materials,such as amalgam, glass-ionomer cements, composite resin; or(4) extraction of the tooth or teeth.There needs to be consideration of patient-related factors, which can directly affect the prognosis of the dental treatment, such as health, neuromuscular ability, vision and motivation, which add to the complexity of treatment planning decisions. Since the dentist must choose the best therapeutic alternative and anticipate the consequences of that decision on later events, such as the deterioration in the health of the patient, the treatment planning situation can become even more challenging.Ideal or rational treatment planning: a dilemma The ideal treatment plan has been described by Barsh39as ‘that leading to the best dental prognosis without taking modifying factors into account’. Traditionally,this has been based on the application of morphological concepts; i.e. the dentist views the dentition and proceeds technically to evaluate how many teeth can be saved or replaced without evaluating any other limiting factors. This morphologically-based approach has been described by Levin 40as ‘the 28-tooth syndrome’ and was usually compatible with healthy patients in a fee-for-service system. As stated previously more older adults are maintaining more teeth and the question becomes how much restoration of the occlusion isrequired for these older adults. Ramfjord and Ash,41 while discussing the replacement of lost teeth, stated that ‘clinical experience indicates that satisfactory function and occlusion, as well as neuromuscular stability,usually can be established if all bicuspids and anterior teeth are present, even if these teeth have lost a considerable amount of periodontal support’. The concept of the shortened dental arch was originally introduced by Kayser 42 who followed 118 subjects with different degrees of arch reduction and showed that there was sufficient adaptive capacity to maintain adequate oral function when at least four posterior occlusal units remained, preferably in a symmetric position. Since that time, there have been a number of studies,43–45 which supported a positive outcome both financially 46 and functionally.47 Currently, if there is loss of a tooth or teeth, there are very few criteria or guidelines to replace the tooth or teeth. To answer that problem one needs to evaluate the patient and determine:(1) How long has the tooth or teeth been missing? If The extractions are recent then it is important to look at the stability of the occlusion.(2) Is there an antagonist and has it moved? If there has been movement then a replacement may be necessary to preserve or re-establish the occlusal plane.(3) Is there an aesthetic problem? If the patient is severely cognitively impaired, replacement of anterior teeth needs to be evaluated in terms of the risks and benefits to preserving the remaining dentition.(4) Can the patient chew comfortably and effectively, are there adequate numbers of chewing pairs of teeth?(5) Are there any joint symptoms? If there are, theremay be a need for posterior support of the occlu-sion.It also becomes important to assess the remaining teeth. For older adults, especially those with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease,dementia or people with tardive dyskinesia, the maintenance of some mandibular teeth is critical, because these people cannot adapt to complete mandibular dentures. Therefore all teeth need to be evaluated in terms of their value to the dentition and some are more valuable than others and have been described as‘key teeth’.(1) A key tooth is one that can support itself or other teeth.(2) A key tooth is one which, if lost, dramatically changes the treatment plan, e.g. from a fixed partial denture to a removable partial denture; from no removable partial denture to a removable partial denture; and from a tooth supported removable partial denture to a distal extension removable partial denture.(3) A key tooth is one that is required to maintain an adequate chewing pair.When caring for ageing populations who have modifying factors, which are often significant, a patient-oriented approach requiring rational decisions is essential. Berkey 14 Has suggested that the dentist should begin by asking several basic questions, such as:(1) What is the patient’s dental problem?(2) Why did it occur?(3) What can I do about it?(4) What will be the outcome?Based on the assumption that as people age, they become increasingly compromised because of their various medical, social and psychological problems, modification of the American Society for Anesthesiologists’ evaluation system has been used to assess patients. Using the system as a reference, therapy modi-fication and patient management approaches have been suggested. This modified system provides guidelines for the dental treatment of medically compromised patients requiring anaesthesia.48 kamen 49 Further modified the system by dividing the care provided into four broad categories. Although this system provides a useful con-cept, it has faults that Gordon and Kress50 Describe bystating, ‘when applied to specific situations, the system is somewhat simplistic in that many patients fall between categories and many choices remain even within one category’. Little Et al.51 states, ‘this system is limited in that it does not provide specific information about how treatment may be modified’.One of the difficulties encountered in treatment planning is that dental treatment options are continuously evolving and new information and techniques are becoming available to clinicians. Also, treatment planning is as much an art as it is a science. For Example, an 81-year-old female (Mrs B) is brought to your office by her daughter-in-law. The daughter-in-law complains that the mother-in-law is not eatingwell and that she has oral discomfort. The patient has not been to a dentist in the past except to get teeth extracted. She understands some English but does not speak it well. She is illiterate in her own language.Medical history The patient has congestive heart failure and has a history of chest pain due to angina pectoris. The last chest pain was two days ago at home when she was doing some housekeeping. She has had hypertension for the last 10 years; her blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg. She has cataracts, which will be surgically treated in a month, and she is hard of hearing.The patient has severe osteoarthritis of the knees and spine and is overweight. She had her right knee replaced just over two years ago.Medication history The daughter-in-law brought in Mrs B’s daily medications as we had requested in our letter to the patient prior to the appointment. Her medications are listed in Table 4, which also identified their potential oral side effects and the management issues associated with them.Oral examination There was overeruption of #26 and #46. There wasa periapical lesion on the distal root of #26 and on#31. There was condensing osteitis on tooth #46. There Was a premature contact between #16 and #46, which created a forward slide in the occlusion. There were carried on the mesial of #35 and distal of #33 and #34. All teeth showed significant wear. The mouth wasn't very dry but the patient did report that she had a very dry mouth in the morning on awakening.So how should one approach this patient’s needs?There are some basic questions a clinician must answer in his or her mind to successfully diagnose and treat such an elderly patient:21(1) What are the patient’s oral problems?(2) What is the patient’s chief complaint?(3) How and why are these problems occurring?(4) What are the main modifying factors influencing the oral health care of the patient and has the right data been gathered?(5) Can I solve these problems or do I need help from other health professionals or specialists?(6) What will happen if I do nothing?(7) Can I predict the outcome of this treatment plan that I think may help this patient and what treatment would increase the risk for the patient?To answer these questions and to develop a rational treatment plan, a decision tree was used which is shown in Fig. 4. We also gathered answers to the following modifying factors:1. What are the patient’s desires and expectations?Oral health is defined not only by objective signs but also by the subject’s or patient’s perceived symptoms. For Mrs B, we need to rely on the daughter-in-law to help with informed consent. The patient comes from a culture where whatever the ‘doctor’ says is right. We May Need To Have Thesun(who's in the healthfield)come and help with informed consent. The primary need is that the patient wishes to be comfortable and to have enough teeth to be able to chew her food.2. What are the patient’s dental needs and how complex are her problems?The patient is in discomfort so we need to identify where the discomfort is coming from and deal with thatfirst. Tooth #26 is responsible for her discomfort and after discussion, there is agreement to extract it.Her dental problems are: missing posterior teeth;heavily worn dentition with loss of vertical dimension;over erupted teeth; periapical pathosis #26 and #31;caries #33, #34, and #35; and plaque and calculus.To ensure that she has enough chewing pairs of teeth, removable partial dentures may be necessary for both arches. How to manage #16 and #46 will need to be assessed.3. What is the impact of her dental problems on her quality of life?The patient is in discomfort and having difficulty chewing. The pain is associated with tooth #26 and this tooth is overerupted and has a periapical lesion.Extraction of the tooth would alleviate the pain and then allow an assessment of the patient’s masticatory needs. The question is how much treatment can this patient tolerate? How invasive can the treatment be?Can she maintain oral hygiene independently?4. What is the impact of her medical problems onher dental treatment?Mrs B is living with her son and daughter-in-law and being supported by them. To evaluate her medical problems, we had to talk to her physician.He confirmed the patient’s medical history and added that the patient had a mitral valve prolapse.Chronic congestive heart failure Mrs B became short of breath easily when experiencing mild stress such as walking from the waiting room down a corridor to the clinic. Therefore, stress reduction procedures were necessary during treatment 52(Table 5). We will need to have oxygen available during treatment and monitor her vital signs. If she shows anxiety then a short-acting benzodiazepine could be used, such as lorazepam 1.0 to 2.0 mg one hour prior to the procedure or oxazepam 10 to 15 mg one hour prior to the procedure.53 Angina pectoris Mrs B had chest pain two days ago when doing some light housework. The pain went away in a few minutes after she sat down and placed one 0.4 mg tablet of nitroglycerin under her tongue. To treat her, we will need to monitor her vital signs at all appointments and have nitroglycerin available as well as oxygen. In particular,if the appointment is deemed to be stressful or if she is susceptible to frequent angina attacks, she should take a prophylactic dose of 0.4 mg sublingually 3 to 5 minutes before beginning treatment.53 For patients with cardiovascular disease, it is advisable to have short mid-morning appointments, adequate anaesthesia, and if required, sedation to reduce stress, which increases the oxygen demand of the myocardium.52 It is standard procedure in our practice to record blood pressure and pulse rates for all new adult and older dental patients at the initial appointment.52 If patients report a history of hypertension, even if it is controlled by medication, their blood pressure should be monitored and recorded before treatment and before patient dismissal, especially if local anaesthetics have been used.52 Hypertension Her blood pressure (BP) seemed stable at her last appointment at 160/95 of mms of Hg. However, we need to monitor BP at each appointment. We would want to institute a stress-reduction protocol 53 and limit the amount of epinephrine used in local anaesthetics to follow the American Heart Association Guidelines of no more than 0.036 mg of epinephrine at any one time. This translates to using no more than2½carpules of 1.7ccs of 2% xylocaine with 1:100 000 epinephrine. To prevent local anaesthetic entering directly into a blood vessel, a technique of deliberate aspiration is required before slowly deposit-ing the local anaesthetic. Warming the solution prior to injection also reduces discomfort.54–58 Due to the circadian stickiness of platelets the patient should not be seen between 6am and 9am.59,60 The use of local haemostatic agents, such as epinephrine-impregnated gingival retraction cord, is considered dangerous and is contraindicated for all older patients. Patients on propranolol should not be given epinephrine because unopposed vagal stimulation can produce bradycardia and hypotension.52ForMrs B, one would use carbocaine or citanest 3% with octapressin. The long-term inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) has been shown to result in accumulation of norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, tyramine and tryptamine in various tissues. The Use of local anaesthetic with epinephrine is contraindicated in persons taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors(MAO) because epinephrine may precipitate a hypertensive crisis.61 Osteoarthritis The patient has difficulty walking because of the osteoarthritis in her knees, which is aggravated by her being overweight. We would want to make sure she had taken her pain medication before her dental appointment and we would want to give her a late morning appointment or an early afternoon appointment. This will allow her to stretch and get over the stiffness from sleeping. Her appointments should be short. Ideally, including time travelling to the appointment, it should be no more than 90 minutes.52 Mrs B had her right knee replaced two years ago.The guidelines agreed to by oral surgeons and orthopaedic surgeons in 200362 suggested that if a person did not have infection, revision, or replacement of the artificial joint for two years, then there was no need for prophylactic antibiotics (amoxicillin 2 gm, one hour prior to the invasive procedure). The 2013 con-sensus conference reported that the evidence is inconclusive that there is a benefit in using prophylactic antibiotics for patients with large joint replacements.635. What is the impact of her medications on her dental treatment?The influence of Mrs B’s daily medication on heroral condition and on her dental management is shown in Table 4.6. What is her ability to maintain oral hygiene independently?This is a key factor in decision making as plaque control is essential for the maintenance of natural teeth. The compliance with any preventive regimen will depend on the patient having:(a) Adequate knowledge of why she needs to clean her teeth and to understand that her dry mouth puts her into the high risk category for caries and periodontal disease. Because of the language problems, we need to keep the explanations as simple and as practical as possible.(b) Adequate motivation is needed if people are to change behaviours. In Mrs B’s case, she told usthatshewantedtokeepasmanyteetha possible so the prognosis for her cooperation is good.(c) Adequate neuromuscular skills are necessary to hold a toothbrush. One must have adequate vision to see and enough hand-eye coordination to put the brush where it needs to be most effective. MrsB has osteoarthritis of her hands. To help improve oral hygiene there are several options one could try. The simplest is to put a toothbrush through a small rubber ball to help hold the brush more easily or one could have the family buy her an electric toothbrush. Treatment of her cataracts will also help with vision during toothbrushing.7. Are there any financial limitations on her treatment plan?Mrs B is entirely dependent on her son and daughter-in-law for financial support. She has no dental insurance. Her daughter-in-law told us that her dentalcare would be financed at a ‘reasonable level’ by the family.8. What is the ability of the dentist to deliver the care needed?The dental care required for this patient is not technically difficult for a general dentist. It would be a combination of extractions, restorations, possible endodontics and prosthodontics. The difficulty is in the communication, informed consent, the diagnostics,and finally the decision making. To determine the patient’s needs, one would have to decide on: what is the appropriate care; when should the treatment bedone; how much treatment; and in what sequence should the treatment be done.9. What is the probability of success for treatment?Provided the patient’s systemic health does not deteriorate further, we can treat her, however:(a) Communications and informed consent will be a problem and we will need the help of her son to deal effectively with this problem.(b) Transportation will not be a problem as the daughter-in-law has committed her time to help.However, because the patient gets out of breath,we need to give her time to recover from the stress of getting from the parking lot to the dental chair.A wheelchair would help, if she will accept it.(c) Her xerostomia will increase the risk of caries and periodontal disease and cause problems with wearing dentures. It is important to avoid a complete denture, especially on the mandible.(d) Determining the vertical dimension of occlusion will be a problem. The use of interim removable partial dentures will help us diagnostically.(e) Her motivation seems to be good and her hand-eye coordination is adequate. The overall probability of success is fair and since the patient is in pain, it is imperative to determine the cause of heparin and eliminate it as soon as possible. The Overriding rule for the older patient, as with all patients, is that the treatment rendered must benefit the patient and do no harm.Final treatment planThe treatment plan was developed after evaluation of the modifying factors and following the concerns raised by the decision tree. Mounted study casts were made to help with the decisions on reconstruction of the dentition. The treatment could be divided into phases and each phase was a re-evaluation point in terms of the patient’s tolerance of treatment:A Emergency care(1) Extraction of tooth #26 and #31.(2) Have nitroglycerine and oxygen available.(3) Prescribe oxazepam 15 mg one hour before the surgical procedures.(4) No antibiotic prophylaxis is required for Mrs B.B Disease control(1) Clean and scale the teeth.(2) Adjust occlusion between #16 and #46.(3) Restore #16 and #33, #34, and #55 with composite resin.C Reconstruction(1) Do a diagnostic wax-up to estimate vertical dimension of occlusion.(2) Do composite build-ups of the following teeth:maxilla #13, #12, #11, #21, #26, #23.(3) Restore the tips and hollows of the following teeth: mandible #32, #33, #34, #35, #42, #43,#44.(4) Deliver interim resin removable partial dentures with wrought wire clasps on the maxilla and mandible.(5) Wait 3–6 months and evaluate if the patient is comfortable, if so replace the removable partial dentures, with cast removable partial dentures.D Maintenance and monitoring The treatment was completed within two months.After radical changes to the size of the maxillary restorations, the patient was happy with her appearance and able to chew comfortably. She did not wish for the partial dentures to be replaced. She returned on recall regularly for three years and then died in her sleep of a cardiac event.DISCUSSION Clinical decision making in dentistry tends to be based on qualitative, subjective estimates that the benefits of a specific treatment outweigh the possible alternatives. In dentistry, a clinician traditionally has collected useful pieces of evidence and synthesize them into a sequenced subjective treatment plan,which usually is based on his/her clinical experience.These decisions usually are based on the patient’sage-associated psychological, social, biological, and pathological profile. Grembowski Et al.64 have indicated that clinical decision making should be a social process that includes the dentist, patient, and sometimes others.CONCLUSIONS This case history illustrates that it is possible to do restorative work for a frail at-risk patient, if one understands the influence social and medical problems have upon the oral cavity and dental treatment. It is imperative that a stepwise approach is used and that no irreversible step is taken until an adequate risk-assessment of potential for success has been made. Itis important to maintain ‘key teeth’, especially in the mandibular arch. The fundamental concept for successful treatment is to understand how the patient functions in his or her environment and how dentistry fits into his or her overall needs.DISCLOSURE The author has no conflicts of interest to declare.",-,"1.

Geriatric Dentistry Curriculum in Six Continents,"Irina Xavier,*, Ronald L. Ettinger, Luís Proença, João Botelho, Vanessa Machado,João Rua, Ana S. Delgado and JoséJ. Mendes","The purpose of this study was to examine the presence of geriatric dentistry (GD) in the curricula of worldwide dental schools, and to identify and compare their curriculum content. Eighty-three dental schools (16.4% response rate), from 24 countries, in six continents, completed a 25-item online questionnaire, to assess their GD curriculum, and were included in the study. GD was a mandatory course in 56 dental schools (67.5%), an independent subject in 14 schools (16.9%),and was taught as a series of lectures in 31 schools (37.4%). Clinically, 56 dental schools (67.5%) had some form of mandatory education in GD. The type of school, location and method of presentation were not associated with greater interest in expanding their curriculum in GD (p=0.256,p=0.276,andp=0.919, respectively, using the Chi-square test). We found GD is a curriculum requirement in most of the surveyed dental schools and is becoming more common among dental school curricula. This survey is the first study to present data from dental schools from all continents, using a web-based survey which is a resourceful, less-expensive tool to gather data.","1. Introduction Population aging—the inevitable increase in the share of older persons that results from the decline in fertility and improvement in survival that characterize the demographic transition—is occurring throughout the world [1]. In 2030, older persons are expected to outnumber children under age 10 and the number of older persons is expected to double by 2050 (nearly 2.1 billion) [1]. Many of these elderly people are at a higher risk of several oral diseases mainly because age is a risk factor [2]. Furthermore,many are demanding more complex and interdisciplinary treatment rather than the simple solution of the past such as dental extractions of the remaining teeth and complete dentures [3,4]. The social and educational characteristics of these elderly persons are different from past cohorts, as they are better educated and have higher health expectations [4].The term geriatric dentistry (GD) emerged in the 1970′s from discussions on how to educate dental students to treat compromised older adults [5]. Since then, it has been stated that students need to be well prepared to provide care for older adults and changes need to be made to improveD teaching [6]. In 1978, the first survey on the content of the curricula of GD in dental schools in the United States of America (USA) was published by Swoope [7]. Throughout the years, geriatric curriculum development in dental schools has varied greatly, influenced by multiple factors such as the school characteristics and the interests of the faculty [4,8]. A recent study found that 92.8% ofthe responding dental schools in the USA had GD as a compulsory subject in their curriculum [9].This study also states government funded public dental schools were marginally more interested in expanding their GD syllabus [9]. Another study reported that the non-industrialized countries where the population has a shorter life expectancy and smaller elderly population have the lowest prevalence of teaching GD [10]. The more industrialized countries, such as Canada and the USA, have integrated geriatric content in most of their dental schools [6,9,11].This reported disparity in teaching GD, the aging of the world’s population, and the development of new technologies and pedagogical materials raises the need to analyze how dental schools are currently teaching GD. Therefore, this global survey aimed to examine the presence of GOD in the curriculum of dental schools, and to identify curriculum content, to compare these findings with previous reports.2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Ethical Considerations The study was submitted to Egas Moniz Ethical Committee and was approved under protocol. 866).2.2. Participants web-search and consultation with country representatives of dental associations and societies,including the WDF (World Dental Federation, Geneva, Switzerland), ADEA (American Dental Education Association, Washington, D.C., USA) and DGES (Direcção Geral de Ensino Superior,Portugal Ministry of Education, Lisbon, Portugal) was compiled. A world directory of dental schools compiled by the WDF was also consulted. These searches resulted in a list of 782 dental schools in102 countries. Through institutional contacts we identified and validated the emails of 506 dental schools (64.7%), from 65 different countries, for contact. From 782 potential schools, only 506 had contact email. After sending the questionnaire, 399 did not produce any response, and 107 schools have answered to the survey, of which 83 completed the questionnaire properly. The name of the Dental School was also asked in the questionnaire to eliminate duplicates as several emails were sent to the same school in an attempt to increase response rate. These results are not shown to maintain schools’ anonymity. When two responses from the same dental school were received and all answers were the same, one would be discarded as a duplicate to avoid bias. No responses from the same dental school were received with conflicting answers.2.3. Questionnaire The questions were based on previously applied questionnaires [3,8,12] and consisted of 25 items.Each school was invited to participate by filling out an online anonymous questionnaire. Respondents Were to report about their geriatric program, whether it was an undergraduate or postgraduate program.Repeated reminders were sent to non-responding schools. A maximum of five reminder emails were sent. All closed-ended questions offered the option to add more details where appropriate. Out of the 506 dental schools, 107 (21.1%) accepted to participate and completed the survey. From those,24 schools were excluded because they did not identify their country of origin/name of the dental school. Thus, a final sample of 83 dental schools, from 24 countries and six continents, were included in the study with a 16.4% response rate. Answers were received from June 2018 to February 2019.2.4. Statistics Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.0 for Windows (Armonk, NY,USA: IBM Corp.). Descriptive and inferential statistics methodologies were applied. The Chi-square test was used to assess the association between relevant variables. A level of significance of 5% was set for all inferential analyses.3. Results 3.1. Dental Schools Characteristics A total of 83 dental schools completed the questionnaire (Table 1). Twenty schools were private(24.1%) and 63 (75.9%) were publicly funded. Of the respondents, 19 (22.9%) were associate deans,33 (39.8%) were department chairpersons, 21 (25.3%) were program directors who were directly responsible for teaching GD, while 10 (12.0%) were faculty professors with primary responsibility for teaching GD. The majority (72.3%) of the dental schools had a 5-year program for pre-doctoral education. Countries whose contacted schools did not produce any responses were not included in Table 1.3.2. Geriatric Dentistry Teaching All the dental schools reported that they taught GD in their pre-doctoral programs. The results are shown in Table 2. The method most frequently reported was that GD was integrated into curriculum,followed by a lecture in another course. These were the only methods reported in Africa and Oceania.In terms of who was responsible for teaching the GD courses, 22 (26.5%) schools had a specific person,47 (56.6%) were by a multidisciplinary team and 14 (16.7%) had no one in particular responsible. When Asked about the qualifications of the coordinator of the GD courses, 39 (47.0%) schools reported that the faculty member responsible had had formal training in GD. The most common finding was that multiple departments were responsible for teaching GD(didactic 42%, clinical 35%) followed by prosthodontics departments (didactic 27%, clinical 33.8%),as shown in Table 3. Teaching GD in Comprehensive care and family dentistry department was reported in North America and Asia, while no GD was reported to be taught in oral medicine, as in an earlier study [12]. Fifty-six dental schools (67.5%) reported that GOD was compulsory/mandatory in their pre-doctoral clinical and didactic courses. Also, GD was taught as a specific independent course in 28 (33.7%),schools, as an organized series of presentations in other courses in the curriculum in 28 (33.7%) schools,and as occasional lectures as a part of clinical specialties in 25 (30.1%) schools. GD was only taught as part of occasional courses in 2.4% of all schools which responded to the questionnaire.The questionnaire also asked the schools when they taught GD in their curriculum. Forty-four schools reported that it was taught to their fifth-year (52.5%) students, while 43.8% taught it in the fourth year and 22.5% to their first-year students. Four out of the nine 6-year dental school programs taught GD during the final year of dental school.Table 4 shows how undergraduate GD programs were funded by the surveyed dental schools.In this study, 18.0% of the schools reported no funding, 11.8% had only funding for the postgraduate programs and 20.6% had support for both undergraduate and postgraduate programs funded.No postgraduate programs were reported from North America nor from Africa, and India (n=8),Brazil (n=6) and Mexico (n=4) were the countries with most postgraduate programs. From Oceania,only New Zealand reported a federal government postgraduate program. Regarding undergraduate programs, most countries reported funding from federal government and local/state government,while Oceania did not report undergraduate program funding. The questionnaire also asked dental schools if they were planning to expand their geriatric programs. Fifty-one percent reported that they were currently planning on expanding the teaching of GOD and these dental schools were mainly located in South America. The type of school, school location and method of presentation were not found to be associated with an increased interest in expanding the curriculum in GD (p=0.256,p=0.276, andp=0.919, respectively).In the undergraduate dental programs, a thesis or some sort of publication was not required in all dental schools. When asked on how many thesis, undergraduate degree work, or journal article publications on gerontology, geriatrics, or geriatric dentistry have been made in the last 10 years, it was reported that there were on average 10 publications in the last 10 years, per responding dental school(n=57).3.3. Curriculum Content The subjects covered in the didactic lectures and seminar courses for both compulsory/mandatory and elective/optional GD programs are listed in Table 5. The topics were classified similarly to how they were previously reported in earlier studies [4,9], i.e., the topics were divided into those that were traditional and most likely to be taught in oral medicine and prosthodontic courses (Table 5-A) and those that were more non-traditional or gerontological (Table 5-B), and would not usually be included in a dental school curriculum. There were major differences in which topics were taught, in schools in which the GD curriculum was compulsory or elective. For instance, a topic such as “oral manifestations of systemic disease” was taught in 78 dental schools, 73.1% as a compulsory curriculum and in only26.9% as an elective curriculum.The most popular traditional topic was “Medical problems of elderly people”, taught in 81 of the 83 responding dental schools. It was taught by 67.9% of the schools with a compulsory curriculum and in only 32.1% of the schools with an elective curriculum. The least popular traditional topics “Nutritional problems of the aging patient”, taught in 69 dental schools, in which 62.3% was taught in schools with a compulsory curriculum and only 37.7% in those with an elective curriculum.For gerontological topics, the most popular one was “Barriers to dental care”, taught in 70 dental schools, of which 68.6% had a compulsory curriculum and 31.4% an elective curriculum. The least popular topics were “Speech and hearing problems” and “geriatric assessment scales”, taught in only53 surveyed dental schools. “Other topics” were taught in 22 dental schools, of which 59.1% were taught in schools with a compulsory curriculum and 40.9% in those with an elective curriculum.In some dental schools (N=51) clinical care for geriatric patients occurred at remote sites, mostly in old people’s homes (49.0%) and nursing homes (41.2%), followed by geriatric day care centers(31.4%) and satellite or community clinics (29.4%), as shown in Table 6. Schools with required didactic courses (n=56) were more likely to have required clinical components (59.0%), no trend by country/region was found. Most schools with elective didactic courses (n=27) had an elective clinical education program (70.4%). 3.4. Comparison with Previous Reports The analysis of GD curriculum over time and its comparison with previous reports is listed in detail in Tables S1–S7 in the Supporting Information. Specifically, the 25-item questionnaire sent to dental schools, the inclusion of GD teaching into curriculum over time, comparison of dedicated Gerodontology teaching formats, topics covered by lectures and seminars, funding of geriatric undergraduate programs, remote sites of clinical geriatric care, and department responsibility for teaching didactic and clinical GD.4. Discussion report of the presence of GOD in the curricula of some dental schools is presented. To achieve this,we contacted 506 dental schools from 65 countries to complete an online questionnaire. Eighty-three dental schools completed the questionnaire (16.4%). Briefly, our results found that GOD was being taught in the curricula of all responding schools.This report is particularly important because it is the first to compile information from dental schools across the six continents. GD was a compulsory course in 67.5% of the responding schools,compared to the 89.0–92.8% reported [9,13,14] in the USA and the 82.0% in Europe [15]. However,Kossioni et al. in 2017 [2] reported similar findings from European dental schools (52.0%).Additionally, 62.7% of the schools were teaching GD as a combination of didactic courses and clinical rotations. These results represent a remarkable increase compared to previous surveys which have reported teaching of GD only in 15.8–28.0% of the responding dental schools [11,16,17].Nevertheless, the teaching format of GD varies among countries and dental schools, similar to previous reports [3,4,9,10].In 62.7% of dental schools with GD as a didactic course also had a clinical component located atan extramural site, which was higher than 26.8% reported for Europe in 2017 [2] but lower than in the USA in 1981 [12], 2003 [11], and 2012 [17], as well as in Austria, Switzerland and Germany [16](see Table S6 in Supporting Information). Also, 71.0% of Chilean schools had an outreach clinical rotation site [3]. There is evidence that if dental students have clinical experiences through extramural rotations it will improve their confidence to provide care and improve the chances that they will care for frail older adult patients after graduation [18–20]. In this study, a clinical component was reported in 66.3% of the schools, which was higher than the 61% described in a previous European study [15].Mandatory/compulsory clinical experiences for dental students in the USA increased from 59% in 1974 to 67% in 2003 [17] and to 67.9% in 2016 [9], compared with 71.4% reported in our study. It should be noted, however, that not all US dental schools responded to the survey, and from the five responses from American schools, two responded their clinical education program in GD was elective.With regard to the content of the syllabus in GD, the results of the past four decades in the USA [9],show a tendency of teaching traditional topics, associated with oral medicine and prosthodontics.These topics include, “medical problems of elderly people”; “oral and dental tissue changes associated with aging”; and “oral manifestations of systemic disease”. Other important subjects such as “barriers to dental care”, “socio-economic problems”, “demographic distribution of elderly people” and “oral management of the functionally independent adult” have also been taught over the last 40 years.When we asked the dental schools about their intention to expand their GD curriculum, 51.0% of dental schools reported that they were currently planning to expand, which was similar to 47.1% of European schools [2] and 53.6% of USA schools [4] reported in previous studies. We found that clinical geriatric care was being delivered by students at remote sites, 49.0% in old people’s homes and 41.2%in nursing homes, similarly to previous reports [6,9,17]. As stated earlier, students who spend more time with older adults during dental school expressed more confidence in their knowledge in how to treat frail older adults and were more likely to treat them after graduation [18–20].In 2017, it was found that prosthodontics, preventive and community and family dentistry departments were mainly responsible for teaching these courses in the USA [4], Austria, Switzerland And Germany [16]. Most of the respondents to our survey stated that multiple departments were responsible for teaching didactic and clinical GD, followed by prosthodontics (Table 3). In the USA,40.0% of American dental schools reported having special patient care clinics and 18.0% required extramural rotations for their students [14]. With regard to specialization, 33.3% of the respondents to a 2017 European study reported that there were dentists specializing in Gerodontology in their country [2].We asked dental schools if the geriatric program (whether it was an undergraduate or postgraduate program) was funded. In this study, most undergraduate clinical programs were being funded by their federal governments, while postgraduate programs were mostly being funded by corporate/private grants (Table 4). Patient revenues accounted for only a small proportion of the funding (26.5%). Funding of postgraduate programs was less common by the government (7.4%) thanby private grants (11.8%). Patient revenues made up for some of the funding (10.3%), which was not the case in earlier USA studies [12,17]. Past studies reported a high percentage of funded postgraduate programs in GD, 91.9% in Europe [2] and 60.4% in the USA [4].Regarding research and publications about GD in the undergraduate programs, it was reported an average of 10 publications in the last 10 years, per responding dental school (n=57). An earlier study reported a steady increase in the average number of annual publications in Austria, Switzerland And Germany over the years [16]. The average number of publications had risen from 3.3 in 2004,to 4.6 in 2009, to 5.5 in 2014 [16]. Research in GD may be used as a tool for facilitating learning in undergraduate programs and share valuable information, as well as increase public awareness in the subject of research.Changes in attitudes towards GD seem to have been occurring worldwide [10]. Brazil was the first country to recognize the specialty of GD in 2001 [10]. New Zealand and Australia have developed graduate programs in special needs dentistry that includes geriatrics, as have England and Ireland [10].The Special Care Dentistry Association in the United States have developed a diplomate program in geriatric and special needs dentistry [10].Therefore, teachers and clinicians should be required to care for the oral health needs of the aging population, and students should be prepared by having clinical experiences in locations outside the protected environment of dental schools. Extramural programs offer students the opportunity to develop the ability to be effective in a different and challenging environment, while gaining experience in an interesting way.Limitations Non-responding schools can cause significant bias and error, as we had only a fairly low response rate (16.4%) from 506 dental schools in 65 countries. We also included non-industrialized countries in our study, with less probability of teaching GD, which led to fewer responses. We decided to keep these data to raise awareness about the need to develop GD even in populations where the elderly have shorter lifespans, to improve quality of life at any age.Another limitation of this study was the lack of information of how many dental schools don't teach GD. Moreover, we could not find an accurate complete listing of all dental schools in the world, and the many schools not included in the survey may have contributed to the bias in our data.Also, the questionnaire was written in English and this could have been a barrier in countries where the English language is not widely spoken, and where school faculty members may have had to use translating tools.5. Conclusions Considering the limitations of this brief survey, it is possible to conclude that each surveyed country has a different dental education system, and geriatric dentistry education will reflect this diversity. Teaching GD has become more common among the surveyed dental schools. It also seems dental education varies by length of time and content of their curriculum. Most of the surveyed dental schools had GD as a required subject in their syllabus. Our results suggest the treatment of geriatric patients by dental students is still very limited and needs to be expanded. We believe specialized dental geriatricians can be key healthcare providers and consultants for the aging population who may have different levels of dependency. More research is needed to examine the impact of teaching GD,especially the clinical care of medically compromised frail older adults. Future research may explore whether the GD teaching in its current form is sufficient to prepare dental students in treating geriatric patients, or if a geriatric specialization is needed.Supplementary Materials:The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/13/4682/s1,Table S1: Curriculum content in geriatric dentistry in Dental Schools questionnaire; Table S2: Inclusion of geriatric dentistry teaching into curriculum over time, expressed as a percentage from total responses; Table S3: Comparison Of dedicated gerodontology teaching formats in over 40 years, expressed as a percentage from total responses;Table S4: Topics covered by lectures and seminars: (A) traditional topics (oral medicine/prosthodontics) and(B) non-traditional topics (gerontologic), expressed as a percentage from total responses; Table S5: Funding of geriatric undergraduate programs, expressed as a percentage from total responses; Table S6: Remote sites of clinical geriatric care, expressed as a percentage from total responses; Table S7: Department responsible for teaching didactic and clinical geriatric dentistry, expressed as a percentage from total responses.Author Contributions:Conceptualization, I.X. and J.J.M.; methodology, I.X.; software, L.P.; validation, I.X., R.E.,L.P., J.B., V.M.; formal analysis, I.X., L.P.; investigation, I.X., R.E., L.P., J.B., V.M., J.R., A.S.D., J.J.M.; resources,I.X.; data curation, I.X., J.P.; writing—original draft preparation, I.X.; writing—review and editing, I.X., R.E., L.P.,J.B., V.M., J.R., A.S.D., J.J.M.; visualization, I.X.; supervision, I.X., R.E., L.P., J.B., V.M., J.R., A.S.D., J.J.M.; project administration, I.X., R.E., L.P., J.B., V.M., J.R., A.S.D., J.J.M.

Working With Interpreters as a Team in Health Care (WITH Care) Curriculum Tool Kit for Oral Health Professions,"Ann Woll, MS, Karin K. Quick, DDS, PhD, Cristiano Mazzei, MA, Tehout Selameab, MPP, Jane L. Miller, PhD","Introduction: Limited English proficiency (LEP) patients face multiple care barriers and disproportionate risks for communication errors. Working with trained interpreters as a health care team can improve communication and drive high-quality care for LEP patients. Simulation and interprofessional education provide key strategies to address the critical training gap that exists at the intersection of patient safety, interprofessional practice, and cultural competence. Methods:Using action research principles across 16 months, we created a 3.5-hour simulation-based training for oral health and interpreting learners. The curriculum included profession-specific orientations with didactic and experiential content, three immersive simulations using start-stop-rewind methodology, virtual scenarios, and summary reflection discussions. A comprehensive tool kit facilitated curriculum implementation and standardization. Results: Forty-nine students from dentistry (first- through third-year predoctoral), dental hygiene, and dental therapy participated in this elective training during the 2017-2018 academic year; as required training, 126 third-year dental students participated in fall 2018. Students’ familiarity with provider and interpreter best practices, appreciation of challenges faced by LEP patients, and confidence in skills working with spoken language interpreters increased. For all evaluation parameters, pre- and post survey ratings were statistically significant (chi-square tests,p<.001). Discussion: The curriculum efficiently and effectively develops oral health and interpreting learners’ ability to work as a team with LEP patients. Curriculum design and resources address key barriers to feasibility and sustainability. The curriculum in forms communication across all patient populations, revealing that getting by with partial understanding can be insufficient for any patient and any health care team.

Articulate the value of working with a trained interpreter in the patient-provider-interpreter relationship.2. Articulate the complexity of the patient-provider-interpreter relationship.3. Describe challenges for limited English proficiency (LEP)patients in accessing and receiving health care.4. Identify challenges and complexities of working as an interpreter in patient encounters in oral health care. 5. Identify challenges for oral health professionals in providing care in interpreter-mediated patient encounters.6. Articulate ethical and legal implications of providing care to LEP patients without trained interpreters (for oral health learners only).7. Use the INTERPRET framework to work more effectively with interpreters (for oral health learners only).8. Interpret common dental terminology and concepts in the patient’s spoken language (for interpreting learners only).Introduction Effective communication is central to providing safe, high-quality care for patients.Communication problems have been attributed to the majority of serious adverse events and poor outcomes,2-4 and not surprisingly, limited English proficiency (LEP) patients experience a significantly higher proportion of adverse events causing harm, are negatively impacted more frequently by communication error, and experience more serious harm from those errors than English-speaking patients.Medical errors have a profound impact on the healthcare team as well; team members can become the second victims.6 Health care professionals often employ a variety of strategies to get by without the use of a trained interpreter, including using family members or friends, untrained staff, or providers with limited skills in the patient’s language to provide patient care.7,8Some do not use an interpreter at all.2 This creates opportunities for misunderstanding, omission, and error that increase threats to patient safety.For LEP patients, trained interpreters provide the safest communication experience and are linked to the highest patient experience ratings and care outcomes.3,9,10 However, the presence of a trained interpreter does not assure the essential team performance at the foundation of high-quality patient care.11The type of team performance required to mitigate risk and reduce adverse events requires a deeper understanding of how to work together, through an emphasis on the coordination between team members and on the integration of all team members as equals. It requires approaching the problem with the expectation that the interpreter is truly part of the health careteam.A critical training gap currently exists at the intersection of patient safety, interprofessional practice, and cultural competence(Figure 1), and addressing this gap requires developing healthcare teams that can work together effectively. To do that, training needs to target key power differentials currently inherent in the patient-provider-interpreter triad. The expectations and pre existing perceptions of each team member, including the patient, impact how they each seek help and speak up about concerns, which has profound implications for how care is provided.12,13 As a profession, interpreting currently lacks recognized national program accreditation for all languages and a clear national regulatory framework, and the ad hoc work structure for many interpreters also leads to significant differences in pay among providers on the health care team.Additionally, interpreters are often from the same marginalized communities as the LEP patients. These factors can contribute to a false sense of inferiority on the part of the interpreter—inthe eyes of both the health care provider and the interpreter.Perhaps more importantly, the LEP patient is often disempowered to speak up in the triad although he or she has the key answers necessary for safe, high-quality care.14The desired goals of improved teamwork through training can only be achieved if professional identity and hidden status are explicit from the start.15 Creating an interprofessional education (IPE) context to understand and address this training gap can provide an important contribution to existing curricular innovations.16-18IPE principles frame an approach that addresses patient safety,team coordination, and underappreciated power differentials in the patient-provider-interpreter team. This can help equalize interpreters’ status as team members, cement a professional identity in their own eyes, and elevate expectations aboutwhat interpreters can do. Interpreting to ensure effective communication requires more than simply relaying what is said.Meaning often needs to be negotiated among participants.Furthermore, being able to read silence, body language, facial expressions, and verbal tone and understand or anticipate any communication gap is essential—and with LEP patients,health literacy becomes an even greater obstacle to effective communication.4,19 Interpreters can play a key role in bridging the gap from the patient’s lack of experience with health care and serve as a vital advocate for the patient.20 Interprofessional training can help disrupt the notion that superficial communication with LEP patients and families is sufficient. Instead of relying on addressing patients’ needs with limited information obtained by getting the gist of what's said, team members can be trained to function in a deeper,coordinated way. They can leverage patient involvement in the delivery of care.Simulation is a key educational strategy that allows interprofessional training to augment existing systems-based interventions by providing individuals with opportunities to practice working together, apply knowledge and processes, as a Team in Health Care) curriculum using action research methodology 28 to create an efficient, simulation-based training addressing this critical need for providers and interpreters and to improve care to LEP patients, focusing initially on oral healthcare. By embracing an IPE approach, we aimed to create a novel curriculum that would uniquely engage interpreting students.Additionally, we aimed to create a comprehensive tool kit that would enable external audiences to easily and effectively implement this curriculum.Methods Curriculum Development and Implementation We developed a simulation-based 3.5-hour foundation training for oral health students and interpreting students working together as a healthcare team. The training was developed over a 16-month period (December 2016-April 2018) and evolved through six separate elective iterations using action research principles.29 This collaborative approach was characterized by a continual process of evaluation and reflection that informed iterative design.28 Our original work emerged from a partnership between the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry, the university’s simulation team, and a local community college translating and interpreting program and involved the participation of 89 oral health professions students (programs:predoctoral dental, dental hygiene, and dental therapy) and 41 translating and interpreting students.The developed training was then embedded in the University Of Minnesota School of Dentistry as a required curriculum and provided to third-year predoctoral dental students in fall 2018.The required training was offered a total of six times to reach 126 students. Each training session accommodated up to 24 dental students and required for facilitators, three interpreters,and three bilingual standardized patients (SPs). The training utilized three simulation rooms and a classroom in our simulation facilities, although simulation facility features were not required.Addressing Language Concordance As an educational strategy and to establish language-concordant patient-interpreter pairs for the simulations, interpreting learners filled the interpreter and patient roles. For the six elective iterations, half of the interpreting learners were trained as SPy to participate in the simulations with a language-concordant peeras the interpreter. Translating and Interpreting program faculty provided extra-credit incentives for their students to participate in this elective experience.For the six required training iterations, an alternate recruitment strategy assured language-concordant pairs. Trained interpreters served as interpreters in the simulations, with bilingual SPs actingas patients. These trained interpreters joined their patient partnerin training to become familiar with the workshop format and content. Several trained interpreters were recruited from the SPprogram, and others were recruited through relationships with interpreter training programs. Additional recruitment sources were considered but not needed, including local interpreting associations, health care systems’ interpreting networks,international student offices, public school systems, and refugee resettlement or international aid programs.Training FormatThe training began with separate orientations for the oral health professions students and the interpreters. Orientation Focused on learning about the other profession and profession-specific frameworks to facilitate interprofessional teamwork. The Interpreter orientation also included patient training to achieve desired performance standardization for the SP role; exposure to specialized vocabulary was a simultaneous goal for the interpreter role. In alignment with established best practices, S&P methodology was adapted to balance the needs for sustainability and replicability with the rigor of standardization.30 Oral health professions students were divided into four groups(with four to six students per group) to rotate through fourstations. Three of the stations were immersive simulationsof language-mediated interactions with SPs and interpretersand were facilitated in a fishbowl, or hot-seat, format usingstart-stop-rewind methodology. This format allowed learnersto take turns practicing skills, observing peers, reflecting onperformance, and giving and receiving feedback.31The fourthstation consisted of a facilitated discussion of virtual scenariosconsidering legal and ethical issues in working with interpretersand LEP patients. After the final station, learners participated in summary reflectiondiscussions, first as uniprofessional groups and then as a fullinterprofessional group. The training concluded with a shortpresentation to promote ongoing reflection and transfer to actualcare.Figure 2details the training format.Tool Kit ResourcesWe created tool kit resources to standardize the curriculum,provide instruction for facilitators, and enable implementation asan IPE or uniprofessional activity. In considering transferability,we anticipated potential challenges accessing interpretertraining programs, SPs, simulation programs and facilities,and other expert knowledge. Facilitation of the orientations,virtual scenarios for discussion, and conclusion was supportedthrough suggested content in the training materials, althoughadditional facilitation strategies and instructions were providedin the tool kit. Simulation facilitation required specific skills andmethodological understanding. Thus, we developed materials tosupport a separate 2-hour simulation facilitator training.The following tools were used in advance of the training toprepare for implementation:The implementation guide (Appendix A) provided anoverview of the curriculum and implementation options,instructions for implementing the different training sections,and instructions for facilitators for each training section,which included reviewing some of the materials usedduring the training (listed below). Within this guide, in-room reference tools were provided for use during facilitation tosimplify station flow and promote learning. The LearnerFrequently Asked Questions and Glossary sectionsprovided additional resources facilitators could use at anytime.The simulation facilitator training presentation (Appendix B)was a PowerPoint presentation with suggested narrationprovided as part of facilitator preparation in advance of thesimulations.The simulation facilitation demonstration video(Appendix C) was a video providing additional trainingactivities for simulation facilitator preparation.The following tools were used during the orientation for oralhealth learners:The orientation for oral health learners (Appendix D) wasa PowerPoint presentation for oral health learners withsuggested narration for the facilitator.The memory exercises (Appendix E) were a text documentwith two sets of instructions for oral health learners tocomplete an activity in their orientation.The INTERPRET video (Appendix F) was a videopresentation of the INTERPRET (introduce, negotiate,treat, enable, recognize, prepare, relay, empower, trust)framework used with oral health and interpreting learnersin their respective orientations.The INTERPRET pocket card (Appendix G) was a referencetool provided to the oral health learners during theirorientations to use in the simulations. The pocket cardreviewed the INTERPRET framework.The following tools were used during the orientation forinterpreters and patients:The orientation for interpreters and patients (Appendix H)was a PowerPoint presentation for interpreting learners,trained interpreters, and SPs with suggested narration forthe facilitator.The dental terminology for interpreters document(Appendix I) was a reference tool with common dentalterminology provided to the interpreting learners toprepare for and use during the simulations.Simulation 1 SP Case: Bad Breath (Appendix J) was a textdocument provided to SPs and interpreting learners to helpprepare these individuals to be the SP for this case.Simulation 2 SP Case: Caries (Appendix K) was a textdocument provided to SPs and interpreting learners to helpprepare these individuals to be the SP for this case.Simulation 3 SP Case: Wisdom Tooth (Appendix L) was atext document provided to SPs and interpreting learners tohelp prepare these individuals to be the SP for this case.The following tools were used during the stations (i.e., the threeimmersive simulations and virtual scenarios):The virtual scenarios for discussion video (Appendix M)was a video presentation of five vignettes for oral healthlearners to discuss during the virtual scenarios station, withprovided responses from professionals in dentistry andinterpreting.The Simulation 1 learner instructions (Appendix N) were atext document provided to oral health learners at the startof Simulation 1 listing pertinent patient information andtasks for this station.The Simulation 1 patient history questionnaire (Appendix O)was a text document provided to oral health learners atthe start of Simulation 1 detailing additional patient historyinformation for this station.The Simulation 2 learner instructions (Appendix P) were atext document provided to oral health learners at the startof Simulation 2 listing pertinent patient information andtasks for this station.The Simulation 2 patient history questionnaire (Appendix Q)was a text document provided to oral health learners atthe start of Simulation 2 detailing additional patient historyinformation for this station.The Simulation 3 learner instructions (Appendix R) were atext document provided to oral health learners at the startof Simulation 3 listing pertinent patient information andtasks for this station.The Simulation 3 patient history questionnaire (Appendix S)was a text document provided to oral health learners atthe start of Simulation 3 detailing additional patient historyinformation for this station.The following tool could be used as an alternate activity tothe simulations during the training, as a strategy for utilizingthe curriculum despite critical access limitations to language-concordant interpreter-patient pairs:The simulation demonstration video (Appendix T) was avideo showing a reenactment of Simulation 1 and portionsof subsequent facilitated discussions with simulatedlearners.The following tool was used during the conclusion:The conclusion presentation (Appendix U) was aPowerPoint presentation for all learners to conclude the training experience, with suggested narration for thefacilitator provided to structure this section of the training.Evaluation StrategyA pre- and posttest evaluation design was used with oral healthprofessions students across all training implementations. Surveyitems were developed in consultation with subject matter expertsincluding interpreting, dentistry, and simulation faculty and aprogram evaluator. Items were further refined based on datacollected in early iterations of the training. Surveys includedseven items with 5-point rating scales (1=not at all familiarornot at all confident,5=extremely familiarorextremelyconfident). Evaluation parameters included familiarity withbest practices for working with interpreters and LEP patients,experience of LEP patients, and confidence in patient-provider-interpreter communication skills. Descriptive and comparativestatistics were used to analyze these data.Learner AssessmentLearner assessment was formative, consisting of facilitator andpeer feedback. Facilitator training materials provided examplesof learner performance elements for discussion. Facilitators Identified additional dynamics between oral health providers,interpreters, and patients meriting discussion.Results As an elective experience, 49 oral health professions (dental,dental hygiene, and dental therapy) students participated in the WITH Care trainings over three offerings during the 2017-2018 academic year.29 During fall semester 2018, 126 third-year dental students participated in the required training(scheduled in groups of 21) over six sessions embedded in the formal curriculum. Descriptive and comparative statistics are summarized in Table 1(in Table 1, data from the fall 2017-spring 2018 trainings were reported previously and in full inQuick, Selameab, Woll, Mazzei, and Miller,29 whereas data from the fall 2018 trainings have not been previously reported). Forall evaluation parameters, pre- and post survey ratings were found to be statistically significant (chi-square tests,p<.001).Students’ familiarity with provider and interpreter best practices,appreciation of challenges faced by LEP patients, and confidence in skills working with spoken-language interpreters increased.These results were consistent across the 2017-2018 elective experiences and the fall 2018 required trainings.Discussion The WITH Care curriculum is an effective foundational training aimed at developing oral health and interpreting students’abilities to work together as a healthcare team to provide care for LEP patients. Data from the elective sessions verify the effectiveness of the curriculum design,29 and data from subsequent required training iterations for third-year dental students further establish the training’s impact. Additionally,data from the elective iterations speak to the curriculum’effectiveness when utilized deliberately as an IPE activity. Data From the subsequent required training demonstrate a similar impact with the uniprofessional training format, using trained interpreters. The curriculum also fulfills key recommendations from the Guide for Hospitals to “develop strategies and systems to prevent medical errors among LEP patients” by specifically addressing training on team communication, interpreter use,cultural competency, and advocacy.Through action research and an IPE framework, we developed a simulation-based curriculum uniting historically distant professions and transforming training. The integration of multiple educational methodologies supports a vital learner-and patient-centered approach. Key design features enable learners to deliberately practice skills, negotiate relationships between professions, and achieve new understanding of the possibility of team care with the patient at the center. Separate Orientations provide just-in-time training content that learners in each profession can intentionally apply during the stations. This Content focuses on LEP patient disparities, professional roles,and profession-specific strategies to improve team performance.Reflection and discussion deliberately target these concepts.The fishbowl strategy and use of start-stop-rewind for the simulations are logistically pragmatic for larger groups and also provide essential opportunities for oral health participants to learn through observation. With these strategies, the simulations emphasize skill repetition alternating with continuous feedback from multiple faculty facilitators. These shorter simulation bursts are distinctly different from more traditional simulation uses but are similar to the emerging strategy of rapid cycle deliberate practice.32 Teaming in this format is different, too, as learners are empowered to provide feedback to one another.Case construction across the three simulations is deliberately complementary. Rather than challenging learners with distinctly different clinical situations, similar learner tasks provide opportunities to use subsequent stations as do-overs to build on skills acquired in the previous station. The virtual scenarios provide a pause from performance to reflect on related legal and ethical considerations, thereby enhancing emphasis on transferability of training to actual practice.Reflection is a primary feature of the curriculum pedagogy, and its impact is evident in data indicating learners’ responses following the training. Their self-reported increases in knowledge and skills concerning interpreting and interprofessional teamwork suggest a transformative shift from unconscious incompetence to awareness of their limitations—that is, a new realization for learners about what they did not know, what they still don't know, and what they have just gained. The integration of facilitated reflection provides the key modeling that Epstein Suggests is required for developing mindful practice. Mindful Practice—developing the habits of mind to continually examine one’s actions and thoughts—is integral to being aware of one's own strengths and limitations, biases, and values.27 Mindfulness Is key to adapting one’s functioning as a team member.Using an IPE intervention to address the training gap in providing safe, high-quality care to LEP patients achieves unique and essential outcomes. This IPE training helps surface the role and identity of the interpreter, which have a central impact on how these teams function. Confronting individuals’ expectations and addressing value and status require more than telling people to speak up or declaring their equality on the team; they require practicing those behaviors and receiving feedback confirming their effect. The training establishes a shared mental model for interpreters and oral health learners and identifies patient safety as their common goal, helping break down professional silos that can prevent cooperative learning. The development of this curriculum as an interprofessional endeavor from its inception has also resulted in key discoveries.For our research team, no single profession held all the answers. Instead, design decisions and content choices were discovered through true research collaboration. Our vision of distinctly separate uni professional and interprofessional training formats has been challenged. That is, the process of the oral health and interpreting participants practicing skills and reflecting together has blurred any distinction between professional and trainee. By embracing a stance of reflective inquiry, we are all professionals and learners simultaneously.Thus, even when trained interpreters participate in the required trainings (i.e., instead of using learners in training programs), the interpreters’ understanding of the patient-provider-interpreter team is expanded—they, too, are learners. Similarly, facilitators who are seasoned faculty members experience important discoveries by using genuine inquiry to explore team dynamics simulations. Learning from, with, and about one another can transform how we work together, both as learners and as professionals.Many concepts about effective communication uncovered during these trainings are applicable across all patient populations.The simulations shed light on problematic choices made by oral health learners to limit communication with LEP patients for efficiency and revealed learners’ deeper assumptions about what the patient actually understands and needs to know. This hidden curriculum addresses patient-centered care and reveals not only where communication can derail but also that getting by with partial understanding can be insufficient for any patient.Expanding the audience for this training was an initial goal. The Comparability of learner evaluation data across the elective and required iterations points to the applicability of the curriculum fora range of oral health learners and training levels. The successful implementation of the IPE format (i.e., using interpreting students)and the uniprofessional format (i.e., using trained interpreters)also supports broader utilization for interpreter training.Additionally, this curriculum does not require any pre work for any participant, including SPs. All knowledge content is deliberately embedded in profession-specific learner orientations, resulting in one efficient training experience.Curriculum design and tool kit resources also address key barriers to feasibility and sustainability in order to enhance replicability with external audiences. Training presentations and videos capture required expertise in dentistry, interpreting, and simulation and minimize requirements for specific facilitator expertise. Successfully using trained interpreters and other bilingual individuals as SPs helps address language-related recruitment challenges. By adapting SP methodology to meet these unique training needs, we have been better able to accommodate the range of SPs’ experience levels, support any potential lack of SP trainer access, and complete training during limited orientation time—all helping advance SP methodology.Additionally, case materials have been developed to assure easein SP training and performance while remaining clinically relevant.Developing simulation curriculum dissemination strategies that minimize required resources and expertise is an innovation that supports the advancement of the simulation profession.Despite these adaptations to support implementation, simulation may remain an insurmountable barrier for some audiences. An Alternate activity has been developed for groups that are unable to facilitate simulations but that may benefit from the curriculum.Although not equivalent to the live simulation experience, the alternate activity provides video reenactments of simulations and mini-debriefings so that viewers can observe skills in action andreflect actively on the impact to patient care.The WITH Care curriculum is a formative, foundational training used with learners in oral health professions programs at one university. Although replicability with external audiences wasa driver in tool kit development, the curriculum has not been validated in other institutions or settings. Skill transferability to actual patient care has also not yet been measured. Additional Advanced training is needed to more fully address deficits in LEP patient care attributed to poor communication.This curriculum is a starting point for providing essential training to work with interpreters as part of the healthcare team. Thistraining meets the Interprofessional Education Collaborative Competency criteria required by academic accrediting bodies(Table 2). Immediate future directions for this work include expanding training across the professions and adding advanced modules to allow learners to practice increasingly complex and high-stakes communication. Practicing oral health professionals may also benefit from adopting this training. We recognize the significance of work in this domain and acknowledge the need to grow a community of practice and expand the research team beyond our institutions, so that additional interventions can be developed collaboratively. Additionally, initial data collection focused on oral health learner outcomes; paying equal attention to the training impact on interpreting learners is necessary.This work points to the importance of continuing to include interpreters not only on the healthcare team but in developing training strategies that equally serve the needs of all learners.Together, we can better understand the landscape of training and practice and develop educational opportunities that improve care for all patients.Conclusion The WITH Care curriculum is an efficient, effective, and flexible pIPE intervention that provides foundational skills for oral health learners to work as a team with interpreters. These team skills are at the heart of effective communication with LEP patients and are essential to improving patient safety and delivering high-quality care.

Implementing virtual OSCE using an open-source online interactive 3D library,"Ahmed Mahrous DDS, MS Rawa Al Ammari DDS, MHI, MS Amira Elgreatly DDS, MS",-,"1 PROBLEM The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted dental education.1Dentistryisahands-on profession;likewise,dental education has always relied on providing hands-on material to dental students to aid in the visualization of complex structures such as dental anatomy or dental FIGURE 1 Example of a molar from the open source virtual library prostheses. Due to social distancing guidelines imposed by the pandemic, students have limited access to those materials. Consequently, it has become challenging to deliver information to dental students. It has also been challenging to deliver Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs)2 that rely on physical material like casts or extracted natural teeth. At the University of Iowa College of Dentistry & Dental Clinics, students learn dental anatomy through a combination of lectures and hands-on examination of a physical library of extracted natural teeth that are handled in accordance with the CDC guidelines. Several FORCEs are conducted during the dental anatomy course to assess student competence in tooth identification. When the stay-at-home orders took effect, our ability to teach tooth identification and conduct an OSCE was compromised.A solution to virtualize natural extracted teeth and make them accessible to a wide range of devices was necessary.2 SOLUTION Natural teeth were scanned using an open architecture scanner (3shape, Copenhagen, Denmark) then textured and detailed using the open-source 3D content-creation program; Blender (Blender Foundation, Amsterdam,Netherlands). The 3D models were meticulously detailed and textured to faithfully reproduce natural tooth anatomy(Figure1). In order to facilitate the accessibility to the 3d Models across a range of devices, a Website was created to contain the 3D models.The Dental Atlas3(Figure 2)waslaunched free,online resource to facilitate the viewing of 3D models of permanent and deciduous dental anatomy. The Web-based format requires no downloads and facilitates accessibility dueto compatibility with desktop and mobile devices and all available operating systems.In order to conduct the OSCE, a combination of the 3d Models, Canvas (Instructure Inc, Salt Lake City, UT, USA)and Zoom (Zoom Video Communications Inc. San Jose,CA, USA) is used. A list of links to non-identifiable 3d Models is created. The links are embedded into Canvas Online tests/quizzes. A Zoom session is started alongside the Canvas test/quiz and the instructor moderates the timing of each question. Once all questions are conducted the students are to submit all quizzes (Figure3).3 RESULTS The use of the dental atlas virtual 3D models has been found to be a useful tool in the virtual delivery of tooth identification content as well as the OSCE examination.In addition to improving spatial learning of complex structures,4the use of virtual 3D models overcomes some disadvantages of using natural teeth. Natural extracted teeth are often fractured, lost, or damaged. Natural teeth incur cost and effort to acquire and sanitize according to the CDC guidelines.5 Due to the positive feedback from students and faculty, and the success of using the dental atlas Website virtual 3D models in student instruction and conducting the virtual OSCE, there may be value in transitioning to virtual online tooth models post pandemic.ORCID Ahmed Mahrous DDS,MShttps://orcid.org/0000-0001-5436-8247",-,"1.

Preface Changing Face of Prosthodontics,"Lisa A. Lang, DDS, MS, MBA Lily T. Garcı ́a, DDS, MS",-,"Over the last three decades, advances in technology changed the world around us.Technological advances influence our personal lives and that of our patients, occurring at a faster pace due to changes in communication technology that drive how society accessed information and influences societal demands. The exponential advances in dentistry, in particular, in Prosthodontics, reflect increasing demands for optimal esthetic results, high-quality precision, shorter treatment time, treatment decisions based on predictable outcomes, and evidence-based treatment approaches driving research and technology. While rehabilitating patients to a restored state of function and comfort remains a mainstay, patients expect to have improved quality of life and highly esthetic restorations with the latest biomaterials and technologies.In order for general dentists and prosthodontists to fulfill the needs of their patients,each must commit professionally to understanding foundational knowledge of classic prosthodontic principles and practice and translating those fundamental principles in an era of advancing digital technologies and biomaterials. This integration must occur in all areas of the discipline. The technology explosion has resulted in improved materials, practices, and technologies that allow us to evaluate, diagnose, and treat patients in an environment that did not exist 40 years ago.As masters of diagnosis and treatment planning, we now have the tools to do this in a digital world. We have the ability to image the patient from pretreatment to completion of treatment, evaluating, diagnosing, planning, and executing treatment virtually. We May now not only plan the surgical placement of implants but also execute the surgical placement by means of surgical guides made using digital technologies. Implants,which were once limited to the edentulous mandible, are now used in every imaginable type of rehabilitation. With this unlimited use in more complex situations comes an increase in complications. The purpose of this issue is to provide fundamental knowledge in current topics of interest affecting the dynamic discipline and specialty of prosthodontics. As guest editors, we would like to thank our friends and colleagues from around North America who so graciously agreed to contribute their time and efforts to bring the reader the best possible science and clinical rationale in prosthodontics. This issue of Dental Clinics of North America Represents the highest levels of expertise that spans the new and old disciplines of prosthodontics: fixed, removable,and implant prosthodontics, the periodontal-prosthodontics connection, ceramic and adhesive technologies, sleep apnea, various aspects of the digital workflow, and there-CAT evidence-based dentistry.We would like to express our deepest gratitude to our colleagues who have demonstrated a level of professional commitment to excellence which is reflected in this publication. It is a privilege to experience a unique and rare occasion to collaborate with this group of prominent individuals. Finally, we would like to thank Laura Fisher, John Vassallo, and the Elsevier staff for all their help during the process and Dental Clinics of North America For affording us this wonderful opportunity.",-,-,0
AN EVIDENCE-BASED PROTOCOL FOR IMMEDIATE REHABILITATION OF THE EDENTULOUS PATIENT,"George V. Duello, DDS, MS, FACD","Context: A procedure using 4 dental fixtures with an immediate-loaded prosthesis for totally edentulous patients is the focus of an evidence-based analysis that uses modern methodologies to review an innovative clinical technique. The long-term outcomes for this surgical and prosthetic treatment for previously or newly eden-tulated patients by clinical teams worldwide, as well as the author’s clinical personal data in a referral-based private practice, are reported in this investigation. Evidence Acquisition: An independent research dentist performed the literature review using terms that would identify articles commensurate with this article. The search years for keywords were limited to 2010 and 2011 because the purpose of the article was limited to current thinking and evidence on this specific technique. In this article, the author elected to restrict the literature search to journals that are commonly read and received in his clinical practice on a monthly basis. Because of the specific nature of this procedure, all historical references to the “all-on-4” procedure were also included in the database inquiries. Evidence Synthesis: The literature search revealed that the investigated technique has been reported worldwide by multiple authors using retrospective clinical analysis. In the maxillary jaw, the range of implants placed was 27 to 980 fixtures with 1 to 7 years of follow-up, demonstrating a cumulative implant success rate range of 92.5% to 100%. The mandibular arch demonstrated cumulative success rates of 93.8% to 100% with 1 to 10 years of follow-up with a range of 18 to 980 fixtures being placed. The investigator’s own personal clinical statistics compared favorably with other clinical teams, with a total of 120 fixtures being placed in both jaws with 6 years of follow-up with a cumulative survival implant success rate of 100%. Continuous stability of the definitive final prosthesis was above 99% in the largest reported review and 100% for this author’s private practice.Conclusion: Based on extensive reporting by multiple clinicians, the technique investigated is grounded in good bioengineering basic science, and demonstrates long-term clinical outcomes that can provide highly predictable long-term prosthetic stability for the edentulous patient. This highly focused critically appraised review of individual articles using 4 implants to support a fixed dental prosthesis provides clinicians and patients with a protocol that conservatively and immediately reduces the morbidity associated with the loss of teeth and removable prostheses traditional used to negate edentulism. Keywords: All-on-Four, immediate loading, fixed screw retained prosthesis, Procera, major alveoloplasty, all acrylic prosthesis, titanium framework, dental implants, dental implant surgery, NobelGuide, guided implant surgery, malleable guide, cone beam computerized tomography, full arch immediate loading, implant prosthesis","introDuCtion Despite the acknowledged biological phenomena of osseointegration, the field of implantology has also been presented with controversies by innovative clinicians and/or by the proposals of representative implant manufacturers. A short list of these discussions has focused on implant surface alterations, macro- and micro-geometric designs, implant body–abutment connections, and computer-enhanced implant placement. Many journal editorials, focused expert panel discussions, and entire dental conferences have been dedicated to the justification of various implant technologies. Today’s environment for basic research is different from the past hours spent in the library developing a literature review for a master’s thesis with marking note cards, searching bookshelves, and talking to mentors. The advent of Internet searches in computer databases, international Web-based learning, and even Facebook has accelerated the access to scientific information at a pace never seen in academia and clinical practice.Although the pace and volume of scientific information has dramatically increased, the basic procedures of scientific investigation, observation, and reporting remain the same regardless of the source of the media. The American Dental Association has defined evidence-based dentistry as an “approach to oral health care that requires the judicious integration of systematic assessment of clinical relevant scientific evidence relating to the patient’s oral and medical condition and history, together with the dentist’s clinical expertise, and the patient’s treatment needs and preferences.” The evidence-based process has been described in the epidemiological and scientific literature.1 It is the intent of this author to use the principles of scientific investigation obtained more than 30 years ago during a master’s thesis in graduate school along with the new tools of evidence-based dentistry to examine emerging changes in implant dentistry that are confounding the principles put forth by Dr Branemark (www.nobelbiocare.com/en_us/news-events/news/2012/p-i-br-nemark-celebrates-the-dual-anniversaries-of-osseointegration-with-nobel-biocare_7.aspx) more than 60 years ago. Traditionalists have vehemently condemned these innovative procedures, whereas early adaptors, manufacturers, and some entrepreneurs have promoted this concept as a significant advancement for patients who are about to become edentulous or those who are suffering from it. A procedure using 4 dental fixtures with an immediate-loaded prosthesis for the totally edentulous patient is the targeted topic of this article (Fig. 1).2 StEpS 1 AnD 2. DEFining thE protoCol AnD SyStEMAtiCAlly SEArChing thE litErAturE The clinical protocol investigated in this article was originally reported by Malo and colleagues in 2003 in a retrospective pilot study of 44 patients with 176 immediately loaded implants in the mandible using a procedure labeled the “all-on-4” technique (Fig. 2).The following is a description commonly used for this procedure:1. The placement of 4 dental implants in the premaxilla or anterior mandible with the 2 most distal fixtures tilted to 60 to 45 degrees and the 2 additional anterior implants that are in a vertical position that all are conjoined with a fixed screw–retained all-acrylic prosthesis preferably under immediate load. The surgical procedure for the technique can be untaken with traditional full-thickness flaps using a malleable surgical guide (Figs. 3 and 4) or with the use of a stereo lithographic computer-aided surgical guide on a previously edentulous jaw (Fig. 5). 2. After primary stability of the dental fixtures have been verified by various subjective and objective clinical introDuCtion Despite the acknowledged biological phenomena of osseointegration, the field of implantology has also been presented with controversies by innovative clinicians and/or by the proposals of representative implant manufacturers. A short list of these discussions has focused on implant surface alterations, macro- and micro-geometric designs, implant body–abutment connections, and computer-enhanced implant placement. Many journal editorials, focused expert panel discussions, and entire dental conferences have been dedicated to the justification of various implant technologies. Today’s environment for basic research is different from the past hours spent in the library developing a literature review for a master’s thesis with marking note cards, searching bookshelves, and talking to mentors. The advent of Internet searches in computer databases, international Web-based learning, and even Facebook has accelerated the access to scientific information at a pace never seen in academia and clinical practice.Although the pace and volume of scientific information has dramatically increased, the basic procedures of scientific investigation, observation, and reporting remain the same regardless of the source of the media. The American Dental Association has defined evidence-based dentistry as an “approach to oral health care that requires the judicious integration of systematic assessment of clinical relevant scientific evidence relating to the patient’s oral and medical condition and history, together with the dentist’s clinical expertise, and the patient’s treatment needs and preferences.” The evidence-based process has been described in the epidemiological and scientific literature.1 It is the intent of this author to use the principles of scientific investigation obtained more than 30 years ago during a master’s thesis in graduate school along with the new tools of evidence-based dentistry to examine emerging changes measurements, the multiunit transmucosal abutments are placed for a fixed screw-retained provisional prosthesis (Figs. 6 and 7). 3. The fabrication of the provisional prosthesis can occur directly in the patient’s mouth at the chair or fabricated indirectly in the dental laboratory for placement within 24 hours of the initial implant insertion. 4. Following several months of healing under controlled occlusal loads and after confirmation of osseointegration, the patient is traditionally appointed for fabrication of the definitive screw-retained fixed prosthesis, which consists of an acrylic prosthesis reinforced by a milled titanium bar fabricated during a 3- to 5-appointment prosthetic proto-col (Figs. 8, 9, and 10).The purported benefits of the protocol are reduction of the distal cantilever length, reduction in the number of implants needed for a fixed full-arch prosthesis, and increased in-terimplant distances with few fixtures, which increases the effectiveness of personal oral hygiene around the prosthesis, ease of fabrication, simplification of surgical and prosthetic procedures, and greater patient acceptance. Opposition to the technique from academic facility and/or implant clinicians consists of a statement concerning the potential liability of the prosthesis and patient when a single fixture out of 4 is lost during healing and/or the definite prosthesis wear, inadequate protection from the forces of occlusal loading during mastication to the implant and/or prosthesis, overuse of the technique when alternative surgical and prosthetics are available, and personal commentary from traditionalists and iconic implant lecturers that oppose the protocol for scientific, philosophical, political, and financial considerations.3,4The gold standard for the successful rehabilitation for a totally edentulous patient was originally established by Professor Branemark 5 in his landmark article published in 1977 describing a 10-year history of treatment in totally edentulous patients. His method placed 4 to 6 implants in the mandibular intraforaminal bone or in the premaxilla anterior to the maxillary sinuses. The final bilaterally cantilevered screw-retained fixed prosthesis is placed after a 2-stage non immediate-loading healing schedule for at least 3 months in the mandible and at least 6 months in the maxilla. This procedure has been reported in the dental literature by multiple authors over many years as one of the most successful long-term outcomes in the history of dentistry. Dr Branemark’s6 published implant survival rated at 10 years for the mandible was 88.4% with 4 implants supporting the prosthesis and 93.2% with 6 implants under the prosthesis. In the maxillary arch, he reported 78.3% with 4 implants and 80.3% with 6 implants. Subsequent articles by Adele and Branemark confirmed the success of these procedures in longer time periods.3 Two Cochrane database systematic reviews have confirmed the long-term success of these procedures from multiple authors and clinicians.7,8The Branemark approach in the anterior mandible of an edentulous patient is the measuring stick and standard by which any emerging technique must be compared in clinical practice. The appropriate use of an evidence-based approach would be a prudent methodology to evaluate any new protocols that would rehabilitate the edentulous patient with a fixed prosthesis.A computer search was performed using the Google search engine to review the following databases provided by various organizations: EDB.ada.org from the American Dental Association, Journal of Evidence‑Based Dental Practice from Elsevier/Mosby, Medline from the US National Library of Medicine, and Cochrane Library from the Cochrane Collaboration. An independent research dentist performed the literature review using the terms immediate loading, immediate load, full arch immediate load, immediate implantation, immediate function, immediate provisionalization, full arch immediate loading, all-on-four, guided surgery, and computer aided surgery in the key word searches. The search years for these keywords were limited to 2010 and 2011 because the purpose of this article was limited to current thinking and evidence on this specific technique. In this article, the author elected to restrict the literature search to the journals that are commonly read and received in his clinical practice on a monthly basis. The specific journals searched were The Journal of Periodontology, The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry, The Journal of The American Dental Association, The International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants, International Journal of Periodontics and Restorative Dentistry, and Implant Dentistry.Because of the specific nature of this procedure, all historical references to the “all-on-4” procedure were also included in the database inquiries. Conclusion The purpose of describing the initial methodology for this particular evidence-based inquiry is to advise the reader on how to conduct a search that would be performed by a prudent clinician busy in the daily clinical practice of dentistry. Our intent was not to do an extensive search that would be exhaustive in nature, such as one done for a systematic review paper by multiple investigators during sponsored symposia on evidence-based care for immediate-loading protocols for implant patients. The approach used in this article was proposed by Abhijit Gune in a review of evidence based dentistry in the Journal of the American College of Dentists in 2010. Dr. Gune suggested a very focused electronic search for private practitioners of no more than 30 minutes when researching a specific topic in journals that most commonly are read in the investigators area of specialization.9 The total amount of time used to search the literature in this article was 120 minutes by the independent research assistant using the parameters assigned by the author to provide a historical backdrop and current literature review of the investigated procedure.StEp 3: ApprAiSE thE VAliDity AnD rEliAbility oF thE EViDEnCE The most significant article identified in the literature search was published by the clinician who is identified as the early reporter on the clinical success of the procedure. Malo et al 10 reported in The Journal of The American Dental Association in 2011. They reported on 245 patients receiving a total of 980 dental implants with patient-related success rates of 93.8% and implant-related success rates of 94.8% at 10 years. The survival rate of their prostheses in the mandible was 99.2% at 10 years of follow-up.These results are significant and highly comparable in its reported successes to the landmark paper of Branemark et al in 1977.5 The original Branemark patient population validated the reliability of osseointegration on 6 implants for the rehabilitation of the edentulous patient on a fixed prosthesis, thereby establishing the gold standard at that time. Dr Brane-mark also reported on the use of 4 fixtures for the prosthetic reconstruction of an edentulous patient.11 tables 1 and 2 report the findings of this our literature search broken down by success rate in the maxilla and mandible respectively. Additionally, 3 articles have been published on the bioengineering of the protocol using finite element modeling. These experimental computer model studies by Silva et al in 2010,22Fazi et al in 2011,23 and Kim et al 201124 demonstrated some theoretical concepts that may be important relative to the investigated protocol. The following principles and guidelines were suggested from these articles:1. Titling of the distal implants does reduce the anteroposterior spread and therefore minimizes the cantilever lengths in investigated protocol. 2. Reducing the cantilever length in the investigated protocol is biomechanically sound and should be considered as the goal for all fixed implant prosthodontic appliances that are cantilevered distally.3. Finite element modeling stress patterns were similar in all-on-4 and all-on-6 models.4. Appropriately designed rigid prosthetic structures are needed to reduce the load of force vectors on the bone, abutments, screws, and biomaterials used in the fixed dental prosthesis.Conclusion Based on volume of clinical data available on the investigated technique, it would appear that sufficient references by multiple authors were found in the search engines by the independent investigator. Most of the articles reporting on the clinical outcomes were published as case series retrospective cohort studies. Parel and Phillips 29 reported in a preliminary study in 2010 a large number of implants, 2132, placed in the maxilla and mandible in an “all-on-four” configurations. They cumulative success rate was 96.53% in the maxilla and 99.30% in the mandible for the all-on-four approach from 2008 to 2010. The nature of this investigation on the effect of a specific therapeutic modality on real patients constitutes a large volume of the evidence-based literature. In this specific article, the use of the 4 implants in the maxilla and mandible to support an immediately loaded fixed full-arch all-acrylic prosthesis is being considered to determine if successful outcomes of this procedure measure favorably with long-established treatment protocols using time-tested 2-stage healing protocols and delayed loading of the definitive prosthesis.In addition to the clinical studies, research elicited several recent articles using the finite element method of computer modeling to perform structural mathematical analysis of a bar supported by 4 structures simulating dental implants. Within the acknowledged limitations of these finite element methods in human living structures, it appears that several biomechanical principles of a curve beam under various loading parameters can be established and possibly transferred to the clinical environment StEp 4. uSing EViDEnCE in trEAtMEnt plAnning For thErApEutiC rECoMMEnDAtionS to pAtiEntS.Since 2005, this author has used the technique of a computer-aided surgical approach using a stereolithographic guide or a malleable surgical device placed during a flap procedure in the maxilla and/or mandible. The clinician conducting this study also used additional methodologies to treat edentulous patients based on the objective and subjective clinical analysis of the patient. table 3 documents our clinical experiences since 2005 in treating edentulous patients. Conclusion Treatment planning for the edentulous patient should be a systematic analysis of the availability of bone, force factors present within the patient’s envelope of function, radiographic analyses, mandibular and maxillary bone physiology and anatomy, biomaterials, facial esthetics, treatment economics, and, most importantly, the patient’s needs and desires. Recommended treatment alternatives presented to our patients are based on these evaluations, informed consents, and based on the ethical principle of self-determination. In our clinical practice, it appears the investigated technique, as well other protocols, for totally edentulous patients can provided successful outcomes that match Malo’s 10 year with a prosthesis on 4 implants and Branemark gold standards for cumulative implant survival on 5 implants. However, the ultimate clinical outcome for the patient is the continuous lifetime survivability of the prosthesis regardless of the number of implants under the fixed prosthesis. Branemark et al11in 1985 also reported these data on the placement of 4 fixtures in the maxilla and mandible when local anatomy did not allow for placement of 6 fixtures. The 4 fixtures were restored with a fixed prosthesis following confirmation of osseointegration using a 2-stage healing protocol. Branemark et al10 went on to state that the results were almost identical to 6-fixture prosthesis results with regard to continuous bridge stability when observed over 5 to 12 years. table 4 reviews the continuous bridge stability from the 2 aforementioned studies identified in the literature review as well as the author’s own clinical data.From these data, it would appear that placing a fixed dental prosthesis with a substructure of titanium veneered in acrylic with bilaterally cantilevered distal extensions on 4 dental implants can provide the patient with predictable function and acceptable esthetics for long periods of time. The success of the prosthetic outcome can be achieved using a traditional 2-stage protocol for osseointegration or a single-stage immediate-loading protocol in the mandible and/or maxilla. StEp 5. ASSESSing trEAtMEnt outCoME AS ExpEriEnCE by thE pAtiEnt The final step of this article explores the most commonly overlooked arena of evidence-based medicine and dentistry: how did the clinical encounter lead to improve health and quality of life for the patient? This is a question that truly can be answered only by the patient who experiences the recommended treatment protocol. Unfortunately, the meaning of the concept of “quality of life” is constantly debated by biopsychological, epidemiological, and behavioral scientists with little or no consensus agreement on its applicability to the individual patient. Studies of the impact of dental implants on quality of life in a strict science sense can be weak but at the same time anyone who has treated this subset of dental patients for a long time knows the clinical outcome of thousands of patients worldwide expose the benefits of osseointegration and a fixed dental prosthesis are life-changing events for patients.MacEntee stated in 200625 that “when the subjects finally treated with fixed prosthesis ad modum Branemark novum, they felt that they at last became the person they once were.” They felt social security in interactions with others and also regained attraction as a result of their fixed prosthesis. For many years the informants described how they experienced good dental status, which did not cause them either pain or embarrassment. Patients also had feelings of gratitude for the technique that made it possible for them to go through with treatment for fixed prosthesis.Since 1986, this author has personally experienced these clinical commentaries and feelings exposed by many outpatients receiving fixed implant prosthesis. We did not document them in any formal tool used to subjectively record or objectively measure the quality-of-life change in the patient relative to the clinical encounter. In an attempt to document the patient experience with all protocols for totally edentulous patients without financial inducements, without violation of a code of ethics, and in respect for individual privacy, this author has videotaped documentation of the subjective experience of multiple patients receiving care for total edentulism. Most patients were asked a series of 5 questions by their encounters in our office that led to the successful placement of a fixed prosthesis:1. What challenges has this treatment overcome for you?2. How was your experience?3. What do you not have to put up with anymore?4. What surprised you about this experience?5. What would you tell others about your experience?These posttreatment interviews that document long- and short-term patients are posted on www.youtube/george-duello/.com. These interviews of patients who are suffering and have successfully been treated for total edentulism are dramatic and traumatic.Conclusion From the patient’s perspective, the quicker a disability can be resolved and health can be restored with reasonable predictability, the better the likelihood the patient will consent to the recommended procedure. Based on multiple successful patient treatments using various modalities of treatment and numerous patient exit interviews, it has been the author’s experience that when patients are faced with the option of 1 surgery and a prosthetic procedure in 1 setting for immediate loading versus multiple procedures over a prolonged time frame for resolution of the disability of total edentulism, the patient will select the least invasive and most expedient protocol that meets their needs and eliminates the challenges that total edentulism can present to patients. The greatest deterrent to resolving the disability of edentulism in an expeditious manner is not convincing the patient of the likelihood of a successful outcome. It is educating and convincing the dental profession at large that total edentulism is a serious health disability that can be mitigated without the use of removable complete dentures using multiple treatment algorithms that prolong the disability to the patient. Critics sometimes lament that they cannot understand why patients and dentists would be in a hurry to treat the patient in an expedited manner when older slower protocols work and have been tested over time. Those who have these traditionalist opinions, which this author also had for some time, need to “walk a mile” in the patient’s shoes before they rush to judgment on the need to reduce the sequence of treatments for edentulism. DiSCuSSion The scientific and biological foundation for this protocol is osseointegration, not the geometry of the fixture placement. Titanium fixtures can be placed vertically, tilted to various angles for dental prostheses, inserted horizontally in maxillofacial reconstructions to retain facial prosthesis fabricated by anaplastologists, or surgically implanted at multiple angles in linear incisions for bone-anchored hearing aids. It is the functionality and benefit to the patient who receives these devices that is the most important leg of evidence-based dentistry, not the axial placement and final orientation of the osseointegrated fixture . For more than 50 years, the den-tal literature has listed multiple protocols for the successful dental rehabilitation of the edentulous patient using various configurations for implant placement and prosthetic design.The technique proposed by Malo et al in 20032 and followed with the article by Malo et al in 2011,10 meets gold standards set by Professor Branemark based on the use of a 5-step evidence-based analysis demonstrated in the article. The protocol investigated in this article defines the lower limits of the number of implant fixtures required to successfully support a fixed implant prosthesis in the mandible or maxilla.Eldredge and Gould in 198526 stated that biological evolution is not a steady and gradual process. These authors pointed out that there are years of stability that are then interrupted by episodes of rapid innovation. Dentistry and dental procedures may follow the same stable practice patterns with practitioners making no or minor changes to procedures over prolonged periods. Then a so-called “tipping point” in research or clinical innovations exerts forces on the entire practice, which then forces the clinician to evaluate whether it is worthwhile to change habits based on new information. David Chambers in 2010 stated in a review of evidence-based dentistry that “only the integration in a unique practice setting of the relevant clinical epidemiology literature, professional judgment from patients’ circumstances and value counts as evidence-based dentistry.”27 The protocol investigated in this article defines the lower limits of the number of implant fixtures required to successfully support a fixed implant prosthesis in the mandible or maxilla.In his remarks for the First P-I Branemark Scientific Symposium in Gothenburg in 2009, Dr Branemark discussed the limits of what one can do with very sophisticated methods.28 Branemark closed with a statement suggesting simplified approaches to patient treatment by stating, “I hope you try to simplify procedures and make them more reliable.” Dr Branemark has always advocated the notion that less is more. He has stated that this was his ambition when it comes to dimensions and numbers of anchoring elements. But those precepts accepts the notion that the functional loads on the prosthesis do not allow undue stresses and strains to damage and destroy the bone tissue that is vital in providing function to the patient. The biologic healing phenomena of osseointegration is not determined by whether or not the implant fixture is vertical, horizontal, or tilted but rather by the human body’s ability to develop a functional stable interface between the biomaterial of the implant and the patient’s bone. Once osseointegration is achieved, then appropriate biomechanical factors need to be considered for the recommended prosthesis to replace teeth and orofacial structures to maintain osseointegration. From the observations of the scientific literature, clinical practice of the investigated protocol by multiple dentists throughout the world, and this clinician’s individual patients over many procedures, it can be concluded that 4 osseointegrated implants configured in the mandibular or maxillary arches are capable of supporting a fixed prosthesis to allow for an improved quality of life for an edentulous patient.",-,"American Dental Association.

Creating a virtual patient for completely edentulous computer-aided implant surgery: A dental technique,"Junying Li, DDS, MS, PhD, Celia Sommer, DMD, MPH, Hom-Lay Wang, DDS, MSC, PhD, Luca Lepidi, DDS, MDSc, Tim Joda, DMD, MSc, PhD, and Gustavo Mendonca, DDS, MS, PhD","A fully digital workflow for generating a virtual patient for completely edentulous computer-aided implant surgery is described. Existing dentures are temporarily relined with a radiopaque dental silicone material, and a cone beam computed tomography scan is made with the relineddenture inserted. Then, scans of the relined denture are made with an intraoral scanner. The Radiopaque silicone material increases the stability of the dentures and allows the a cone beam computed tomography images and the scans of the dentures to be superimposed to create a virtual patient. This technique may reduce laboratory work steps, clinical chairside time, and treatment costs.","The static computer-aided implant surgery technique has been widely accepted in dental implant treatment to ensure prosthetically driven surgery, control the 3D implant position accurately, and enable flapless surgery.1-4 The workflow of guided implant surgery for a completely edentulous patient typically includes fabrication of a stable denture and converting the denture into a radiographic template.5 This radiographic template is typically used for a dual-scan technique that comprises 2 cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans: a scan with the radiographic template in the mouth and a scan of the template.6a Virtual patient is created by merging the data from these 2 scene.6-10 With the advent of intraoral scanners (IOSs), new data acquisition workflows for completely edentulous patients have been developed.11Oh et al 12 and An et al 13 described combining the placement of flowable composite resin on the soft tissues and an IOS to eliminate the need for a specific radiographic template. The technique reduced the clinical steps by avoiding the fabrication of a specific radiographic template. However, intraoral scanning of a completely edentulous arch is problematic,14 and the flowable resin can be difficult to manipulate on soft tissue.Therefore, this technical report describes a more straightforward workflow to create a virtual patient for completely edentulous computer-aided surgery by using optical scans of relined dentures and CBCT imaging.TECHNIQUE This step-by-step technique is reported with an 81-year-old man. He had been wearing removable complete dentures for over 15 years, and they were now ill fitting.The patient approved a treatment plan for an implant-supported prosthesis. To create a virtual patient for static computer-aided implant surgery planning, workflow was developed.1. Spread a radiopaque polyvinyl siloxane occlusal registration material (Blu-Bite Fast Set Complete Package; Henry Schein, Inc) over the intaglio surface of the denture and insert it. Guide the patient to occlude in centric relation (CR) and ask the patient to change jaw positions between occluding in CR and licking the upper lip until the material polymerizes.152. Remove the denture and check that the material is evenly spread over the denture base in a thin layer(Fig. 1). If this is not achieved, remove the material and repeat step 1. The maxillary and mandibular denture should be relined in separate steps. If an implant-supported prosthesis is planned for only 1 arch, reline only the denture that will be used.3. With dentures placed in the patient's mouth,apply the occlusal registration material on the occlusal surface of the denture and guide the patient to occlude in CR. Wait until the material polymerizes.4. Make a CBCT scan of the patient wearing the dentures with relining materials. Export the images into Digital Imaging and Communications inMedicinefiles. The occlusal registration material becomes the radiographic marker in the images.5. Remove the dentures from the patient’s mouth and make optical scans of them by using an IOS (TRIOSColor Pod; 3Shape A/S) (Fig. 2). Export the scans as standard tessellation language (STL)files.6. Open the CBCT images and optical scans in an implant planning software program (Blue Sky Plan;Blue Sky Bio). Adjust the 3D reconstruction surface definition threshold to show the CBCT radiopaque marker clearly. Click the“Create model”button on the“Surface”panel to create a surface model of the CBCT (Fig. 3A).7. Select the denture scans and use the“Align to model”function in the“Model Manipulation”panelto align them to the surface model of the CBCT(Fig. 3B,3C). Check the accuracy of the registration.If necessary, further adjust the scan position manually (Supplementary Video 1, available online).8. To obtain soft tissue scan of the ridges, exportthe aligned denture scans from the implant planning software program and open them in a free CAD software program (Meshmixer; Autodesk). Crop the scans so that only the denture base surface remains. Invert the mesh by using the“Flip Normals”tool. The inverted mesh represent the soft tissue surface (Fig. 4)(Supplementary Video 2, available online).Export this surface as STL files.9. Import the soft tissue scans into the implant planning software program. A virtual patient with bone volume data from CBCT, soft tissue, and denturescans is created for implant planning (Fig. 5).DISCUSSION Creating a virtual patient with the correct 3D bone and denture reconstructions is a prerequisite of completely edentulous digital implant planning. The present technical report reported a simplified workflow for such aprocedure.In the conventional dual-scan approach,5-7 radiographic template duplicated from the denture must be used to align the CBCT images with the denture surfaces. In the present technique, polyvinyl siloxane material was used as the radiographic marker. Compared with previously described techniques,12,13this method not only provides markers for image registration but also improves the fit between the denture/surgical-template and the edentulous ridge (Supplementary Video 3, available online), thereby eliminating the need to fabricate a denture. Moreover, the polyvinyl siloxane impression material defines the soft tissue shape for the virtual patient. Compared with scanning the mucosa intraorally,12 scanning a denture is more straightforward, and chairside and laboratory work-time can be reduced. In addition, this workflow also uses a CBCT scan with the patient’smandibleinCR.If the scan contains the infraorbital point and external acoustic meatus, the transverse horizontal axis can be located with the method previously published,8 allowing the virtual patient to be mounted on a virtual articulator.

Rehabilitation of a maxillary partial edentulous patient using an implant-supported overdenture retained with two bilateral milled bars,"Atif Mohammed Almadani ,Fabian Huettig","The use of implants has enabled more treatment options for prosthetic rehabilitation of partially and completely edentulous patients. This clinical report describes a treatment approach for an 80-year-old patient taking advantage of the remaining natural teeth for prosthetic rehabilitation. The final treatment plan included natural tooth-supported and implant-supported crowns combined with a milled bar partial overdenture retained by tilted dental implants. The overdentures supported by the milled bar implants provide the advantages of both fixed and removable restorations. In addition to patient satisfaction, the overdentures also minimise alveolar bone resorption, increase longevity and stability and improve masticatory efficiency.","BACKGROUND Rehabilitation of the atrophic edentulous maxilla represents a prosthetic challenge to the clinicians. The design of conventional removable prostheses depends on the amount of remaining alveolar bone and properties, such as retention, stability and support.1 However, the traditional removable dentures prepared according to specified procedures may not provide adequate comfort and safety to all patients at all times.1 The anatomical problems also limit the retention of the prostheses especially in cases when only fewer teeth (≤4 teeth) are present. In such cases, implants might be a possibility.The predictable success of dental implants has made it possible to be used in patients with severe maxillary resorption who frequently face problems retaining the removable partial denture (RPD). Thus they allow them to have an additional treatment option.2 Implant treatment in the context of atrophy may call for sinus elevation and bone grafting.3 4 These measures increase the chance that patients rejecting such a treatment because of increased cost, invasive procedure and post surgical distress. Any pros-thesis fabricated to be used in those arches should be aesthetically acceptable, rigid, cost-effective, provide lip support and allow a simple daily oral hygiene maintenance.3–5An implant-supported overdenture is a removable denture combined with implants devised to enhance retention and stability for the stomatognathic function, such as smiling, chewing or even clenching. The support of RPDs by implants is an efficient solution for patients with atrophied jaws and prosthetic stability problems.1 2 Specifically, such an implant-supported RPD can be an alternative to an ‘unsuccessful’ fixed dental prosthesis. Commonly, removable prostheses have the advantage to facilitate easy oral hygiene procedures, providing better aesthetics and phonetics.6 Among the implant-supported overdentures, milled bar type is considered a reliable treatment option for atrophic ridges.1 7 8 They have the advantages to gain superior stability, retention, support which allow masticatory ability and patient satisfaction comparable to fixed dental prostheses.1 The clinician must inform the patients about all available treatment options based on anatomical conditions, prosthesis type, later oral hygiene maintenance, lip support, smile line, costs and duration of treatment.The clinical report presented here describes a treatment approach for the prosthetic rehabilitation in a patient with an atrophic upper jaw and two remaining second molars and a tilted occlusal plane. Thus, the strategy for an overdenture should reduce the surgical efforts and encompass the remaining teeth combined with two-implant-supported milled bars in hand with an occlusal adaptation of the lower removable prostheses.CASE PRESENTATION An 80-year-old Caucasian male patient presented in the Department of Prosthodontics at the University Hospital of Tuebingen, Germany, with the chief problem of discomfort and dissatisfaction concerning his existing maxillary denture. A comprehensive medical and dental history along with panoramic radiograph (orthopantomogram (OPG)) were obtained, and they did not present with any pathological findings. Intraoral examination revealed poorly adapted, and an aesthetically compromised maxillary denture supported by two posterior teeth with telescopic crowns (figure 1A,B). The lower jaw was provided with a telescopic removable denture on five anterior abutment teeth. The occlusal plane was rotated cranially and therefore not parallel to the Camper plane.The treatment plan based on patient’s complaints, clinical and radiographical examinations included implant-supported bar-retained maxillary overdenture with two telescopic hybrid double crowns as posterior abutments in hand with a technical adaptation of the existing telescopic denture in the lower jaw.Surgical intervention The diameter and length of the implant were determined by OPG obtained using the metal ball references (diameter=5mm) integrated into a vacuum moulded foil at the regions of teeth (FDI-scheme) 14, 12, 22, 24.The patient received prophylaxis antibiotic 1 day before the surgery (clindamycin, 300mg) to reduce the risk of postoperative infection. Surgery was carried out under local anaesthesia using 2% Ultracain D-S forte 1.8mL with epinephrine (1:100 000). A full-thickness flap was prepared to exhibit the topography of the remaining bone. Four dental implants (BEGO Semados SCX 58260, BEGO Implant Systems GmbH, Germany) with a diameter of 3.75 and 10mm in length were placed according to the bone situation at the region of 14, 24, 12 and 22. The posterior implants were placed with an angulation in accordance with the anterior wall of the sinus, and bone substitutes (Bio-Oss Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) were placed at the buccal site of left first premolar region. All implants had a final torque of 45 Ncm with good implant stability (see figure 2a). The healing caps were placed, and the flap repositioned and the suture was placed using Vicryl TM 3.0 (Ethicon R, Johnson & Johnson Medical NV, Belgium). An OPG was taken to cross-check the position of the implants (see figure2b).The patient was instructed not to wear his denture and to presume the antibiotic medication (clindamycin 300mg) for a further 5 days. Ibuprofen 400mg was recommended to reduce postoperative pain two times per day for 3 days. The sutures were removed 8 days after the surgery. The denture was adapted and relined with soft silicon relining material (Mollosil Plus, DETAX GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) in order to be further worn during the period of implants osseointegration. This was determined to be 6 months due to the implementation of bone substitutes as well as the recommendations for the healing period in the upper jaw.Prosthetic intervention The second stage of minor surgery was performed after 6 months of osseointegration. The absence of pain, no clinical mobility, infection and gingival bleeding determined the degree of osseointegration. In a second surgical procedure, a semilunar incision over the palatal half of the estimated implant head was performed under local anaesthesia. A tissue biopsy punch was used to differentiate the shape of the incision with the application of light pressure over the tissue.The implant was exposed by removing the cover and the healing abutments (3.5–5.0mm in diameter) were then placed over the implants. There was no need for sutures at this stage.10The old prosthesis was relined with tissue conditioner and the patient was recalled after 3 weeks.After 3 weeks, the old posterior metal crowns were removed, the preparation of the teeth were refined to allow the marginal fit of hybrid double crowns. Four impression copings were placed on the implants after removing the gingival formers. A customised acrylic resin tray (Zeta Tray LC, Zhermack GmbH, Germany) was fabricated on the gypsum cast delivered by the alginate impression. A pick-up coping impression was made with polyether impression materials (Impregum Penta, and Permadyne light-bodied, 3M Deutschland GmbH, Germany) in a double mixing technique. The provisional bite registration was recorded with putty silicon material (Silaplast, DETAX GmbH).Specifically, the horizontal and vertical maxillomandibular records were obtained with the old relined dentures initially and found suitable with regard to the thirds of the face. The soft-pogonion and subnasale were marked with a dot and the distance measured. This situation of vertical dimension was recorded with a putty polyvinyl siloxane elastomer (Silaplast) covering both dental arches while controlling the distance between the skin markers. Based on this jaw relation, a custom maxillary registration tray with wax bite blocks made from light curing resin (Zeta Tray LC, Zhermack GmbH), was ordered from the dental lab.In the next visit, the two primary copings of the molars were tried on and checked for marginal fit. The implant abutments were delivered in separated sets of two. These were connected intraorally with a resin (Pattern Resin, GC America, Illinois, USA). Again, a customised tray with perforations was applied (pick-up technique) in double mixing technique with polyether material (Impregum Penta/Permadyne light-bodied, 3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) to fabricate a cast. The casts were mounted on the articulator using a provisional jaw relationship. A bar retainer was divided into two portions due to the angulation of the posterior implants.The fit of the crowns # 17 # 27 was evaluated, and following removal of gingival formers from the top of the implant, the original abutments were screwed in with 20 Ncm torque. Each block of segments was screwed on top of the implant abutments. The abutments and the individual segments were affixed with pattern resin in the patient’s mouth. Definitive pick-up impression with second customised special impression tray over the splinted implants was made using a polyether impression material. After the setting of impression material, all the screws were loosened, and the impression was carefully removed from the mouth to avoid damage.The final maxilla–mandibular relation in vertical and horizontal dimension was recorded with the telescopic denture in the lower and the wax blocks of the custom tray in the upper. A facebow transfer to a semi adjustable articulator (Artex System, Amann-Girrbach, Pforzheim, Germany) allowed the positioning of the casts with the help of the registration tray (figure3).Once the jaw relation had been recorded, the bite index was created on the preliminary cast. Primary crowns were placed, and the bite block held in place by screws secured into two-implant, and the adjustment was achieved according to the lip support. Here it was noticed that the occlusal plane was not parallel to the Camper’s line in the sagittal axis. The occlusal plane was corrected in wax-up try-in, and the shade of the tooth was selected.In the next step, the wax-up try-in was done in the patient mouth in order to check for the function and aesthetics, and for the proper alignment of the anterior teeth before the milled bar retainer was designed. Bilateral balanced occlusion scheme was followed for teeth arrangement.The prosthesis framework try-in with two swivel ledges, two separated milled bar retainers and crowns with friction pins were fabricated (figure4). The occlusal plane was slightly elevated as instructed by the clinician. The bilateral bars were screwed over the implant abutments. Sheffield test was performed on the milled bar, and the fitting was optimum. In this test, the framework is seated onto the implants and one screw is tightened slightly and discrepancies are observed at the other terminal screw. The screw should not resist the tightening process.11The fitting of the framework try-in prosthesis was evaluated in the patient mouth. The upper occlusal plane was checked on both sides and parallel to the Camper plane. The upper anterior teeth were marked for needed modification according to the smile line. The posteriors were in 3mm distance to the lower as the situation was in the articulator to overcome the tilt of the occlusal plane.Delivery appointment Figure 5 presents the final intraoral situation of the patient with implant and attachments in situ and the internal fitting surface of the overdenture. Upper original abutments were screwed on the implants with a torque (30 Ncm) applying 1% chlorhexidine gel into the screw channel, and two separated milled bars were screwed on implant abutments. The hybrid double crowns were cemented using zinc phosphate cement (Harvard Cement, Harvard Dental International GmbH, Germany). The occlusion was recorded with a beautiful pink wax plate bite registration in order to mount a gypsum cast of the ‘new’ upper overdenture to the existing telescopic denture in the lower within a semi adjustable articulator. The posteriors of the lower denture were modified with a light-curing resin (Sinfony, 3M Deutschland GmbH) to ensure static and dynamic occlusion. Figure 6 presents the pretreatment and post-treatment photographs of the patient and the appliance.OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP►At the recall visit at 6 months, sound situations of the soft tissues were observed and there was no signs of bleeding.►Oral/prosthesis hygiene was maintained well.►The patient was delighted and satisfied with the implant-retained maxillary overdentures compared with his old conventional telescopic maxillary overdenture.A standard OPG with the implants bars was obtained for forensic reasons as stipulated by German law (figure 7). Postcode-livery instruction was given to the patient regarding prosthesis placement, removal and cleaning. Specifically, the cleaning of the milled bars with superfloss and the intaglio surfaces of the overdenture with a toothbrush. At the 1 week check-up visit, the prosthesis was evaluated, and the patient had no complaint. No plaque was detected on the bar or prosthesis. The patient was informed to maintain the hygiene measures and to show up for a recall visit after 6 months.DISCUSSION In the current case, considering the remaining natural teeth and the condition of maxillary bone it was planned to treat the case with tooth and implant-supported hybrid double crown combined with a milled bar partial overdenture.One treatment option would be a remake of the prosthesis with regard to the occlusal set-up of artificial teeth. This would have not allowed an improvement of retention and it would have necessitated the coverage of the palate by the basis of the overdenture denture. In palatal coverage by a complete denture, the oral environment is altered because of the less space available for the tongue which could affect the masticatory function, speech and disturb sensorimotor function.12 The removable overdenture is much similar to the form of the complete dentures, whereas the bases of the fixed prosthesis are usually narrower, which could overcome some of the problems of speech adaptation observed with fixed prosthesis.13The other treatment option would have been fixed implant-retained prosthesis. This would have been only possible by the insertion of at least eight implants and an intensive surgical approach, including a sinus lift at a region of the first upper molars (see OPG). Furthermore, a fixed restoration would not allow sufficient support of the upper lip and sophisticate the hygiene measures. This is important to mention since the patient is 80 years and manual as well as visual competence is reduced and is expected to be compromised within the next decade.The implant-retained milled bar overdenture presents with conically aligned one or two milled bars. The alignment ranges from 2 to 10 grades. The removable overdenture is then accurately and rigidly adapted to the bar, thereby limiting rotational and lateral movements. The rigid anchorage system evenly distributes the stresses due to different forces along with the implant-overdenture complex. Additionally, the overdenture contains fastenings that minimise the movement along its path of insertion. The retention is achieved by friction between the bar and counter bar in the overdenture and the fastenings.6 13–17 The prosthesis was incorporated with two swivel latch, a passive action element used to lock the denture. This gives the patient the feeling that the prosthesis is fixed and it will not come out.18 This attachment can be removed in the long run when manual dexterity is reduced. Even then enough retention could be obtained by friction pins within the superstructure.The implant-supported milled bar overdenture compared with the implant mucous supported overdenture, presents several advantages including limiting bone resorption, extending the life of the attachments, less prosthetic complications and maintenance needs.6 16 17In the current case, the spark erosion technique was used for refining the implant-supported superstructure. Spark erosion provides an excellent fit that ensured retention, stability and support similar to that of a fixed prosthesis.19 However, misfits between the bar and the implants might introduce constant stress to the implants after screw tightening. This strains on the implant-bone connection will consequence in a bone loss at the implant site. Thus, the Sheffield test evaluates the ‘passivity’ of the bar screwed on two or more implants. The non-passivity of the implants and/or the prosthesis may cause mechanical failures thereby adversely affecting the surrounding gingiva.20 In the present case, the Sheffield test showed that the fit was optimum. The telescopic hybrid double crown with a friction pin used as in this case presents advantages, including the reduction of the luted primary crown to provide more space for the secondary crown for aesthetic and hygienic purpose. Furthermore, the pin allows a later adjustment of retention and even a repair if broken.21 22 The limitations of these type of treatment and prosthesis includes critical treatment planning for positioning and placement of implants, and technique sensitive fabrication techniques. The patient was informed to maintain good oral hygiene and to have a regular follow-up.Contributor sAMA substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis or interpretation of data for the work; AMA and FH contributes in drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AMA and FH involved in final approval of the version to be published; AMA agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.Funding The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.Competing interests None declared.Patient consent for publication Obtained.Provenance and peer review Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.ORCID iDAtif Mohammed Almadani http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4259-5295.",-,"1Straioto FG, de Azevedo AM, do Prado CJ, et al.

Treatment of an Edentulous Patient With CAD/CAM Technology: A Clinical Report,"Carl J. Drago, DDS, MS; Thomas Peterson, MDT, CDT","CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing) technology with large-scale industrial applications has been developed and used over the last 3 decades. Implant Innovations, Inc.(Palm Beach Gardens, FL), has recently introduced a version of this technology for use in implant restorative dentistry. Different software programs were written to design and machine individual implant abutments and bar-type frameworks. This report provides a literature review of CAD/CAM technology in dentistry and describes the treatment of one edentulous patient restored with individual implant abutments and conventional cemented fixed partial dentures in the edentulous maxilla and a fixed, screw-retained prosthesis that replaced the missing mandibular teeth. The abutments were made using The Unicode TM Restorative System; the mandibular framework was made with a CAM Struct SURETEMP precision Milled Bar. The benefits and limitations of this technology are also discussed. Additional clinical and laboratory studies are needed to further validate this technology. INDEX WORDS: edentulous, CAD/CAM technology, diagnosis, laboratory procedures, clinical procedures","IMPLANT RESTORATIVE DENTISTRY requires significant interaction, communication, and cooperation between restorative dentists and dental laboratory technicians. Advances in both technology and biology have brought dramatic changes to patient care.1-3 The long-term clinical success of crowns, fixed and removable partial dentures, and implant frameworks is dependent, to a large degree, on the accuracy of the metal substructures within the prostheses. In conventional and implant restorative dentistry, the fit between castings and preparations or castings and implants is dependent upon, among other things, the accuracy of definitive impressions, master casts, and expansion/contraction associated with casting procedures.4,5 Present-day casting machines use either air pressure or centrifugal force to fill empty molds after the wax patterns have been vaporized,techniques that are very similar to those first proposed in the early days of lost-wax castings.6 Wichmann et al reported that approximately one-third of the castings surveyed exhibited casting-related defects.7Full-arch restorations supported by osseointegrated dental implants present a formidable challenge for dental laboratory technicians and restorative dentistry. A universal objective in treating edentulous patients with implant-retained prosthesis is obtaining a passive fit between frameworks and implants to minimize or eliminate biological or biomechanical failure.8-10 Non-passively fitting frameworks may result in complications such as screw loosening or component fracture.11-13 To obtain a clinically passive fit,frameworks may need to be sectioned and soldered/welded if necessary, although this may result in new errors of misfit.14,15 Several authors consider one-piece casting technology to be the treatment of choice because it results in frameworks that are stable and potentially more homogeneous.16 According To Klineberg and Murray,17 frameworks with gap widths up to 30μm across 90% of the abutment cylinder area can be considered to have a satisfactory passive fit. Branemark et al suggested that a gap width between abutment and superstructure of<10μm be considered to be a passive fit.18 Eisenmann et al recently stated that as long as it remains unclear what bone biologic reaction to chronic loading will be and whether and how much bone resorption will occur, clinicians should strive to achieve a precise, passive fit of implant frameworks to minimize additional stress at the implant–bone interface.19The National Institute of Dental Research Called for the development of computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manufacturing(CAD/CAM) for dental restorations.20 Milled Restorations from blocks of homogeneous materials such as metal, resin, or porcelain should eliminate some of the problems inherent in dental castings.7 Computer software and hardware systems have been developed, modified, and occasionally abandoned.1,21,22 The CEREC System(Sirona, Patterson Dental Co., Milwaukee, WI) isa commercially available CAD/CAM system formilling single unit ceramic restorations in dental offices. It was designed for general dentiststo image intraoral preparations with an opticalscanner, design all-ceramic restorations, and millthe restorations in their offices. One of the majorlimitations with this system is that it requiresdentists, at considerable expense, to purchase thescanners, milling units, and computer softwareprograms.Ortorp et al11reported the results of a labora-tory study in which the accuracy of implant frame-worksfitting a laboratory master model were com-pared. Frameworks (20) were either fabricatedwith a computer numeric controlled (CNC) pro-cess, or the frameworks (5) were made using theconventional lost wax technique. The computer-designed and -milled frameworks demonstratedsignificantly betterfits between the frameworksand the implant analogs than the cast frameworks:13-15μm for the CNC frames and 43-180μm forthe cast frameworks.The purpose of this report is to illustratethe treatment of an edentulous patient withfixed implant-retained, full-arch prostheses thatwere constructed using CAD/CAM technology(ARCHITECH PSR, 3i Implant Innovations,Inc., Palm Beach Gardens, FL). The edentulousmandible was treated with seven implants and afixed hybrid prosthesis fabricated on a CAD/CADtitanium alloy framework (CAM StructSURETMPrecision Milled Bar, 3i Implant Innovations). Theedentulous maxillae were treated with eight im-plants: seven were restored with seven CAD/CAMabutments (The EncodeTMRestorative System, 3iImplant Innovations) and one, due to peri-implantsulcular depths of<1 mm, was restored with a cus-tom cast UCLA abutment. The maxillary implantswere splinted with threefixed partial dentures(FPDs).Clinical PresentationA 72-year-old partially edentulous male patientpresented to an oral surgeon with the chief com-plaint,“I want my remaining teeth out. I alsowant dental implants’’(Fig 1). This patient had lost the majority of his teeth in a haphazard fashion and was not wearing any type of removable prosthesis.The patient presented with a negative medi-cal history and no contraindications for implant surgery. Radiographs, a thorough clinical examination, diagnostic casts, and diagnostic articulator mounting were performed. Dentures were required to identify the vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO), centric jaw relationship, and the optimal location of the missing teeth. Impressions And record bases were fabricated to mount thecasts. Diagnostic wax dentures were fabricated atan optimal VDO with esthetics that were accepted by the patient. It was determined that the jaw relationships would permit fabrication of fixed,implant-retained prosthesis for both jaws.This patient was classified as a Class II edentulous patient (moderately compromised)per the American College of Prosthodontists Classification of Edentulous Patients. 23(The Classification System has recently been renamed the Prosthodontic Diagnostic Index (PDI), and allows the patient to be classified based on the severity of their pretreatment dental condition.) This Patient presented with satisfactory bone height in both jaws, a Class I jaw relationship, satisfactory maxillary and mandibular residual ridge morphology, and normal muscle attachments. A treatment plan was presented to the patient that included 6.8 maxillary and 6-8 mandibular implants to retain the prostheses. Benefits and limitations of this treatment were explained, and the patient agreed to proceed. It was decided to remove the remaining mandibular teeth and allow the sockets to heal prior to implant placement. This patient did not wish for any type of transitional removable prostheses to be constructed.Surgical Treatment The wax dentures were duplicated for use as surgical guides (Figs 2 and 3). Eight maxillary implantsand seven mandibular implants (OSSEOTITENT, 3i Implant Innovations, Inc.) were placedin two separate surgical appointments using one-stage surgical protocols. The maxillary implantsand healing abutments were placed at thefirstsurgical appointment (Fig 2). The mandibularimplants and healing abutments were placed ap-proximately 20 days later (Fig 3). Single-stagesurgical protocols have proven to be as efficacious as the traditional 2-stage surgical protocols.24-26Osseointegration occurred uneventfully, and theprosthetic phase of treatment began approxi-mately 4 months post-implant placement.Prosthetic TreatmentThe protocol for this CAD/CAM technology is sim-ilar to the original prosthetic protocol developedby Branemark, in that the locations of the teethneed to be determined prior to fabrication of theimplant frameworks, except that the frameworkwas going to be made directly on the implants in-stead of on transmucosal abutments.18This couldbe accomplished because the peri-implant sulcu-lar depths measured 2-3 mm in height. This alsoresulted in a significant cost savings, because theauthor did not have to buy abutments, cylinders,and retaining screws. Preliminary alginate impressions and diagnos-tic casts were made approximately 16 weeks afterimplant placement. Custom implant impressiontrays were fabricated for use with an open tray,pick-up impression protocol. All the maxillary andmandibular healing abutments were removed forimplant level impressions. Implant lab analogs ofthe appropriate sizes were attached to the impres-sion copings within the impressions and mastercasts (GC FujirockEP, GC Europe, Leuven,Belgium) were fabricated in conventional fashion.The peri-implant soft tissues were replicated witha vinyl polysiloxane impression material (AquasilUltra LV, Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE) prior topouring the casts. Maxillary and mandibular ver-ification indices were made in the laboratory withautopolymerizing acrylic resin (Relate, Parkell,Farmingdale, NY) and allowed to set for 24 hours.The indices were sectioned into individual seg-ments prior to the next clinical appointment(Fig 4).The indices were tried-in individually and lutedtogether with autopolymerizing acrylic resin. Anew impression was made with the verification in-dices in place, and new master casts were poured.27Record bases and a maxillary occlusion rim werefabricated on these master casts. A jaw relationrecord was made at an acceptable VDO, and themaster casts were mounted. The patient was re-appointed for a wax try-in. The patient approvedthe wax try-in.The abutments, framework, and prostheseswere designed on separate work orders and sentto a commercial dental laboratory (North ShoreDental Laboratory, Lynn, MA). The casts werethen shipped to the CAD/CAM work site for vir-tual design and milling (ARCHITECH PSR,3iImplant Innovations, Inc.).Mandibular FrameworkThe mandibular framework was designed per theoriginal Branemark protocol except the frame-work was to be attached directly to the implants.Transmucosal abutments were not used. The mas-ter cast and wax denture were scanned, and theinformation was digitized. The framework (CAMStructSURETMPrecision Milled Bars) was de-signed on a computer with a sophisticated com-puter software program and was e-mailed to thedental laboratory technician for editing, modi-fications as needed, andfinal approval (Fig 5).This protocol minimized the costs associated with full-arch frameworks in which abutments, cylin-ders, and retaining screws need not be purchased.Also, all the work was done on a computer. Waxing,casting,finishing, soldering procedures, etc. werenot required. This represented significant timesavings to the commercial dental laboratory.Maxillary AbutmentsThe maxillary abutments were to be fabri-cated using a different CAD/CAM technology(The EncodeTMRestorative System, 3i ImplantInnovations, Inc.). Special healing abutments(EncodeTMHealing Abutments) were placed ontothe implant lab analogs in the master cast. Clin-icians may also place these healing abutments clinically for intraoral impressions. It is the au-thors’opinion that it is more cost-effective to useEncodeTMHealing Abutments in the laboratory todevelop the master cast needed for scanning andmachining Final EncodeTMAbutments (Fig 6).EncodeTMHealing Abutments have codes em-bedded into their occlusal surfaces that indicateto the computer the type of implant/abutmentconnection, the size of the implant restorativeplatform, and the height/width of the healingabutments (Fig 7). An elastomeric impression wasmade after these healing abutments were placedon the implant lab analogs in thefirst master cast,and a new cast was poured in Type IV die stone(Golden Brown, GC Fuji RockEP, Alsip, IL).This maxillary master cast and wax denturewere scanned, and the information was digitized.The abutments were designed (margin design andlocation, interocclusal clearance, taper of the axialwalls) on a computer with a sophisticated com-puter software program. Abutment parallelismwas determined by the design of the proposedFPDs. These virtual abutments were e-mailed tothe dental laboratory technician for approval priorto milling (Fig 8). Once the designs were approved,the maxillary abutments and mandibular frame-work were milled from blanks of titanium alloy(Fig 9). The abutment blank interface connectionsfor the individual abutments had premachined im-plant/abutment restorative platforms for precisetolerances.The abutments and framework were shippedback to the commercial dental laboratory for con-struction of the maxillary FPD frameworks usingconventional casting technology. The mandibular titanium alloy framework was silicated. The abutments, FPDs, and mandibular framework were shipped to the first author for the clinical try-in appointment.At the clinical try-in appointment (Figs 10-13),the jaw relation record was verified, as well as the fit between abutments, implants, and frameworks.The abutments, FPD frameworks, and mandibular framework were returned to the laboratory for completion of the prostheses (Figs 14 and 15).Advantages of CAD/CAM Titanium Frameworks Waxing, casting, soldering, and/or laser weld-ing and the challenges associated with their technologies have been eliminated with the CAD/CAM technologies illustrated in this report.This mandibular framework was made from a homogenous titanium alloy blank (Fig 16); millinga framework from a solid blank of titanium alloy eliminated casting porosities and ensured a homogeneous metal framework. In the event of a miscast with conventional casting technology,the laboratory must purchase new implant components, at additional expense, because the original components were destroyed or damaged with the miscast. Another advantage with this CAD/CAM technology was that abutments were not used,because the framework was made to fit directly to the implant restorative platforms. This technology does not involve any manual labor for fabrication of wax or resin patterns prior to computer design/milling and results in significant time savings to commercial dental laboratories by eliminating this labor-intensive step. The Mandibular framework was actually less expensive to produce for the author than with a conventional casting of like design because the author did not have to buy abutments, cylinders, and retaining screws. The only implant components purchased were abutment screws and implant lab analogs.Advantages of CAD/CAM Titanium Abutments With the CAD/CAM technology illustrated in this report for the maxillary abutments, clinicians and commercial dental laboratories will not need to inventory or order multiple abutments, since all but one of the abutments were computer designed and custom milled from titanium alloy blanks.However, there are limitations with this technology in terms of parallelism (implants have to be within 30◦of one another) and there must be at least 1 mm of peri-implant soft tissue to allow machining of CAD/CAM abutments. In this case,due to lack of peri-implant soft tissue depth on the facial aspect of the maxillary left second premolar,a custom abutment had to be waxed and cast from a machined UCLA abutment. Both CAD/CAM and UCLA abutments can be custom milled to replicate the emergence profiles of missing teeth and follow the peri-implant soft tissue contours around implants; however, the labor and material costs associated with custom cast abutments is significantly greater than that of the corresponding costs associated with CAD/CAM abutments. This CAD/CAM technology can also be used in more straightforward cases (i.e., 1-3 missing teeth) than that of the treatments illustrated in this report.Summary During the last three decades, implant dentistry has enabled clinicians to treat edentulous and partially edentulous patients predictably with fixed restorations. The abutment selection process for clinicians and dental laboratory technicians has been somewhat problematic due to the multiple implant systems, connections, and abutment choices available commercially. The CAD/CAM technologies illustrated in this article have improved the restorative process associated with implant treatment by decreasing costs and improving efficiencies with increased accuracy. Further clinical and laboratory research is indicated to validate these processes on a long-term basis.Acknowledgments The author gratefully acknowledges the assistance of Lisa Adams, Hannah Johnson, and Katherine Galvin Of Palm Beach Gardens, FL in production of this manuscript and the attending oral surgeons: P.

Correction of microstomia in an edentulous patient,"Aditi Nanda, MDS, Sriram Krishnan, MDS, Harsimran Kaur, MDS, Dheeraj Koli, MDS, Karan Manak, MDS, Mahesh Verma, PhD, and Shubhra Gill, MDS","The problem of small oral aperture is big. Irrespective of the etiology, this problem may be overcome by adjunctive therapies in the form of prosthesis, surgery, or exercise. A patient is described with this problem, which was overcome by revisiting the 3 adjunctive therapies including acommissural stent designed with the patient’s edentulous state in mind.","Microstomia has been described as a diminished oral aperture.1 It may result from various causes that lead to cicatricial scar formation,2re-sulting in esthetic compromise,hypotonicity of the circumoral musculature, and decrease in vertical and horizontal opening of the mouth.3,4 The main problem that can arise due to microstomia can be functional (speech, nutrition,hygiene) or esthetic (due to asymmetric lip placement).4.6 There are many treatment options available: surgical,6-8 non surgical,1,9-13 and a combination.14,15In any of the treatment options, the aim is not just providing well-functioning lips with increased mouth opening and improved esthetics, but also providing a stable and long-lasting result.14Three adjunctive therapies (surgery,stent, and exercise) were planned for an edentulous patient with microstomia.CLINICAL REPORTA 55-year-old man reported with reduced mouth opening after surgical intervention (Figs. 1,2). His history revealed that surgical intervention had been undertaken to resect a growth (diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma) in the left lower vestibule and corner of mouth about 6 months before, which resulted in cicatricial scar formation and the current chief complaint of reduced mouth opening. The patient reported being a chronic chain smoker over the past 10 years. Examination Revealed asymmetry in the location of left and right lip commissures. The left commissure was closer to the facial midline (1.5 cm from the facial midline) compared to the right commissure (2.5 cm) at rest. Reduced mouth opening was also noted (approximately 3.5 cm when measuring between the upper and lower lip at the vermillion border of the lips in the region of the facial midline). Intraoral examination revealed that the patient was completely edentulous.Treatment goals were to improve the mouth opening(to improve function); to attain symmetrical positioning of commissure; and to perform long-term maintenance of the aforementioned goals.Combined nonsurgical and surgical intervention was planned to achieve the treatment goals. The surgical intervention was to perform commissuroplasty of the left commissure. The extent of commissuroplasty was planned to maintain a distance of the left commissure equivalent to distance of the right commissure from the facial midline. The nonsurgical intervention was to fabricate a passive commissural stent before surgery and put it to effective use immediately after surgery. The Same stent was to be continued in a dynamic manner after initial healing of the wound by a slight modification of the stent. Additionally, mouth stretching exercises were advised to augment the mouth opening.The pre surgically fabricated commissural stent was designed in 2 separate commissure conformers, made out of clear thermoplastic bioplast sheet (Bioplast sheets;Scheu Dental GmbH). The 2 conformers were connected to each other by removable means using a cervical headgear. Impression of both left and right cheeks was made with mouth maximally opened. Before making the impression, the extent of incision for commissuroplasty was marked (with indelible pencil) in relation to the left commissure, which was decided by equating it with the distance from the facial midline and the location of the right commissure at rest. The impression was made with polyvinyl siloxane (Aquasil Ultra, Putty; Dentsply Caulk)in putty consistency. The material was mixed and adapted over the outer and inner (mucosal) surfaces of the cheeks on both the left and right sides (Fig. 3). While Adapting the impression material intraorally, care was taken to extend the material to the full depth of the maxillary and mandibular buccal vestibule. The impression was extended extraorally, keeping in mind the area required to be covered by the stent for retention yet not interfering with function. Digital support was provided to the impression material throughout the setting of the impression material. Once the material had set, the impression was removed, and the cast was poured in Type III dental stone (Kaldent; Kalabhai).The cast of the left side was modified by trimming until the extent of the area that was planned to be surgically removed (as marked before making the impression). Separating material was applied (Bioplast insulator;Scheu Dental GmbH) on the casts, and 3.0 mm thick thermoplastic material (Bioplast sheets; Scheu Dental GmbH) was adapted using a Biostar V machine (Bioplast Scheu Dental GmbH) at 6 MPa pressure for 30 seconds to fabricate commissure conformers. The 2 conformers were attached through the cervical headgear to complete the commissural stent (Fig. 4). Double J-shaped hooks were fabricated using 19-gauge orthodontic stainless steel wire (K.C. Smith). One end of the hook is attached to the conformer through a pierced hole. The Free end of the J-shaped hook was attached to the cervical headgear (Leone Neck Pad for Safety Release;Libraltraders, Leone Safety Release modules; Libral-traders) on both the left and right sides to complete the commissural stent. The region of attachment to the cervical headgear determined the amount of tension created by the stent using a Dontrix gauge (Leone Dontrix Gauge; Libraltraders), and it was hence determine whether the stent was to be used in passive state(immediately after surgery) or in a dynamic state (after healing of surgical wound).The purpose of the surgical procedure was to remove the scar tissue, enhance primary healing, and minimize tissue contraction.16The contracture was released by a continuous incision through the skin (extraorally) n mucosa (intraorally), thereby creating a triangular defect.The extent of the incision was as previously decided.The patient was shown and instructed how to assemble the 2 separate stent components with the headgear (Fig. 5). The stent was maintained to be passive for the initial 14 days, with the main aim to prevent relapse in initial stages. The J-shaped hook was symmetrically inserted at the third hole of the cervical headgear. After 14 days, the position of the hook was moved more posteriorly (according to maximum patient tolerance) to make the stent more active and dynamic in order to consistently apply force and prevent recurrence due to scar formation (Fig. 6). The patient was instructed to wear the stent for duration of not fewer than 14 hours,including nighttime wearing.As suggested previously,11manual mouth-stretching and jaw-stretching exercises were advised to be repeated alternately 10 times per instance and twice a day. A substantial improvement in mouth opening (4.0cm measuring between upper and lower lip at the vermillion border of the lips in the region of the facial midline) was observed, and placement of the left commissure (Figs. 7,8) was attained at the end of 5weeks. After improvement of mouth opening, a conventional complete denture was fabricated. The patient reported with consistent findings in his 9-month recall.DISCUSSION surgical intervention was required because the scar contracture was already present and needed to be excised. Addition of exercise augmented the results by promoting stretch. A commissural stent was fabricated using complete extraoral anchorage with the cervical headgear. The design of the appliance was made keeping in mind the edentulous state of the patient. The commissural stent was prescribed in a passive state during the early healing phase to prevent any relapse and connective tissue growth. The same commissural stent was made dynamic to increase the amount of stretch, if any relapse should occur, and maintain the achieved opening. The other advantages of the commissural stent were as follows: it provided physical resistance to scar contracture, together with a horizontal and vertical lip stretch 3; it permitted movement and function of the surgical region with traction without applying a constant force that could cause pressure necrosis; it was easy to fabricate; and no general anesthesia was required for the procedure. The drawbacks included an esthetic compromise (while in use); mechanical interference during mastication; and dependence on patient compliance(removable appliance) for results.CONCLUSIONS Adjunct therapies can be implemented before the fabrication of complete dentures in patients with microstomia as an alternative to a conventional protocol of sectional complete dentures.",-,"1.Wust KJ.

Classification System for Complete Edentulism,"Thomas J. McGamy, DDS Arthur Nimmo, DDS: James F. Skiba, DDS Robert H. Ahlstrom, DDS, and Jack H. Koumjian, DDS, MSD","The American College of Prosthodontists has developed a classification system for complete edentulism based on diagnostic findings. These guidelines may help practitioners determine appropriate treatments for their patients. Four categories are defined, ranging from Class I to Class IV, with Class I representing an uncomplicated clinical situation and a Class IV patient representing the most complex and higher-risk situation. Each class is differentiated by specific diagnostic criteria. This system is designed for use by dental professionals who are involved in the diagnosis of patients requiring treatment for complete edentulism. Potential benefits of the system include: 1) better patient care, 2) improved professional communication, 3) more appropriate insurance reimbursement, 4) a better screening tool to assist dental school admission clinics, and 5) standardized criteria for outcomes assessment.

INDEX WORDS: complete dentures, diagnosis, treatment planning, prosthodontics, dental education, graduate dental education, outcomes assessment, quality assurance, treatment outcomes","COMPLETELY EDENTULOUS PATIENTS exhibit a broad range of physical variations and health concerns. Classifying all edentulous patients as a single diagnostic group is insensitive to the multiple levels of physical variation and the differing treatment procedures required to restore function and comfort. A graduated classification of complete edentulism has been developed that descri bPs varying levels of loss of denture-supporting structures. This article defines complete edentulism as follows: the physical state of the jaw(s) following removal of all erupted teeth and the condition of the supporting structures available for reconstructive or replacement therapies. The condition of edentulism, for the purpose of this article, is divided into four levels according to specific diagnostic criteria. The absence of organized diagnostic criteria for complete edentulism has been a long-standing impediment to effective care for patients. Recognition of the diverse nature, scope, and degree of complete edentulism, although thoroughly described in the dental literature, has not been organized to efficiently guide dental educators, general dentists, prosthodontists, and third-party payers in providing the appropriate treatment for each patient. A system for facilitating patient identification is needed to improve patient treatment outcomes. The American College of Prosthodontists (ACP) recognized its responsibility to the public and the profession to correct this dilemma. The Subcommittee on Prosthodontic Classification was formed in 1995 and charged with developing classification systems for prosthodontic patients. Timely implementation of this system will benefit patients, clinicians, and educators. The classification system for complete edentulism is presented in the following sections. Development of the Classification System A classification system has been successfully used to assess periodontal status for more than 20 years.' Recently, the American Association of Endodontists devised an evaluation system for determining endodontic risk factors.2 These factors serve as guidelines to determine when patients with advanced treatment needs should be referred for consultation with a specialist. The classification system for complete edentulism will establish separate diagnostic entities fur four levels of edentulism, ranked according to degree of difficulty of treatment. A review of the prosthodontic literature was used to identify the many variables associated with complete edentulism. A questionnaire was then constructed to categorize the 89 variables identified. The questionnaire that was circulated within the subcommittee asked for comments and literature citations to support inclusion of a variable into a diagnostic system. The data collected via this questionnaire were formatted into a new survey instrument that differentiated variables into four subclasses: I. Physical findings; 2. Prosthetic history; 3. Pharmaceutical history; 4. Systemic disease evaluation. The variables in these four subclasses of variables were further evaluated to determine their importance in relation to: Educational requirement: What additional clinical skill or knowledge is necessary to manage this variable? Clinical responsibility: Is the variable most significantly to the patient, practitioner, or the dental laboratory technician? Clinical technique modification: ?$'ill this variable require a change in conventional five-step technique, and could this variable have a significant effect on patient satisfaction? Clinical and laboratory time requirement: Will this variable require additional time by the practitioner, clinical staff, and/or the dental laboratory technician? Overall clinical significance: Will this variable require advanced education to manage? The subcommittee established a ranking of individual variables. Subsequently, a classification system was developed based on the most objective variables. The survey was sent to a cross-sectional sample of 10% of the ACP fellows and main bars and to representatives of prosthodontic organizations. A five-step scoring grid was included that asked if the classification would be one of the following: very helpful, helpful, not helpful and had minor flaws, or had major flaws. Of the 250 drafts sent out, 56 were returned. When the results were tallied, 73.4% of responses expressed the view that the classification would be very helpful or helpful. Nine percent said the system would not be helpful. Minor flaws were identified by 15.6% of the respondents, and 1.7% stated that the system had major flaws; however, no consistent flaws were identified in the comments. The additional information gained from this survey and initial draft comments was incorporated into a definitive document. System Applications This system, when combined with the appropriate Parameter of Care,3 will establish a basis for diagnosis and treatment procedures. In addition, patients will be provided with treatment justifications for third-part): payers to ensure that the patient is able to receive appropriate prosthodontic care, should referral to a specialist be necessary The classification system will be of value to dental faculty responsible for screening new edentulous patients. Dental educators will need to determine which classes of complete edentulism can be treated within their predoctoral clinical program."" Patients diagnosed at more advanced levels should be referred to graduate prosthodontics programs or to a practicing prosthodontist. Data gathered and organized using this system will enable the dental educator, general dentist, or prosthodontist to review clinical outcomes in evidence-based diagnostic criteria. By identifying thc advanced patient before treatment and making thc appropriate referral, when indicated, the incidence of retreatment should decrease. The classification system will be subject to monitoring and revision as new diagnostic and treatment information becomes available in the literature. The experiences gained in its application in practice will enable the provider to determine which treatment procedures would be most appropriate for a patient with a specific diagnosis. With the premise that complete edentulism has differing degrees of severity, the committee sought to identify and group the most significant diagnostic criteria. The following criteria should help in applying the guidelines in a consistent manner. A Systematic Review of Diagnostic Criteria for the Edentulous Patient The diagnostic criteria are organized by their objective nature and not in their rank of significance. Because of variations in adaptive responses, certain criteria are more significant than others However, objective criteria will allow for the most accurate application of the classification system and measurement of its efficacy. Objectivity also will provide reliable outcome data and mechanisms for review by third-party payers and peer-review panels. The diagnostic criteria used in the classification system are listed in the worksheet (Table 1). Bone Height: Mandible only The identification and measurement of residual bone height is the most easily quantified objective criterion for the mandibular edentulous ridge.6-g In addition, it represents a measurement of the chronic debilitation associated with complete edentulism in the mandible. Despite the lack of a known etiology, it has been established that the loss of denture- supporting structures does occur.6.8 Atwood's description in 1971 of alveolar bone loss is still applicable today: “Chronic progressive, irreversible and disabling process probably of multifactorial origin. At the present time, the importance of various cofactors is unknown.” The continued decrease in bone volume affects: 1) denture-bearing area; 2) tissues remaining for reconstruction; 3) facial muscle support/attachment; 4) total facial height; and 5) ridge morphology. The results of a radiographic survey of residual bone height measurement are affected by the variation in the radiographic techniques and magnification of panoramic machines of different manufacturers. To minimize variability in radiographic techniques, the measurement should be made on the radiograph at that portion of the mandible of the least vertical height. The values assigned to each of the four types listed below are averages that historically have been used in relation to preprosthetic surgical procedures. A measurement is made and the patient is classified as follows: Type I (most favorable): residual bone height of 21 mm or greater measured at the least vertical height of the mandible (Fig 1); Type II: residual bone height of 16 to 20 mm measured at the least vertical height of the mandible (Fig 2); Type III: residual alveolar bone height of 11 to 15 mm measured at the least vertical height of the mandible (Fig 3); Type N: residual vertical bone height of 10 mm or less measured at the least vertical height of the mandible (Fig 4). Residual Ridge Morphology: Maxilla Only Residual ridge morphology is the most objective criterion for the maxilla, because measurement of the maxillary residual bone height by radiography is not reliable."" The classification system continues on a logical progression, describing the effects of residual ridge morphology and the influence of musculature on a maxillary denture."" Type A (most favorable) (Fig 5) Anterior labial and posterior buccal vestibular depth that resists vertical and horizontal movement of the denture base. 0 Palatal morphology resists vertical and horizontal movement of the denture base. Sufficient tuberosity definition to resist vertical and horizontal movement of the denture base. 0 Hamular notch is well defined to establish the posterior extension of the denture base. Absence of tori or exostosis. Type B (Fig 6) Loss of posterior buccal vestibule. 0 Palatal vault morphology resists vertical and horizontal movement of the denture base. Tuberosity and hamular notch are poorly defined, compromising delineation of the posterior extension of the denture base. Maxillary palatal tori and/or lateral exostoses are rounded and do not affect the posterior extension of the denture base. Type C (Fig 7) 0 Loss of anterior labial vestibule. Palatal vault morphology~7 offers minimal rcsis- tance to vertical and horizontal movement of the denture base. 0 Maxillary palatal tori and/or lateral exostoses with bony undercuts that do not affect the posterior extension of the denture base.

Type D (Fig 8) 0 Loss of anterior labial and posterior buccal vestibules. 0 Palatal vault morphology does not resist vertical or horizontal movement of the denture base. Maxillary palatal tori and/or lateral exostoses"" (rounded or undercut) that intc ferc with the posterior border of the denture. Hyperplastic, redundant anterior ridge. Prominent anterior nasal spine. Muscle Attachments: Mandible only The effects of muscle attachment and location are most important to the function of a mandibular denture.~~'""'~ These characteristics are difficult to quantify. The classification system follows a logical progression to describe the effects of muscular influence on a mandibular denture. The clinician examines the patient and selects the category that is most descriptive of the mandibular muscle attachments. Type A (most favorable) (Fig 9) Attached mucosa base without undue muscular impingement during normal function in all regions. Type B (Fig 10) Attached mucosa base in all regions except labial Mentalis muscle attachment near crest of alveolar vestibule . ridgc. Type C (Fig 11) Attached mucosal base in all regions except antc- rior buccal and lingual vestibules-canine to canine. dentition. Examine the patient and assign a class as follows: 0 Class I (most favorable): Maxillomandibular relation allows tooth position that has normal articulation with the teeth supported by the residual ridge. Class II: Maxillomandibular relation requires tooth 0 position outside the normal ridge relation to attain esthetics, phonetics, and articulation (eg, anterior or posterior tooth position is not supported by the residual ridge; anterior vertical and/or horizontal overlap exceeds the principles of fully balanced articulation). Class III: Maxillomandibular relation requires tooth position outside the normal ridge relation to attain esthetics, phonetics, and articulation (ie crossbite-anterior or posterior tooth position is not supported by the residual ridge). Integration of Diagnostic Findings The previous four subclassifications are important determinants in the overall diagnostic classification of complete edentulism. In addition, variables that can be expected to contribute to increased treatment difficulty are distributed across all classifications according to their significance. Figure 13.

Type E (Fig 13) No attached mumsa in any region. Maxillomandibular Relationship The classification of the maxillomandibular relationship characterizes the position of the artificial teeth in relation to the residual ridge and/or to opposing Class I (Fig 14 A-H) This classification level characterizes the stage of edentulism that is most apt to be successfully treated with complete dentures using conventional prosthodontic techniques.6 All four of the diagnostic criteria are favorable. Residual bone height of 21 mm or greater measured at the least vertical height of the mandible on a panoramic radiograph. Residual ridge morphology resists horizontal and vertical movement of the denture base; Type A maxilla. Location of muscle attachments that are conducive to denture base stability and retention; Type A or B mandible. Class I maxillomandibular relationship. Class 11 (Fig 15 A-H) This classification level distinguishes itself by the continued physical degradation of the denture- supporting anatomy, and, in addition, is characterized by the early onset of systemic disease interactions, patient management, and/or lifestyle considerations. 0 Residual bone height of 16 to 20 mrn measured at the least vertical height of the mandible on a panoramic radiograph. 0 Residual ridge morphology that resists horizontal and vertical movement of the denture base; Type A or B maxilla.

Reevaluation of classification status should be considered following preprosthetic surgery. Retrospective analysis on a post treatment basis may alter a patient’s classification. Closing Statement The classification system for complete edentulism is based on the most objective criteria available to facilitate uniform utilization of the system. With such standardization, communication will be improved among dental professionals and third parties. This classification system will help to identify those patients most likely to require treatment by a specialist or by a practitioner with additional training and experience in advanced techniques. This system should also be valuable to research protocols as different treatment procedures are evaluated.

"Cancer mortality in the elderly in 11 countries worldwide, 1970–2015","G. Carioli1, M. Malvezzi, P. Bertuccio, D. Hashim, S. Waxman, E. Negri, P. Boffetta & C. La Vecchia","Background:Population ageing results in an increasing cancer burden in the elderly. We aimed to evaluate time-trends in cancer mortality for adults aged 65 and over for 17 major cancer types and all cancers combined in 11 countries worldwide over the period 1970–2015.Materials and methods:We obtained cancer death certification and population figures from the WHO and PAHO databases.We computed age-standardised (world standard population) rates for individuals aged 65 and over, and applied joinpoint regression models.Results:Age-standardised mortality rates for all cancers combined showed a heterogeneous, but widespread decline. Lung Cancer mortality rates have been decreasing among men, and increasing among women. Pancreatic cancer had unfavourable trends in all countries for both sexes. Despite variability across countries, other tobacco-related cancers (except kidney) showed overall favourable trends, except in Poland and Russia. Age-standardised mortality rates from stomach cancer have been declining in all countries for both sexes. Colorectal mortality has been declining, except in Poland and Russia. Liver cancer mortality increased in all countries, except in Japan, France and Italy, which had the highest rates in the past. Breast cancer mortality decreased for most countries, except for Japan, Poland and Russia. Trends for age-standardised uterine cancer rates in the USA, Canada and the UK were increasing over the last decade. Ovarian cancer rates showed declines in most countries. With The exception of Russia, prostate cancer rates showed overall declines. Lymphoid neoplasms rates have been declining in bothsexes, except in Poland and Russia.Conclusion:Over the last decades, age-standardised cancer mortality in the elderly has been decreasing in major countries worldwide and for major cancer sites, with the major exception of lung and uterine cancer in women and liver, pancreatic and kidney cancers in both sexes. Cancer mortality for the elderly in central and eastern Europe remains comparatively high.Keywords:cancer, mortality rates, elderly, worldwide","Introduction In 2012, almost 50% of all new cancer cases globally were diagnosed among the elderly, defined as individuals aged 65 or more[1]. Worldwide absolute numbers of incident cancers in the elderly are predicted to double in 2035 compared with 2012, reaching 14 million new cases [1].Cancer mortality in the elderly began to decrease in the late 1980s and early 1990s in North America, several countries from western Europe and Japan (women) [2–4]; however, systematic analysis of trends in the last two decades are not available.Given the ageing of the population, and the different cancer rates and trends in various age groups, the public health impact of cancer in the elderly is of major interest and relevance.Moreover, cancer burden in the elderly strongly affects healthcare resources, and its growth represents a public health and clinical priority. We aim to analyse trends in cancer mortality in the elderly since 1970 in 11 countries worldwide. Materials and methods From the World Health Organization (WHO) database [5], we obtain official death certification data for all cancers combined and 17 major cancer types: cancers of oral cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, stomach,colorectum, primary liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, breast, uterus (WHO death certification data do not allow to distinguish between cervical and corpus uteri cancer), ovary, prostate, bladder and kidney and other urinary sites, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma and leukaemia. We retrieved mortality figures for 11 major countries with over 20 million inhabitants and over 95% death certification coverage, i.e. the United States of America (USA), Canada, Argentina, Japan, Australia,the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, France, Italy, Poland and the Russian Federation over the period 1970–2015 (or the most recent available year). During the calendar period considered three differentRevisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) were used(ICD 8 through 10) [6–8], which were recoded according to ICD-10 [8].We obtained estimates of the resident population for the correspondingcalendar periods, based on official censuses, from the WHO and, for theAmericas, from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) data-bases [9].We calculated age-specific mortality rates for each 5-year age group(from 65–69 to 80þyears for the USA and Canada, and up to 85þfor theother countries), as well as age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs),using the world standard population [10].To identify years in which changes in ASMRs occurred, we appliedjoinpoint regression models [11], setting a maximum of five trend seg-ments. We computed the estimated annual percent change (APC) foreach of the trends identified by the joinpoint model and the overall aver-age annual percent change (AAPC) [12,13].ResultsTable1for men and Table2for women show ASMRs per 100 000elderly men and women, by cancer type and country, in the quin-quennia 2000–2004 (2002) and 2010–2014 (2012), along withcorresponding percent changes. Figure1a–f andsupplementaryTable S1(available atAnnals of Oncologyonline)(men) and S2(women) show results of the joinpoint analysis of ASMRs, bycancer type and country.All cancersAge-standardised mortality trends in most recent periods weredecreasing in all countries and more favourable in absolute termsin men than in women. Men in the USA and Canada had lowerrates compared with the other countries. Joinpoint regressionanalysis shows favourable APCs in the last trend segment, rangedbetween1% (Argentina) and2% (Canada and France).ASMRs in women were much lower compared with those ofmen. All countries showed falls in rates between 2002 and 2012also for women, with Japan having the lowest rate.In the following, we describe in detail the age-standardisedtrends for the four major cancers. Details on the other cancersincluded in the analysis are presented in thesupplementaryAppendix(available atAnnals of Oncologyonline).Colorectal cancerPercent changes between 2002 and 2012 for men in Argentina,Poland and Russia were unfavourable. Age-standardised trendsfrom Japan and Germany decreased since around 1990. Rates forPoland steadily increased since 1972, reaching in 2012 the highestvalue (199.5/100 000). Russian mortality rates increased up to2009, then plateaued, however, having the second highest rate of173.9. The USA had the lowest age-standardised mortality ratefor men in 2012 with a value of 86.5 and the most favourabledeclining trend between 2002 and 2012. Women showed down-ward trends between 2002 and 2012 for all countries, exceptRussia, which also had the highest age-standardised rate in 2012,102.7/100 000, followed by Poland (100.8). Declines betweenquinquennia were particularly marked in the USA, which alsohad the lowest rate in 2012 (60.7/100 000), and in Germany.Lung cancerIn men, patterns for this cancer site showed increases up toaround the 1990s (for Australia and the UK the rise ended ear-lier), to decrease thereafter. ASMRs in Argentina fell over thewhole period (AAPC:0.8) and rates for the USA had a 24.1%decrease since 2002, reaching a rate around 300/100 000 men in2012. Poland had the highest rate in 2012, 440.3/100 000 men,followed by Russia, 334.8 and Italy, 327.0. ASMRs for womenwere unfavourable in all countries, with the exception of theUSA. US women had 11.8% decrease since 2002, but still had ahigh rate in 2012, 193.7/100 000. Women in Canada reached thehighest rate in 2012 (209.1/100 000,þ6.3% since 2002). InRussian women, lung cancer rate was the lowest, with a value of39.5 and a 5.8% decrease since 2002.Breast cancerWomen from Japan and Poland had increasing age-standardisedtrends over the whole period (AAPC: 2.2 and 1.2, respectively).Poland had a 6.9% rise between 2002 and 2012 and a rate of 83.6in 2012. Russia had a 10.3% rise with a rate of 86.1/100 000 in2012. Japanese rates in women increased by 33% from 2002 to2012, however maintaining the lowest rate in 2012 (37.1/100 000). In the other countries patterns started to be favourablearound the 1990s and continued up to the most recent availableyear. Consequently, there is a systematic levelling of breast cancerASMRs in various areas of the world.Prostate cancerNorth America, Argentina, Australia and European countries(except Poland) after rises up to around the 1990s showed stron-ger decreases in ASMRs. Poland and Russia had overall unfavour-able trends, with corresponding high rates in 2012. An increase of37.3% was registered for Russian men between 2002 and 2012.Japan showed the lowest rates over the whole period withdecreasing rates between 2002 and 2012 (9.8%), reaching 61.6/100 000 men in 2012.Discussion The present analysis shows that cancer mortality patterns havebeen decreasing among the elderly in the last few decades, eventhough there are substantial differences across countries world-wide. Liver, pancreas, kidney and, in women, lung and uterus displayed less favourable trends. Central and eastern Europeancountries, particularly Poland and Russia, tended to have less fa-vourable trends in rates.We selected 11 countries worldwide with long-term valid can-cer death certification data. Still, some steep variation, likely dueto changes in the adoption of subsequent ICD Revisions andrelated coding instructions, are apparent (Japan, around 1995;Italy, around 1975).Overall, mortality rates in women were lower than in men.Different smoking patterns in the past in the two sexes play a keyrole on trends of tobacco-related cancers [14,15]; however, dif-ferences in dietary patterns, alcohol consumption, lifestyle habits,as well as occupational exposure probably influence the more fa-vourable rates in women; however, declines in most recent peri-ods were in general more marked in men. The less favourable trends in eastern Europe could be due to delays in therapeutic advancement adoption, unfavourable smoking habits, and dietary habits and other lifestyle factors [16,17].Trends for lung (and other tobacco-related) cancers reflect different smoking patterns in the two sexes [14]. Since the 2000s, the epidemic of lung cancer in men started to level off in most European countries, and to appreciably decline in North America And in the UK [4]. This is due to the declines in smoking prevalence over generations of men. In contrast, the prevalence of smoking in women increased during or after the Second World War in the UK and USA, and in the 1970s in most other countries, i.e. in generation born between the 1930s and 1950s [18]and middle aged and elderly men tended to quit smoking more than women. Thus, lung cancer rates in women are still upwards in various areas of the world [19]. This highlights the need of further improvements in tobacco control, particularly in women.Changing tobacco habits across generations also partly explains trends in other major tobacco-related cancers, i.e. head and neck and oesophagus. For these neoplasms, the major decreases registered in France and Italy also reflect the substantial declines in alcohol drinking among men in those countries [20,21].Among other strongly tobacco-related cancers, trends are favorable also for bladder, but not for pancreas, which did not show favourable trends among most considered countries, in the elderly as likely in middle aged population [22,23]. The reason for the unfavourable trends for pancreatic cancer remains, how-ever, largely undefined [24].Over the last three decades, improvements in breast cancer management (screening, early diagnosis and mainly treatment)favourably influenced the worldwide mortality trends [25–27].Downward trends were observed in elderly women, even if less marked compared with younger ages [26]. At elderly ages, characteristics of this neoplasm are different and comorbidities could make undergoing therapies and surgeries difficult for these patients. Rises in incidence in Asian countries [28] could explain the increasing trend in Japan, which however started from the lowest rates. Increasing trends in Poland and Russia indicate the need to improve breast cancer management in those countries.The favourable trends for stomach cancer in both sexes is probably due to the lower prevalence in Helicobacter Pylori Infection Across generations, more affluent and healthy diet, better food conservation and more hygienic food handling, as well as reduced prevalence of tobacco use in men [29,30]. The comparatively high rates in Japan, eastern Europe and Italy call for intervention on these risk factors.Improvements in management of colorectal cancer, in particular in screening and removal of adenomas, have positively influenced incidence and mortality for this neoplasm [31]. Besides Baseline incidence, related to nutrition, diet and other lifestyle factors, variability across countries could be explained by different access in treatments and different patterns in risk factors [32].Liver cancer is a common site of metastasis, and often cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis are recognised as causes of deaths instead of the tumour itself, for these reasons liver cancer is difficult to correctly diagnose; however, besides the inaccuracies and the effect of changes in criteria of cancer deaths classifications, mortality trends from liver cancer also reflect the different impact of hepatitis and alcohol consumption worldwide. In Japan, where rates have risen in the past [33], control of HCV is probably the main determinant of the decline in rates. In North America, the prevalence of hepatitis C has increased, while in Italy, both HBV and HCV have been declining. Newer antiviral treatment of HCV is likely to favourable affect future liver cancer trends. Rises in rates in Germany and the UK, and decreases in France, likely reflect the different patterns in alcohol consumption and the rise of obesity, too [34].The favourable trends in ovarian cancer in North America, the UK and few other European countries have been partly or largely attributed to the use of oral contraceptives and the cessation of hormone replacement therapy use following the Women's Health Initiative report in 2002 [35], which in those countries became common in women born since 1930s [36].The decrease in uterine cancer mortality are due to declines in cervical cancer rates following the adoption of the Pap smear test;however, WHO data do not allow distinguish between cervix and corpus uteri and hence interpretation of the levelling of rates among considered countries is limited.After early rises due to better diagnosis and certification, mortality for lymphomas, multiple myeloma and leukaemias has levelled off in most countries over the recent decades. This reflects some impact in improved treatment of lymphoid neoplasms, in the elderly too [37,38].Cancer management in elderly populations is a challenge.Changes in criteria for cancer death diagnosis and inaccuracy encoding and classification, in particular for this age group, likely have affected mortality and incidence trends over time; however,quantifying the consequences of uncertainties in cancer death certifications on observed changes in rates remains difficult.Recently, improvements in early diagnosis and cancer death classification have influenced incidence data, but their role on mortality trends is still controversial due to the complex and heterogeneous health conditions in the elderly (comorbidities, multiple drug use,etc.). Therefore, difficulties in cancer care for older persons and their frailty caused their exclusion from clinical trials and a paucity of data on cancer management in the literature.Funding This work was conducted with the contribution of the Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC, project N. 18440), MIUR (Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell'Universita` e della Ricerca),with an SIR (Scientific Independence of Young Researchers) 2014 grant (project RBSI1465UH) and an AIRC Fellowship for Italy‘Laura Dubini’—Rif 22719.Disclosure All authors have declared no conflicts of interest.",-,"1.

Rheumatoid arthritis in the elderly: Characteristics and treatment considerations,"Lina Serhal, May N. Lwin, Christopher Holroyd, Christopher J. Edwards","The elderly rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population consists of both elderly-onset RA that manifests after the age of 60 and individuals diagnosed with RA early in life who age naturally to become members of this group. The Elderly A population is expanding due to both increased life expectancy and an increased incidence of elderly onset RA. Elderly onset RA seems to have a characteristic clinical pattern and perhaps biological profile different to that of early onset RA. The management of RA in elderly patients can be challenging, as robust treat-to-target approaches must be balanced against the adverse events due to increased comorbidities in old age. This produces a tendency to prefer less aggressive treatment in elderly RA patients in clinical practice. Despite the concerns about adverse events, there is limited evidence on the best way to approach RA in this population, as elderly patients are often not well presented in the clinical trials. Herein, we review the literature to assess the efficacy and safety of RA therapies in this age group. We then suggest a tailored approach that can be adopted in clinical practice, based on the disease severity and risk profiles of elderly RA patients. Keywords: Rheumatoid arthritis Elderly onset Elderly Biological age Comorbidities Treatment","1. Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting synovial tissue and leading to joint destruction and disability [1]. The population of elderly patients with RA consists of patients with elderly onset RA that manifests after age 60 and elderly patients who presented with young onset RA earlier in life [2]. The Elderly A population is expanding, mainly due to population aging with increased life expectancy and to an increasing incidence of elderly onset RA [3, 4].The immune system changes with age through a process known as immunosenescence. There is growing evidence that the immune system in RA patients undergoes accelerated and premature aging [5]. The Aging process affects both the innate and the adaptive immune systems.The innate immune system becomes non-specifically active with age,thus contributing to increased chronic inflammation and comorbidities[6]. The adaptive immune system becomes functionally defective and undergoes phenotypic changes with age, contributing to the break-down of immunological tolerance which contributes to an increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases [6]. Both healthy elderly individuals and RA patients of all ages share features of immunosenescence that contribute to increased comorbidities [5][7].Patients with elderly onset RA have a higher prevalence of associated comorbidities than patients with young-onset RA, perhaps due to the effect of both RA and older age on the immune aging process [8].Elderly onset RA seems to have a characteristic pattern with more acute onset, systemic involvement and worse functional outcomes than young onset RA [9]. Therefore, weighing the benefits of a robust treat-to-target RA approach against the risks of adverse events due to increased comorbidities is challenging in this age group (Fig. 1). Concerns About adverse events may influence therapeutic decisions with clinicians often preferring a less aggressive approach in elderly patients[10]. Despite these concerns there is limited evidence on the best way to approach treatment as elderly patients are often not well represented in clinical trials due to age restrictions or to the presence of comorbidities, such as infections, cancers and renal, liver and lung diseases [11].We have reviewed the literature to determine whether elderly onset RA patients have a unique biological profile that might suggest specific therapeutic strategies and whether RA therapies in this age group display a particular benefit-risk profile when assessed in real-world cohort studies. Although additional clinical studies in elderly RA patients are needed, this review attempts to suggest a tailored approach that we could adopt in our real-life daily clinical practice. 2. Is the immune system different as we age?The immune system is highly susceptible to the aging process, also known as immunosenescence [7]. This immune aging is associated with increased susceptibility to infections, cancer and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [7, 12].2.1. Immunosenescence Aging affects all cells of the immune system but T cells appear to be the most prominently affected [6]. The emergence of senescent T cells in the periphery is a physiological aging process demonstrated in healthy individuals. In fact, the generation of new T cells declines with age. To compensate for this decline, the T cells in the periphery continuously proliferate and subsequently become exhausted and senescent[5]. Senescent T cells are characterised by a contracted T cell receptor(TCR) repertoire and loss of CD28 expression (Fig. 2)[5]. In fact, the presence of CD28 on T cells plays a pivotal role in self-tolerance when it binds to the B7 molecule on dendritic cell surface [5]. Hence, the presence of CD28 negative T cells (CD28- T cells) contributes to the reduced immune tolerance with age and subsequently increased incidence of autoimmune diseases, such as RA where a similar T cell phenotype is described [5, 13]. This could be an interesting field of future studies to assess whether we could stratify elderly RA patients to specific therapies, for instance T cell targeted RA therapies.2.2. Reduced adaptive but increased tissue-damaging innate immunity Immunosenescence is associated with reduced adaptive immunity but increased tissue-damaging nonspecific innate immunity leading to chronic tissue inflammation or‘inflammaging’and increased susceptibility to infections, cancers and autoimmunity [7, 12]. This is important to consider when treating elderly RA patients, who are likely to have an increased infectious risk.The immune response to injury is defective in the elderly population by favouring proinflammatory CD4+ T cells and M1 macrophages,which contributes to defective tissue repair, bone loss and increased arthritis susceptibility [14, 15]. Moreover, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFαis predictive of mortality in healthy elderly individuals and contributes to some diseases in aged individuals [14, 16]. For instance, TNFαplays a direct role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's Disease, whereas high levels of IL-6 may be a risk factor for thromboembolic events in aged individuals [14].3. RA and immunosenescence is characterised by inappropriately accelerated immunosenescence,which is present early in the RA disease course, and is independent of the disease duration [6, 13]. The decline of thymic output, loss of T cell diversity and T cell aging are premature by 20 to30 years in RA compared to age matched healthy individuals (Fig. 2)[7, 5, 13].At a cellular level, the hallmark features of immune aging in RAinclude: i) premature shortening of chromosome telomeres with each cell division of all T cells including naïve cells, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest with impaired clonal expansion, cellular senescence with impaired regeneration and altered cellular function [13, 17], ii) decline in the quality and efficiency of DNA repair, enhancing progressive accumulation of DNA damage and ultimately premature senescence or apoptosis that possibly leads to lymphopenia [17], iii) increase of CD28- T cells promoting more severe and systemic disease where CD28-T cells are markedly increased with extra-articular complications and found to be associated with atherosclerotic disease in RA [5], iv) disturbed induction of regulatory CD4+ T cells [15] and v) metabolic reprogramming of the dysfunctional senescent T cells contributing to a proliferation bias towards effector T cells with proinflammatory functions [7]. This could represent an important area to direct future studies to assess the possibility of resetting the immune system, perhaps by populating it with young and adaptable lymphocytes [13].Whether immunosenescence in RA is primary or secondary to chronic inflammation is not clear. However, premature aging of naïveas well as memory T cells and the faster telomere erosion of healthy individuals who share HLA-DR4 with RA patients raise the hypothesis of probable primary immune aging in RA [18].4. Is RA different in old age?Both elderly individuals in the general population and RA patients of all ages show senescence-associated features of the immune system(Fig. 2). It is well known that molecular changes in RA exist years before RA onset and although the disease aetiology is not yet fully understood, it results from exposure to a combination of environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals [19]. However, the reason why RA starts at different ages is not clear. The population of elderly onset RA is expanding and represents one third of the total RNA population [2]. In fact, a study from the US showed that over one decade, the incidence of elderly onset RA has increased and the average age of onset increased from 50 to 60 years [2].4.1. Elderly onset versus young onset RA (Fig. 3)Elderly onset RA appears to have a characteristic presentation with more male prevalence, acute onset, systemic features, large and proximal joint involvement with polymyalgia rheumatica-like symptoms,less rheumatoid factor positivity and worse functional outcomes than young onset RA [9]. Elderly onset RA may also have a different proinflammatory cytokine profile compared to young onset RA; in Taiwanese cohort, elderly onset RA patients showed significantly higher IL-6 and lower TNFαlevels in peripheral blood. High IL-6 levels were associated with male preponderance, high CRP and PMR-like symptoms, whilst high TNFαlevels were associated with constitutional symptoms and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positivity[20]. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions from one study, this constitutes an important field for future studies to assess the efficacy of a stratified approach to selection of biological therapies in this agegroup.In addition, ESR increases with age and this could interfere with the interpretation of the RA disease activity score DAS28 (ESR). Although DAS28 (ESR) has been found to be reliable to assess disease activity in moderate to severe RA regardless of age and sex, remission rates could be underestimated in elderly men with DAS28 (ESR) less than 3.1 [21].4.2. Elderly onset RA: Different environmental exposure/genetic associations?It seems likely that the current older population have been exposed to different environmental factors than the young population. Smoking And delayed menarche are known risk factors for the development ofRA [ 22, 23]. Smoking consumption in Britain increased markedly until it reached a peak of 50% in 1970; afterwards, it began to fall dramatically to 25% in 1998 and then steadily down to 14.4% in 2018[24, 25]. Likewise, menarche onset showed a downward trend over decades, around 3 to 4 months per decade [26]. The genetic associations with RA were analysed after stratification of patients by age [27].This showed that HLA-DRB1 phenotype frequencies differ between early onset and elderly onset RA [27]. This could reflect the fact that different combinations of environmental and genetic factors may have contributed to the development of, and increased incidence of elderly onset RA.5. Biological age and Biological age reflects the degree of physical and mental function-ality of the elderly when compared with chronologically aged individuals, and it differs widely among the elderly population.Unsuccessful aging occurs when biological age exceeds chronological age [ 17]. Multiple factors count for this discrepancy, including geriatric syndromes, comorbidities, polypharmacy and frailty (Fig. 3). This Makes it complicated, but crucial to look at, when often complex treatment is considered in elderly RA patients.5.1. Geriatric Syndromes (GS)The Term GS is a well-known geriatric term and is defined as multifactorial health conditions that make an elderly individual vulnerable to health or social challenges, and thus GS accounts for unsuccessful aging and frailty of elderly people [28]. It consists of multiple and interrelated factors such as cognitive impairment, depression, fall, in-continence, sensory limitations and malnutrition [29].5.1.1. Geriatric syndrome and RAA strong interrelation between GS and RA exists. RA is frequently associated with depression, cognitive impairment and falls, and RA patients have higher disability than age matched populations [30–32].Higher disease activity and longer-term RA are found to be risk factors for developing GS in elderly patients [29]. In addition, anaemia of chronic disease is more frequently encountered in elderly RA patients with GS, which further enhances functional impairment and cognitive dysfunction, leading to further disability and a trend towards increased depression in elderly RA patients [29,33]. Thus, GS in elderly contributes to malnutrition, which in turn worsens RA activity and functional outcomes [34]. One could therefore suggest that efficient RAtreatment would help to improve physical and mental outcomes in elderly RA patients.5.1.2. Cognitive dysfunction in Chronic systemic inflammation such as that seen in RA is an important risk for developing cognitive dysfunction, which is found to be associated with more functional limitations, depression and pain[35, 36]. In fact, RA is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's Disease and vascular dementia, particularly in elderly patients who themselves have more cardiovascular risk factors, hence this can further increase the risk [37,38]. Moreover, it is suggested that RA treatment has a protective effect on cognitive function [37]. This is supported by real-world data from Germany where the mental health of RA patients significantly improved with effective treatment (assessed with Short Form-36 Mental Component score that includes vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and emotional well-being) [39]. Nevertheless,cognitive dysfunction could be underestimated in RA, which might affect the compliance and subsequently the response of elderly patients to treatment [29]. 5.2. Comorbidities The prevalence of comorbidities is higher in the general elderly population but is even higher in those with elderly onset RA [17, 40,8].Higher numbers of comorbid conditions in RA patients is associated with lower response to RA treatment and greater mortality risk, perhaps indicating that comorbidities in RA might be linked to autoimmune mechanisms [39, 41,42].5.2.1. Cardiovascular disease It is well established that atherosclerosis and eventually cardiovascular disease are accelerated in RA [43]. Cardiovascular diseases largely contribute to the increased mortality in RA [44]. In fact, cardiovascular morbidity is doubled and cardiovascular mortality is increased by 60% in RA patients, with congestive heart failure and ischemic heart disease constituting the main contributors to overall increased mortality in RA [45–47]. Inflammatory arthritis and atherosclerosis are thought to have the same inflammatory pathogenesis, further supported by the observed reduction in cardiovascular morbidity with effective treatment of RA patients in population-based studies [48,49]. Thus,inflammation is a well-known cardiovascular risk, particularly with increased age where age-related elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and CRP might be partly responsible for the increased cardiovascular risk [17]. Moreover, traditional cardiovascular risk factors and the use of steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in RA patients.Despite this cardiovascular risk management of RA patients remains unsatisfactory [43, 50].5.2.2. Infections Infection is a major concern in RA and is one of the leading causes of premature death in RA patients, especially with increased age [51, 52].Age has been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for serious infections in patients with RA [52]. In fact, the features of immunosenescence leading to defective protection against infections and associated immune compromising comorbidities in RA are further accelerated in elderly patients [6, 40]. Elderly onset RA patients often have greater disease activity leading to early disability and eventually increased immobility, which is a strong risk for infections such as respiratory and urogenital infections [8, 53]. In addition, the use of immunomodulatory treatment further increases the risk of infection in RA patients [54].5.2.3. Malignancies Cancer contributes to the increased mortality in RA patients [44].RA is an independent risk factor for developing malignancies where overall malignancy risk is increased compared to the general population, particularly lymphoma and lung cancer [55, 56]. The immune aging process in RA might contribute to this risk, notably due to the presence of chronic inflammation and defective DNA repair [17]. The Malignancy risk attributable to the use of immunosuppressant therapy in RA is debatable. While the use of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and biological DMARDs(bDMARDs) in RA seems to be safe overall with regards to malignancy,the risk of melanoma may be slightly increased [54]. Accordingly, it is important to consider this when treating rheumatic diseases, particularly in elderly patients since the incidence of many cancer types characteristically increases with age [57].5.2.4. Lung disease Lung disease is prevalent in RA patients and may be related to the disease itself, comorbidities, drug therapy or a combination of these factors. It is suggested that chronic lung injury in genetically predisposed individuals leads to RA-related lung changes, where chronic infections and smoking are important contributing factors [58]. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is increased in RA patients when compared to the general population with a HR of 9.0 (CI 95% 4.0–19.9) [59]. RA-related ILD is associated with a significantly increased mortality when compared to RA patients without ILD [60]. The risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in RA is not well established; a meta-analysis demonstrated a statistically significant increased risk of subsequent development of COPD in RA patients, where the HR in RA patients versus control group was 2.0 (CI 95% 1.6–2.5)[61]. Smoking, which is an established risk factor for RA, might strongly contribute to this association. This further affects the disease management in elderly patients, where risks and benefits of RAW therapies must be carefully weighed.5.3. Polypharmacy Polypharmacy is frequently encountered in elderly patients with RAas a result of increased comorbidities. This makes it difficult to optimise the often-complicated RA treatment protocols in this age group, with an increased likelihood of drug interactions, adverse events and contraindications due to hepatic and renal dysfunction. Nevertheless, it is crucial to weigh risks and benefits before initiating treatment in elderly patients, where effective treatment has been proven to reduce mortality, not least by reducing the need for steroids [41].6. Do we treat elderly patients in the same way as young patients with RA?Increased age remains a significant barrier to a successful treat-to-target approach in elderly patients with RA. A survey conducted in the US concluded that the treatment recommendations of rheumatologists are affected by age, preferring less aggressive treatment for elderly patients [10]. Likewise, data from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for Rheumatoid Arthritis (BSRBR-RA) showed that young patients with RA have higher rates of switching between DMARDs than elderly patients, regardless of the biologic class [62].Although data from a large Early RA Network (ERAN) cohort of patients found that the time for first outpatient visit and the initiation of treatment within 3 months was not biased by age, elderly patients were exposed to more steroid use and monotherapy with cs DMARDs rather than combinations of cs DMARDs or bDMARDs over 2 years than their younger counterparts [63].A population-based study demonstrated that age is a significant predictor of failure to use any DMARDS (synthetic or biologic) in the first 12 months, where half of the RA patients aged between 65 and 75 and less than third of RA patients aged more than 75 years received DMARDs [64]. Although the use of methotrexate was found more commonly in elderly onset compared to young onset RA in another cohort study, the weekly dose was considerably lower [40]. Similarly,the use of multiple csDMARDs or bDMARDs in elderly RA patients was markedly lower compared to young patients, where the decision was not related to the disease activity, the disease duration or the presence of comorbidities [40,42, 65]. However, the use of prednisolone is slightly more frequent in elderly onset RA when compared to young onset RA, even though its use has been shown to increase cardiovascular risk in elderly patients [41,42].7. Do RA therapies work in elderly patients?There is a growing evidence that the majority of RA therapies are similarly effective in elderly when compared to young patients.Conventional synthetic DMARDs display a similar efficacy profile among all age groups [66]. However, a lower maintenance dose of methotrexate might be effective in elderly patients and thus dose adjustment might be sometimes required [67]. This is mainly owing to age-related changes in pharmacokinetics with subsequent reduced renal clearance [66, 67]. With regards to bDMARDs, it seems that the efficacy is likely to be comparable among all age groups. In fact, a large Japanese cohort of RA patients showed similar clinical improvement at 48 weeks and drug maintenance rates between patients with young onset and elderly onset RA after initiation of bDMARDs [68].Tumour Necrosis Factor inhibitors (TNFi) appear to be effective in elderly patients with RA, although a large cohort of RA patients from the BSRBR showed that elderly patients of 75 years or more were less likely to discontinue TNF monotherapy due to inefficacy and more likely to discontinue therapy due to adverse events, when compared to younger population [69]. This may reflect a decline in immunogenicity associated with immune aging changes. In addition, post-hoc analysis of four controlled studies and two long extension studies of etanercept in early and late stage RA showed that, although elderly patients tended to have a less robust response than young patients, the pattern of clinical and radiological response was comparable and sustained in both age groups [70–73]. Etanercept combined with methotrexate resulted in greater efficacy than either therapy alone in elderly patients with late stage RA but they were equally effective in elderly patients with early RA [ 73–75]. Notably, elderly RA patients tended to have higher dis-ability at baseline than young patients but showed greater functional improvement with etanercept [73]. Nonetheless, etanercept displayed asimilar efficacy profile among all age groups when results of a large cohort of patients from five open-label and four double-blind randomized controlled trials were analysed [76]. Likewise, real-world data analysis from different countries including British, Swiss and US registries proved that the efficacy of TNF was similar in young and elderly RA patients, though slightly less significant in elderly patients from the Dutch RA monitoring registry [77–80]. Nevertheless, elderly patients of more than 70 years from the Swiss cohort showed clin-ical but not functional improvement with TNFi, perhaps due to associated comorbidities and osteoarthritis [78].Abatacept displayed a favourable benefit profile in elderly RA patients with the highest retention rate among seven other bDMARDs for clinical response and tolerability in a Japanese multi-centre cohort[81]. Furthermore, a French population-based study demonstrated that elderly RA patients of more than 75 years who had higher disease activity at baseline than young patients benefit as much, if not more from abatacept over a 2-year follow-up period [82]. Likewise, oral Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKi) namely tofacitinib and baricitinib displayed similar efficacy in young and elderly RA patients in recent clinical trials[83, 84].The efficacy of tocilizumab and rituximab may be less in elderly patients.A French study showed that among 222 RA patients treated with tocilizumab, 61 patients were more than 65 years and had significantly lower clinical response and remission rate when compared to young patients (40% vs. 61% and 28 vs 46%, respectively;p< .05)[85]. Another French study analysed the efficacy of rituximab and showed that, although all age groups displayed similar clinical responses, patients between 65 and 75 years were more likely to respond than patients of more than 75 years over a 1-year follow-up period (OR3.81, 95% CI 1.14–12.79) [86]. Nevertheless, larger studies are needed before drawing concrete conclusions in this regard.8. Do therapies for RA improve comorbidities?Since RA and atherosclerosis share a similar inflammatory pathogenesis, it is suggested that RA treatment might have an anti-atherogenic activity [87, 88]. In fact, a beneficial effect of methotrexate and adalimumab on lipoprotein functions and macrophage cholesterol metabolism has been demonstrated in vitro [89]. Furthermore, the risk of cardiovascular disease seems to be higher in rheumatoid factor positive and is not just related to traditional cardiovascular risk factors [90].This might explain the reduced cardiovascular risk and overall mortality with effective RA treatment described with methotrexate, TNF and rituximab [41, 43,49, 53, 91]. Nevertheless, the protective effect of DMARDs against congestive heart failure via their anti-inflammatory effect is controversial and needs further understanding [92]. It is important to mention that steroid use of more than 5 mg/day is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risks and eventually mortality in a dose-dependent manner, and is a potential risk for cognitive dysfunction in the elderly [38, 41,42]. Therefore, increased age should not deprive elderly RA patients of effective treatments if there are no contraindications, to help reduce the need for steroids and improve functional outcomes, thus reducing cardiovascular risk and overall mortality.9. Are adverse events associated with treatment the same for elderly patients with RA?There is increasing evidence that RA therapies are similarly tolerable and safe in elderly compared to young RA patients.Hydroxychloroquine appears to be the least toxic csDMARD in elderly patients [93]. Unlike the length of use and the cumulative dose,increased age was not found to be an independent risk for development of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy [94]. Methotrexate seems to be better tolerated than sulfasalazine in elderly RA patients, where after 5 years, almost three quarters of patients continued methotrexate and half continued sulfasalazine [93]. The drug discontinuation was mainly due to gastrointestinal, hepatic, cutaneous and possibly lung side effects with methotrexate and gastrointestinal side effects with sulfasalazine[93].The safety of biological DMARDs appears similar for elderly and young RA patients, where most evidence exists for TNFi and abatacept.In fact, Swiss and Dutch biologic registries have provided a reassuringsafety profile of TNFi in elderly RA patients that is comparable to younger patients [78, 80]. Although data from controlled clinical trial of etanercept showed that the rates of serious adverse events, serious infection episodes and cancer were slightly higher in the elderly group,the risk did not increase beyond that imposed by increased age and comorbidities [73,76]. Abatacept showed the lowest discontinuation rate after adverse events in elderly patients enrolled in a Japanese Registry, perhaps due to a steroid sparing effect, with a one third reduction of steroid users receiving abatacept demonstrated in a French Cohort study [81, 82].Nevertheless, the risk of infection with bDMARDs might increase in elderly RA due to the decline of the immune system over the years. Infact, the increased risk of serious infection with TNFi in RA patients enrolled in the German biologic register was associated with increased age of more than 60 years, active disease, high steroid use and comorbidities such as chronic renal and lung disease [53]. Furthermore,the presence of comorbidities was a predictor of adverse events at the start of bDMARDs based on the findings of European biologic registries[95]. The risk of subsequent infection with bDMARDs among RA patients who had previous infection on TNFi was assessed in a large cohort study from the US (mean age across biologic exposure was 64 to 69 years) [96]. This showed that the risk, when compared to that of infliximab, was significantly lower with abatacept (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64–0.99) and Etanercept (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.97) [96]. It is difficult to predict the infectious risk associated with TNFi in elderly patients, but this must be balanced against the risks of high steroid use,active disease, presence of comorbidities and previous infection history that are more commonly encountered in elderly patients.Data for other bDMARDs are limited. Rituximab was associated with numerically higher infection rates in elderly RA patients in a French Cohort study [86]. Likewise, tofacitinib and baricitinib were associated with numerically higher rates of serious infections and herpes zoster infections in elderly versus younger RA patients in the clinical controlled trials [83][84]. Based on the summary of product characteristics (SmPC), patients aged over 75 years starting on baricitinib might use the reduced dose of 2mg instead of 4 mg daily. Dose adjustment does not seem to be required for other bDMARDs, but caution when treating elderly RA patients, particularly women of more than 60 years with infliximab has been suggested. This was based on a large Swedish population-based cohort study that reported an increased incidence of cervical cancer with infliximab compared to bDMARD-naïve patients and the general population and hence, enhanced cervical screening is advised [97]. However, further clarification around this issue is required from other registry studies.10. What clinical approach should we adopt?There is no unique approach to adopt but treatment must be tailored to the profile of elderly RA patients (Fig. 4). We have attempted to suggest a tailored approach that can be adopted in daily clinical practice (Table 1).11. Conclusion To conclude, RA therapy seems to be generally effective and safe in elderly patients. Real-world data have shown that treatment of elderly patients is crucial although it remains unsatisfactory in clinical practice. This is likely due to lack of evidence and concerns about adverse events with often associated comorbidities, polypharmacy and cognitive dysfunction. Hence, the therapeutic approach must be balanced against the risk profile of the elderly patients and careful selection of the drug, adjustment of the dose and monitoring of the dis-ease are required.",-,"[1] Smolen J, Aletaha D, McInnes I.

Risk Factors for the Progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment to Dementia,"Noll L. Campbell, PharmD, Fred Unverzagt, PhD, Michael A. LaMantia, MD, MPH, Babar A. Khan, MD, MS, and Malaz A. Boustani, MD, MPH",Keywords Mild cognitive impairment; Dementia; Risk factors; Genetics; Biomarkers,"Introduction As identified in previously published articles, including those published in this issue, the detection of early cognitive impairment among older adult populations is worthy of diagnostic and clinical recognition. Several definitions and classifications have been applied to this form of cognitive impairment over time 1–4 including mild cognitive impairment (MCI),4–6 cognitive impairment no dementia,7,8 malignant senescent forgetfulness,9 and age-associated cognitive decline.10 Consistent with current usage this review uses the term MCI, and focuses on progression from MCI to dementia.Prevalence estimates of MCI among populations of community-dwelling older adults are as high as 22% of those aged 71 years and older,11 with prevalence rates among older adults cared for in memory care practices estimated at nearly 40%.12 The likelihood of progression from MCI to any form of dementia has been suggested to occur at a rate 3 to 5 times higher than those with normal cognition,4,13–15 with an annual rate of progression of 12% in the general population and up to 20% in populations at higher risk.11 As a transitional stage of early cognitive impairment, much attention has been focused on the identification of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors to prevent or delay the progression of MCI to dementia. Several known risk factors for the development of dementias have been identified, including age, genetic characteristics, lower educational attainment, and various clinical characteristics.16–20 Among those with MCI, several risk factors influencing the progression to dementia have been identified and are discussed in detail in this clinical review. Early studies aiming to prevent the onset of Alzheimer-type dementia among older adults with amnestic MCI have been reported, including a study using the only approved pharmacologic class in dementia, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or vitamin E. The investigators reported that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors did not delay the progression to Alzheimer-type dementia over 3 years, except in those who were carriers of an apolipoprotein ε4 (APOE ε4) allele.21 A second study evaluating donepezil in reducing the progression of MCI did not show significant improvement in cognition with higher adverse events and dropouts, but did not evaluate for the presence of APOE alleles or the diagnosis of dementia as an outcome.22 A second prevention study found that cognitive training did not delay the progression from MCI to dementia.23 Additional studies evaluating potential methods to delay or reduce the likelihood of progression from MCI to dementia have generally found no evidence of support for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or ginkgo biloba,24–26 further limiting the potential therapeutic options.To assist clinicians in understanding factors associated with the progression from MCI to dementia, this article reviews both markers of disease activity and clinical risk factors influencing the progression of MCI to dementia. Biomarkers and imaging characteristics have been extensively studied as pathologic indicators of neurologic disease. The authors first review the validity of biomarkers in monitoring the progression from MCI to dementia. Risk factors for the progression of MCI to dementia are then reviewed, and categorized as modifiable and nonmodifiable. Modifiable risk factors, such as cardiovascular risk factors, depression, or adverse drug effects, are defined as characteristics that, if manipulated (such as improved success at treatment goals), may modify the risk or rate of progression to dementia. Nonmodifiable risk factors are defined as risk factors that cannot be manipulated, such as demographic or genetic characteristics. Such categorization may provide a platform for future clinical interventions targeting modifiable risk factors to reduce the progression of MCI to dementia.Markers of Disease Process Imaging Progressive atrophy of the brain can be detected by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and has been shown to monitor the disease process in those developing Alzheimer-type dementia.27–30 Structural MRI has proven sensitivity in monitoring changes with aging,31–33 and is also sensitive to the detection of a more rapid rate of change as seen when cognitive symptoms progress to dementia.34 The patterns of change within various regions of the cortex have been shown to have predictive value for progressive cognitive impairment and Alzheimer-type dementia among those with MCI.35–37 A small study of Italian older adults with MCI found that atrophy of the medial temporal lobe identified on MRI was a better predictor of the progression from MCI to any form of dementia than were baseline neuropsychiatric assessments and demographic characteristics.38 White matter lesions (WML) are recognized as areas of higher signal intensity on MRI and are common in older adults, with higher frequencies among those with vascular risk factors.39–41 Compared with healthy controls, these lesions are progressively more extensive among those with MCI and both vascular and Alzheimer-type dementia.42,43 A higher severity of lesions has also been identified in those with worse cognitive impairment reported by neuropsychiatric assessment in comparison with healthy controls.41,44 A recent study by Devine and colleagues 45 evaluated the WML severity and the time to conversion to any form of dementia among a small group of older adults with MCI receiving care in a memory clinic in the United Kingdom. The investigators found no relationship between WML severity and the time to progression to dementia. Age and subtype of dementia were the only independent variables associated with a shorter time to conversion to dementia, noting that more advanced age and the amnestic subtype of MCI progressed to dementia sooner. As Alzheimer-type dementia was the primary type of dementia diagnosed in this group (62%), this result appears to be consistent with a recent review by Debette and Markus46 suggesting that WML reflect cardiovascular disease burden and are more consistently associated with an increased risk of the progression to vascular or mixed dementias, but not Alzheimer-type dementia. However, a recent article by Brickman and colleagues 47 shows an association between white matter hyperintensities and incident Alzheimer-type dementia in a population without MCI at baseline. The conflicting evidence underscores a lack of accepted opinion in this matter. In addition, a study by Bombois and colleagues 48 also supports the association of imaging with vascular and mixed dementia, noting that increasing amounts of subcortical hyperintensities were only associated with vascular or mixed dementias.Central and Peripheral Biomarkers Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, focusing on detection of Tau proteins and amyloid-β (Aβ) proteins, have also been studied as predictors of the progression of MCI to Alzheimer-type dementia.49–52 Because of their predictive value, structural MRI and CSF biomarkers have been used as outcome measures to increase trial power and reduce the sample-size burden.53,54 In addition, biomarkers have been incorporated into recently released recommendations from the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association for the recognition of MCI and stratification into diagnostic subtypes of MCI that better describe the risk of progression to Alzheimer-type dementias.55 Time to progression of MCI has been evaluated by CSF biomarkers and MRI results in 91 Dutch older adults with MCI who progressed to Alzheimer-type dementia.56 Predictors of time to progression of MCI to Alzheimer-type dementia included only atrophy of medial temporal lobe (hazard ratio [HR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–6.1; P = .03), whereas APOE ε4 genotype and Aβ1–42 were not associated with time to progression to Alzheimer-type dementia. This result suggests that markers of brain injury (such as Tau proteins or imaging results suggesting progressive neurologic damage), but not pathologic markers (such as Aβ1–42), may better predict the time to progression to Alzheimer-type dementia among older adults with MCI.56 Peripheral biomarkers have also been considered, given the challenges in acquiring CSF samples and translating CSF studies to the general population. To date the evaluation of  peripheral markers, including various species of cytokines,57–59 Aβ and other serum proteins, 60–68 and APOE ε isoforms,69 have not identified clear and reproducible peripheral biomarkers associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer-type dementia. Llano and colleagues 70 recently published on the use of data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging (ADNI) project to identify 5 plasma analytes with modest predictive value in differentiating subjects with Alzheimer-type dementia from normal controls (range of sensitivity and specificity 74%–85%). No signature panel was able to adequately predict the progression from MCI to Alzheimer-type dementia within this ADNI population. The investigators recognize that the signature panels have insufficient predictive value independently, but theorize that these groups of markers may have value in the future as part of a multicomponent predictive tool.A recent study by Choo and colleagues 71 pursued the hypothesis that combinations of biomarkers and imaging results would improve the prediction of progression to Alzheimer-type dementia among Swedish older adults with a diagnosis of MCI. After performing a stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis for the outcome of Alzheimer-type dementia only, the investigators reported parietal glucose metabolic rate and total Tau proteins predicted the progression from MCI to Alzheimer-type dementia. Although APOE genotype, a known predictor for dementia, did predict progression in univariate models, it did not add further predictive capability to the 2-predictor model in this cohort.Nonmodifiable Risk Factors Genetic Characteristics Long recognized as a risk factor for Alzheimer-type dementia and even MCI, the APOE ε4 allele has emerged as the most consistent genetic risk factor for the progression of MCI to Alzheimer-type dementia.72 A meta-analysis published in 2011 included data from 35 studies with more than 6000 subjects to evaluate this and other genetic risk factors.73 The meta-analysis reports that among those with MCI, carriers of any APOE ε4 allele are more than 2 times as likely to progress to Alzheimer-type dementia (Table 1). Homozygotes for the APOE ε4 allele had a 4-fold higher risk of progressing to Alzheimer-type dementia compared with non carriers. Of note, this review did not include results from the Nun study, which did not find an association between APOE status and the outcome of any dementia.74 Although the risk of Alzheimer-type dementia was found to be higher, the clinical utility of exclusively using APOE genotype to predict progression to dementia was attenuated by a low sensitivity and specificity (0.53 and 0.67, respectively).73 Rodriguez-Rodriguez and colleagues 75 studied the link between 8 genetic variants with the risk of progression to Alzheimer-type dementia or with the speed of progression to Alzheimer-type dementia. Among 297 patients seen in a Spanish neurology clinic with a diagnosis of MCI, only 2 genetic variants had an impact on the progression to Alzheimer-type dementia. As expected, the APOE ε4 allele more than quadrupled the risk of progression to Alzheimer-type dementia (P<.001). Carriers of the clusterin (CLU) T-allele had a lower risk of conversion to Alzheimer-type dementia than noncarriers of the T-allele. With respect to speed of progression, APOE was the only individual genetic predictor of a more rapid progression (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.05–2.97; P = .030). In addition, the investigators reported that carriers of at least 6 non-APOE genetic variants had a 2-fold increased risk of more rapid progression to Alzheimer-type dementia.Subtype of MCIThe National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association recently released recommendations for the stratification of MCI categories in the context of the likelihood of progression to Alzheimer-type dementia.55 Categorization into such groups is based on neuroimaging (such as atrophy of medial temporal lobe) and biomarkers (such as Tau proteins and Aβ1–42). Four categories are proposed: those with high likelihood to progress to Alzheimer-type dementia, intermediate likelihood, unlikely, and a core group with conflicting results (Table 2). Two studies validated these categories using different populations enrolled either in the ADNI study 76 or the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center or Mayo Clinic Study on Aging cohorts.77 Guo and colleagues 76 found a higher risk of progression to Alzheimer-type dementia when the high-risk group was compared with the core group (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4–3.9; P = .002). Jack and colleagues 77 used the criteria to classify preclinical disease (among those with normal cognition), to improve the understanding of the disease process and promote the optimal intervention point to minimize future disease progression. However, because categorical definitions for early disease processes and MCI subtypes has been recently released, the majority of categorization schemes have defined MCI subtypes as amnestic or nonamnestic and single-domain or multi-domain characteristics.A subtype of MCI was suggested to identify the possible neurologic abnormality to describe the progression to different dementias in a study of older adults with MCI cared for in a California Alzheimer disease center.13 After a mean follow-up time of 3 years, 65% progressed to any form of dementia; those with amnestic forms of MCI were more likely to progress to Alzheimer-type dementia, whereas nonamnestic forms were more likely to progress to vascular or frontotemporal dementia. Similarly, in a population of 60 Italian older adults followed for a mean of 4 years, any type of MCI increased the risk for any dementia (HR 3.02, 95% CI 1.86–4.89) as well as Alzheimer-type dementia (HR 3.21, 95% CI 1.77–5.81), but not vascular dementia. This risk appeared to be attributable to the risk of amnestic MCI in the progression to any dementia (see Table 1); and, interestingly, the risk of progression to any dementia was no different among those with nonamnestic MCI and those without MCI. However, it must be noted that the sample size with nonamnestic MCI was too small to draw conclusions.78 Zhou and colleagues 79 recently highlighted predictors of progression to dementia among the ADNI cohort with MCI by focusing on demographic, genetic, imaging, and cognitive assessments conducted at baseline. The investigators conducted Cox proportional hazard regression models to identify variables increasing the risk of progression to dementia, and further characterized these risks into survival trees. Stepwise Cox regression analysis determined the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale with 13 items (ADAS13) and logical memory with delayed recall as the 2 tests most frequently identifying abnormal results. Alzheimer-type dementia developed in the entire cohort at a rate of 5.6% at 12 months and 58.1% at 48 months. Considering a combination of baseline ADAS13 scores greater than 15.67 and Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes (CDR-sob) scores greater than 1.5 yielded an incident Alzheimer-type dementia rate of 12.9% at 12 months and 92.7% at 48 months. Using the ADAS13 as the first categorization method, the strength of this predictive risk stratification was similar when either baseline battery tests or imaging measures of cortical thickness of the right inferior temporal lobe were used, all with a similar c-index of 0.68. Although a promising lead, it must be restated that the population included in the ADNI cohort may have limited translation to populations cared for in many clinical settings.In an alternative and complementary approach, Koepsell and Monsell80 pursued this research question with the objective of identifying predictors of the reversion from MCI to normal cognitive function. The investigators used a cohort of approximately 3000 subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center who were at least 65 years old and diagnosed with MCI. After a follow-up period of approximately 1 year, 5 risk factors predicting reversion from MCI to normal cognition were identified: higher baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, lower CDR-sob scores, fewer functional impairments, nonamnestic single-domain subtype of MCI, and a lack of APOE ε4 genotype. Of note, these results did not incorporate clinical factors such as burden of vascular disease, and categorized normal cognition as either normal or “impaired but not MCI” as the outcome measure, stating that categorization across multiple centers used each term with variable frequencies. However, the investigators also identified a trend among those patients with MCI who reverted to normal cognitive function that suggests they were more likely to transition back to MCI or to dementia than those cognitively normal at baseline.80 Modifiable Risk Factors Comorbidity and Other Clinical Characteristics Chronic comorbid disease such as coronary heart disease and hypertension are common in older adults who develop cognitive impairment,81,82 often requiring the use of several medications to reach therapeutic goals. It has been documented that ambulatory older adults use an average of 11 medications per day and that 74% combine prescription medications and dietary supplements.83,84 Incident cognitive impairment has been suggested to be less likely in those using medications to control for vascular risk factors 85–89; however, other medications may result in adverse cognitive outcomes, such as MCI, and represent a potentially reversible risk factor.A descriptive analysis of a population with cognitive impairment (either MCI or dementia) from the Cache County study suggests that those with cognitive impairment have a more severe burden of comorbid disease than those without cognitive impairment.90 Vascular disease has been considered the most likely comorbidity to cause a more rapid progression of cognitive impairment. One study involving approximately 500 older adults from a Midwestern Alzheimer disease center evaluated risk factors for progression from MCI to dementia. Using a Markov chain model to assess the transition from one cognitive state to another, the investigators did not find an influence of demographic, genetic, or education on the progression to dementia, but rather found that a baseline history of hypertension reduced the likelihood of progression to dementia. This population was largely Caucasian and educated, possibly indicating a higher likelihood of adherence to medications to control hypertension and reduce the burden of vascular disease.Investigators from the Italian Longitudinal Study in Aging focused an analysis of their population-based database on the relationship of metabolic syndrome with the progression of MCI to dementia.91 Metabolic syndrome is recognized by the presence of at least 3 of the following features: abdominal obesity (measured by waist circumference), elevated plasma triglyceride levels of at least 150 mg/dL, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (<40 mg/dL for men and <50 mg/dL for women), high blood pressure (≥130/≥85 mm Hg), or use of antihypertensive treatment. The study observed approximately 2100 patients over a mean of 3.5 years, only 121 of whom had MCI. Multivariate models adjusting for several potential demographic and cardiovascular confounders revealed a higher risk of progression to any dementia among those with metabolic syndrome. Within this same population, interestingly no relationship between metabolic syndrome and incident MCI was identified.A prospective study of 257 Chinese older adults with MCI was conducted to identify risk factors for the progression of cognitive decline (evaluated by MMSE score), progression from MCI to any dementia, and progression from MCI to Alzheimer-type dementia.92 The investigators considered vascular risk factors of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco and alcohol use over a 3-year observation period. MRI and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) were used to identify changes in white matter and degree of cerebral arteriostenosis. Considering all clinical variables and imaging results, diabetes, baseline severity of white matter change, and carotid stenosis were robust predictors for each outcome, including any dementia and Alzheimer-type dementia. The investigators evaluated the impact of antihypertensive use and oral hypoglycemic or insulin use, and found no association with the progression to dementia.92 Such results suggest that vascular risk factors resulting in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion have a negative impact on cognitive function and may advance the progression to any form of dementia.A similar study conducted in an Italian population of community-dwelling older adults with a diagnosis of MCI followed 245 subjects over approximately 2.5 years to evaluate the impact of vascular diseases on the progression of MCI to dementia.93 Vascular diseases were recognized by the Hachinski Ischemic Score and the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile. The Hachinksi score is a marker of existing cerebrovascular disease, whereas the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile is a marker of future cerebrovascular disease risk. The investigators also considered the presence of APOE ε4, smoking status, and the presence of WML as covariates in the analysis. The results suggest that among the 52% of subjects who progressed to dementia during the observation period, no individual clinical factor or vascular summary score was associated with an increased risk of progression to dementia. However, the combination of Hachinski scores greater than 4 with presence of WML near the basal ganglia increased the risk of progression to any form of dementia as well as to Alzheimer-type dementia (HR 3.8, 95% CI 1.2–11.5) after adjusting for age, sex, education, cumulative illness, MMSE, MCI subtype, and APOE genotype. Framingham Stroke Risk Profile was not associated with an increased risk of progression to dementia, either alone or in combination with imaging results. Other notable studies have evaluated the role of vascular risk factors on the development of dementia, with conflicting results. Results from some observational studies have produced similar results that show no association between individual risk of cardiovascular disease and incident dementia,13,94–96 whereas others have suggested vascular risk factors may independently increase the risk of progression to dementia.97–99 In 2004 DeCarli and colleagues 95 reported from a cohort of older adults with MCI and calculated vascular risk through a composite score as the sum of vascular risk factors (up to 6). The investigators also defined Alzheimer-type dementia as a progression from a CDR-sob score of 0.5 to 1.0 or greater. Although limitations in the population as well as the methods are noted, no association between baseline vascular risk factors and progression to Alzheimer-type dementia was identified.A Swedish longitudinal study on aging reported on the impact of diabetes and pre-diabetes on the progression from MCI to dementia. Approximately 300 subjects with MCI at baseline were followed for a mean of 3 years. After controlling for age, sex, education, body mass index, genotype, and vascular disorders, the risk of progression to any dementia (see Table 1) and Alzheimer-type dementia was increased by a diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes (HR 4.22, 95% CI 1.57–9.01). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis suggested that diabetes accelerated the time to progression to dementia by an average of 3.2 years. Of note, no risk of incident MCI was identified in older adults with diabetes and normal cognition at baseline.98A recent observational study conducted in a Chinese population over 5 years suggests that vascular risk factors increase the progression of MCI to Alzheimer-type dementia.99 The investigators report that vascular risk factors (including hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and hypercholesterolemia) additively increase the risk of progression to Alzheimer-type dementia, and that treatment of vascular disease was associated with a reduction in the risk of conversion to dementia. Although medication adherence and clinical treatment targets were not assessed, this study gives strong support to interventions aimed at managing vascular risk factors in those with MCI as a method to reduce the progression to dementia. Further support for the treatment of vascular disease in reducing the neuropathology of Alzheimer-type dementia was published in 2009 by Hoffman and colleagues, who used autopsy evidence to show fewer neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in those with hypertension who received antihypertensive medication than in those not receiving antihypertensive medication.22 Contrasting such results, a secondary analysis of the Ginkgo Evaluation in Memory Study described the role of statins on the progression from MCI to dementia in this observational study.100 Among those with a baseline diagnosis of MCI, statins were found to have no influence on the progression from MCI to all-cause or Alzheimer-type dementia, although statins were shown to reduce incident dementia in the cohort that was cognitively normal at baseline (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65–0.96). Though a promising result for incident dementia, this analysis was conducted with self-reported measures of medication exposure, suggesting this association requires further study with more accurate measures of medication exposure as well as control of disease state. Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in up to 30% of older adults with a diagnosis of MCI.101 Because neuropsychiatric symptoms have been associated with a worse prognosis in dementia,102 the relationship between neuropsychiatric symptoms and the risk for progression of MCI to dementia was assessed in a population enrolled from Cache County, Utah.103 A cohort of 230 older adults diagnosed with MCI was evaluated for predictors of progression to any dementia using a cognitive and neuropsychiatric battery (MMSE, Modified MMSE, CDR, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI]). In multivariate regression models controlling for age, education, and APOE status, nighttime behaviors predicted progression to all-cause dementia (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.08–1.52) and hallucinations predicted progression only to vascular dementia, not all-cause or Alzheimer-type dementia (HR 10.1, 95% CI 1.1–91.1). Overall scores on the NPI suggest that even a minor severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms increases the risk of progression to any dementia (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.01–2.69). Despite the relatively small sample size, this study suggests that further attention to and possibly specific interventions targeting those with neuropsychiatric symptoms may reduce the progression of MCI to dementia.Other psychiatric symptoms have been evaluated as potential risk factors for the progression of MCI to dementia. Prior work has identified depression and anxiety as 2 risk factors increasing such progression.104–106 Two of these studies present conflicting results on the role of depression in the progression of MCI. Whereas both studies assessed depression and anxiety with an outcome of Alzheimer-type dementia in populations with amnestic or multi domain MCI, Palmer and colleagues 106 suggest that depression alone does not increase the risk of progression to dementia except in those with normal cognition, whereas Modrego and Ferrandez 105 report that the risk of progression is nearly 2-fold in those with depressive symptoms. The 2 studies used different tools to identify depression symptoms, with Modrego using the Geriatric Depression Scale and Palmer identifying symptoms through the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale.105,106 Controversially, the recent study by Peters and colleagues 103 described earlier does not suggest that either depression or anxiety, assessed as domains in the NPI, influenced the progression of MCI to dementia. It must be borne in mind that depression and anxiety assessments in the NPI are single-item responses, in comparison with other screening tools assessing 15 to 30 items. However, when Peters and colleagues 103 grouped mood-related domains of depression, anxiety, apathy, and irritability together, no impact on disease progression was revealed. Of note, a recent study by Richard and colleagues 104 found that apathy, but not depressive symptoms, increased the risk of progression from MCI to Alzheimer-type dementia.The combination of consistent antidepressant treatment (flexible regimen) with or without donepezil in older adults with major depression was recently evaluated. In the cohort with MCI at baseline, adding donepezil to the antidepressant regimen reduced the likelihood of progression to dementia over the 2-year study period; however, this group was also more likely to experience a recurrence of major depression (44% vs 12%, likelihood ratio 4.91; P = .03).107 The investigators appropriately concluded that the potential benefits of adjuvant donepezil and antidepressant therapy require further study, and strong consideration of the risks in the face of the potential benefits. Future Considerations Risk stratification based on factors identified in observational studies may offer an opportunity to focus interventions on reducing the risk of incident dementia in those patients at highest risk. As described earlier,79 existing databases of cohorts with MCI have been used to predict the transition to dementia. Fig. 1 summarizes the risk factors previously identified to modify the progression from MCI to normal cognition, mixed or vascular dementia, or Alzheimer-type dementia. As a starting point, these results represent promising methods of identifying those populations at highest risk; however, the limitations of such cohorts from the existing literature, often composed of participants involved in research activity, may not represent the population encountered in many clinical environments and reduces the clinical applicability of such results. Similarly, no study has yet focused on interventions such as control of cardiovascular risk factors specifically in those with MCI, making risk-stratification methods applicable to only research environments. To date, studies evaluating the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, NSAIDs, and ginkgo biloba have not yielded results promoting their routine use in clinical practice among those with MCI.Further evidence is necessary to clarify the impact of comorbid disease, specifically related to the level of disease control, on the progression of MCI to dementia. As noted earlier, there has recently been a significant amount of activity toward understanding the role of comorbid disease on the progression of cognitive impairment. Findings that the treatment of comorbid vascular disease may reduce the likelihood of progression to dementia are promising 22,99; however, no consideration of the intensity of treatment such as target blood pressure or hemoglobin A1c has been considered. Considering the complexity of medication management and adherence in this population, especially among those experiencing difficulty in executive function, this issue of disease-state control should be pursued with careful attention to risks and benefits of medications. Appropriate methods for assessing medication adherence and monitoring plans that frequently address potential adverse events should be established by clinicians in attempting to control multiple comorbidities in this frail older adult population.Lastly, although associations between modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, have been suggested, little evidence in the identification of potentially relevant, nonvascular disease states has been pursued, such as oxygen deprivation states of asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and severe heart failure. Similarly, certain medications thought to temporarily or permanently impair cognitive function, including anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and possibly statins, are poorly represented in the existing literature.Summary Several risk factors for the progression of cognitive impairment in those diagnosed with MCI have been considered. The variability in results found in the existing literature arises in part from the heterogeneity in populations studied, subtypes of MCI considered, and dementia outcomes evaluated as study end points. Risk factors identified to increase the risk of Alzheimer disease pathology include the presence of deep WML combined with Hachinski Ischemic Scores greater than 4, the presence of APOE ε4 and absence of CLU genotypes, presence of more than 6 genetic markers for Alzheimer-type dementia, amnestic subtype of MCI, psychiatric symptoms of anxiety, depression, or apathy, and presence of diabetes or prediabetes. Risk factors increasing the risk of mixed or vascular dementias include carotid stenosis, diabetes (or prediabetes), depression, low blood pressure, and atrial fibrillation.From a researcher's perspective, this information is of value as it may improve population selection, design of the intervention, and definition of the outcomes of interest in the quest to minimize the progression of MCI to dementia. Clinicians, patients, and the health care system value this information because it permits a more informed conversation about disease prevention, clinical treatment, and advanced care planning. The risk factors identified thus far represent modifiable and nonmodifiable variables to be incorporated into both research and clinical practice as possible targets for prevention and treatment of progressive cognitive impairment. Given the recognition of common comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes as potentially modifiable risk factors, future management of prevention strategies for the progression of MCI to dementia is likely to fall into the hands of primary care and general practice physicians and mid-level providers.Acknowledgments Funding Support: This work was supported by grant R01 HS019818-01 from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Mild Cognitive Impairment in Geriatrics,"Eric  G.  Tangalos,MD,  Ronald  C.  Petersen,MD,  PhD",KEYWORDS MCI Mild cognitive impairment Biomarkers in Alzheimer disease Cognition Functional impairment,"KEY POINTS Mild cognitive impairment is an intermediate state between normal cognition and dementia. It is an important construct in understanding cognitive decline. Mild cognitive impairment is the most predominant form and is the best predictor of future dementia, including Alzheimer disease. Mild cognitive impairment has predictive value for conversion to Alzheimer disease. Bio-markers may have value in determining disease-modifying therapy. The genetics of Alzheimer disease apply to rates of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease. This link will benefit future tailored therapies. In long-term care settings the condition is common and it is particularly problematic in assisted living if a resident’s cognitive capacity is not correctly identified. INTRODUCTION The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as an intermediate state between normal cognition and dementia entered into the vernacular of geriatric medicine more than 30 years ago. Geriatric fellowship programs teach to the condition and primary care providers all have a passing understand that somewhere between normal and dementia there resides a population that fits the definition. In long-term care settings, the condition is common and it is particularly problematic in assisted living if a resident’s cognitive capacity is not correctly identified. Incorrect placement or movement to a higher level of care for additional services shortly after a move in destabilizes the resident and family all the more at a most critical time of transition.MCI as a term was introduced into the literature in 1988 by Reisberg and colleagues,1but referred to a severity index of stage 3 as identified on the Global Deterioration Scale. Another instrument, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sought to identify very early dementia given the possibility of identifying disease early and intervening as soon as possible.2By 1999, MCI had been proposed as a prodromal condition for Alzheimer disease with the focus on memory as a chief clinical complaint for incipient disease.3 Not all forms of MCI evolve into Alzheimer disease.Although a misclassification may be a disservice to the diagnosis of MCI, the great disservice is to the patient. Geriatricians need to use the diagnosis appropriately for patient care, understand the treatment limitations, apply appropriate management strategies, and prepare for a biomarker approach to diagnosis that makes MCI a valuable construct at looking at the spectrum of Alzheimer disease.A COMMON UNDERSTANDING MCI refers to cognitive impairment that does not meet the criteria for dementia.Several criteria for, and subtypes of, MCI have been proposed.4–6 For our purposes,there must be a measurable deficit in cognition in at least 1 domain, there cannot be a dementia diagnosis, and the individual should have no functional impairment in their activities of daily living.MCI has a number of different clinical presentations and etiologies, although the prognosis and prevalence 6–8 varies depending on the starting point of decline. The Usefulness of the diagnosis now allows extending the early detection of other dementias in their prodromal stages.9–11 Current criteria were developed to encompass the cognitive domains most commonly affected in the disorders (eg, memory problems and Alzheimer disease).11,12MCI fits between the cognitive changes of aging and the impact of dementia.Considerable judgment is required in making the distinction between impairments that are normal for the elderly population and, at the other extreme, do not represent dementia. What constitutes impairment in daily living is always contextual. Patients With spouses, good financial resources, or attentive families do better. They display fewer functional difficulties because of their socio economic environment. The astute geriatrician is well aware that changes in the living environment have great impact on revealing significant limitations. Subjective cognitive complaints and even activities of daily living have been challenged as criteria in establishing the diagnosis.3,13,14 Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment Amnestic MCI (aMCI) is often thought of as a precursor to Alzheimer disease.15 a MCI is the most common subtype, with a ratio of 2:1 compared with non-aMCI (naMCI),although relative prevalence of MCI subtypes has varied among studies.16,17 Initially, MCI was used to refer to the amnestic subtype, but other subtypes have since been recognized (see Nonamnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment). Single domain aMCI refers to those individuals with significantly impaired memory who do not meet the criteria for dementia. The criteria originally outlined forMCI are understood to identify specifically this type 4,9: Memory complaint, preferably corroborated by an informant; Objective memory impairment (for age and education); Preserved general cognitive function; Intact activities of daily living; and Not demented.Memory impairments that qualify for MCI are generally represented by defects that are 1.5 standard deviations or more below age-corrected norms. This threshold is not absolute, however, because individuals can experience a significant loss of memory without satisfying that criterion. Different tests of memory likely have different sensitivity and specificity and norms are not available for all populations; this lack further justifies the necessity of clinical judgment.7 Multiple Domains Many individuals with aMCI complain only of memory loss; however, they may have additional subtle impairments in other cognitive domains that are revealed with careful neuropsychological testing.10,18–20Such persons may also manifest subtle problems with activities of daily living, but do not meet the criteria for a formal diagnosis of dementia.8The multiple domains are, by definition, only slightly impaired (ie, <0.5–1.0standard deviations below age- and education-matched normal participants). These Individuals often progress to meet criteria for Alzheimer disease dementia; in a minor-ity of cases, the cognitive profile may simply reflect normal aging.8The prognostic usefulness of the multiple domain form of aMCI remains unclear, because some studies have identified this as the highest risk category for conversion to dementia,whereas others have exposed instability with some individuals returning to baseline level of function over time.10,21,22Much of this variability derives from different sources of subjects, for example, specialty clinics versus population cohorts.Nonamnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment Single domain The concept of single domain naMCI is similar to aMCI, except that this form of MCI is characterized by a relatively isolated impairment in a single non memory domain, such as executive functioning, language, or visual spatial skills.Depending on the domain,individuals with this subtype of MCI may progress to other syndromes, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), primary progressive aphasia, dementia with Lewy bodies,progressive supranuclear palsy, or corticobasal degeneration. Individuals within this group seem to be at less of a risk of conversion to dementia, although supporting evidence is limited.12,23In certain disorders such as behavioral variant FTD, cognitive complaints are often preceded by significant alterations in behavior and comportment. Thus, some investigators have proposed the concept of mild behavioral impairment as a similar paradigm to recognize an additional group with increased risk of dementia.24 Multiple domains Patients who meet these criteria are affected in multiple domains with a relative sparing of memory problems. The substrate of multidomain naMCI is felt to be that of degenerative disorders associated with tau, TAR DNA binding protein and alpha-synuclein such as FTD and dementia with Lewy bodies.2,25 Other studies have linked MCI in multiple domains to other types of dementia.26 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition has included mild neurocognitive disorder since 2013.27Age-associated memory impairment and age-associated cognitive decline are also widely used terms but represent normal age-associated memory and cognitive changes in older adults as referenced to young normal adult individuals.4,28,29Age-associated cognitive decline was developed to betterdefine the cognitive changes in elderly patients compared with age-adjusted norms, buthas more recently been recognized as identifying a state of impairment similar to MCI.30 MAKING THE CASE Cognitive impairment is prevalent in American nursing homes and assisted living facilities; 70% or more of residents have some type of cognitive impairment.31–34In both ","settings, studies estimate that approximately 50% to 60% of all residents meet criteria for dementia 35–38 and approximately 20% to 25% of residents meet criteria for MCI.33 The concept is now accepted for clinical care 39,40 and has been adopted in Europe.The ability to identify residents in long-term care settings with cognitive impairment is critical to effective care plans and interventions and can facilitate appropriate staff interactions so important to residents’ quality of life.41 There is ample evidence that,when cognitive impairment is not identified accurately, the management of medical conditions can be adversely affected.42,43 An International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics–Global Aging Research Network consensus conference in St. Louis in early 2015 identified that cognitive impairment creates significant challenges for patients, their families and friends, and the clinicians who provide their health care. Early recognition allows for diagnosis and appropriate treatment, education, psychosocial support, and engagement in shared decision making regarding life planning, health care, involvement in research,and financial matters. The consensus panel examined the importance of early recognition of impaired cognitive health. Their major conclusion was that case finding by physicians and health professionals is an important step toward enhancing brain health for aging populations throughout the world. This conclusion is in keeping with the position of the United States’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,which reimburses for the detection of cognitive impairment as part the of Medicare Annual Wellness Visit and with the international call for early detection of cognitive impairment as a patient’s right. The panel agreed on the following specific findings:1. Validated screening tests are available that take 3 to 7 minutes to administer;2. A combination of patient- and informant-based screens is the most appropriate approach for identifying early cognitive impairment;3. Early cognitive impairment may have treatable components; and4. Emerging data support a combination of medical and lifestyle interventions as a potential way to delay or reduce cognitive decline.44 TOOLS OF THE TRADE Currently, the Brief Interview for Mental Status 45 is the mandated cognitive assessment tool included in the Minimum Data Set 3.0 for skilled care nursing home residents. The Brief Interview for Mental Status is an efficient measure that has strong reliability and convergent validity, can be rapidly administered (average time is about 3 minutes), and is suitable for paraprofessional use.46The Brief Interview for Mental Status was never intended to be sensitive to the full cognitive continuum and does not stage dementia levels. The cut scores differentiating residents with and without cognitive impairments are based, in part, on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination,47a measure that seems to have poor sensitivity to MCI.48 Cut scores were not based on broader and potentially more powerful assessments, such as a neuropsychological battery, imaging analyses, or biomarkers. Consequently, reported test scores may be inaccurate. Memory is assessed using a simple word list (3 words),with no story recall component, and executive function is only addressed mini-mally.33,49The Brief Cognitive Assessment Tool has been proposed to address these shortcomings. The Brief Cognitive Assessment Tool is a 21-item instrument that can be administered in approximately 10 to 15 minutes by paraprofessionals and clinicians, contains a strong multilevel verbal memory component (inclusive of story recall items), and has a broadly complex executive function component. Another purported advantage of the Brief Cognitive Assessment Tool is that it has been shown to specifically differentiate between MCI and dementia.31 Geriatricians also have available to them a wide assortment of additional cognitive screens, including the informant-based AD8.50–54Each can have its place in a busy primary care practice to screen at-risk populations of patients, especially those who find themselves transitioning into some higher level of service with less independence.Assisted living and nursing homes come quickly to mind. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which was published in 197523and the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status 55 are now mostly relegated to research/drug protocols that rely on these baseline measures. All are validated, some have been translated into many languages (theAD8 is available in >100 languages), and each carries with it enough sensitivity and specificity when used in populations at risk to provide good stratification from normal to abnormal once the age and education is taken into account.The Gerontological Society of America also looked at brief instruments that were non proprietary. Their comprehensive toolkit is focused on the KAER model developed by the GSA Workgroup on Cognitive Impairment Detection and Earlier Diagnosis.56The workgroup identified valuable tools and resources to implement the 4 steps in the KAER model. The resulting toolkit provides options for each of the steps so thatprimary care providers, health plans and health care systems can select the ap-proaches and tools that fit best with their existing primary care structure, organization,and procedures.The toolkit is broken down by each section of theKAERmodel to allow quick andeasy access:Kickstartthe cognition conversation,Assessfor cognitive impairment,Evaluatefor dementia, andReferfor community resources.THE AGING PATIENTAlthough specific changes in cognition are frequently observed in normal aging, thereis increasing evidence that some forms of cognitive impairment are recognizable as anearly manifestation of dementia.3MCI is a heterogeneous syndrome and there re-mains controversy over aspects of the construct. However, the usefulness of thisparadigm is the recognition that dementia is not a dichotomous state and thus refiningour understanding of the layers of transition will improve the understanding of cogni-tive decline and ultimately benefit patients. Appropriate diagnosis lets us address ourpatient needs with the best available therapies, be they drug or nondrug interventions.Unfortunately, all too often MCI is used to soften a diagnosis of what should really bedementia. In 2003, Winblad and colleagues57sought to expand and revise thecriteria.58From that conference the criteria now used by the National Institute onAging-sponsored Alzheimer Disease Centers Program Uniform Data Set and the Alz-heimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative59have helped us design protocols to improveour understanding of the dementing process. The clinical phenotypes as we have nowdiscussed include aMCI and naMCI with the subtypes of single and multiple domainclassifications.In general, our shortcomings in approaching patients with cognitive decline havebeen to avoid a diagnosis and delay our interventions. The reasons are multiple,although taking the time to make a diagnosis means that much more time will be needed to explain the diagnosis and take action. Any assault on our independence with special concern regarding the loss of driving privileges plays poorly to the American mindset. We live in a land where our first right of passage is the driver’s license and where all roads lead to the shopping mall. We do not live in walking communities and the last thing we give up is our driver’s license. There have also been financial disincentives in the past when clinicians used a psychiatric code to define cognitive dis-ease though MCI and the dementing syndromes now can be classified with International Classification of Diseases-10 medical codes.MCI has been studied more extensively in ambulatory patients, but both nursing homes and assisted living facilities have a high reported prevalence of cognitive impairment.36,37 Questions remain regarding whether MCI subtypes found in community-dwelling patients are mirrored in long-term care settings and how selected impairment thresholds might impact probable diagnosis. The work by Mansbach and associates 60 identified 3 clear MCI subtypes in the long term care setting: amnestic,single domain; nonamnestic, single domain (executive); and amnestic, multidomain(memory and executive). A fourth category (undifferentiated) was identified in patients who did not meet the criteria for a distinct MCI subtype, but still had cognitive impairments.Given the difficulty in identifying state by state assisted living facilities (conservative estimate of 1 million) as compared with skilled care (1.4 million, 2014 National Center for Health Statistics), the long-term care population should command the interest and respect of geriatricians. Generally, the only separation of these 2 populations is their functional impairment. Attempts have been made in assisted living to test the performance of various instruments given the high prevalence of disease. In a North Carolina sample of assisted living residents, 55 of 146 participants (38%) were diagnosed with probable dementia and 76 (52%) met criteria for MCI (most nonamnestic). Both the Mini-Cog and the MMSE showed high sensitivity and negative predictive value for dementia, but had relatively low sensitivity and negative predictive value for MCI. The Mini-Cog had low specificity and was less accurate as a dementia screen than either the MMSE or MMX. Reliability and validity data for testing the MMX, a 50-point test based on expanding selected MMSE items, were satisfactory and it performed better as a screening test for MCI than either the MMSE or Mini-Cog.61 Additional studies have also indicated that amnestic and executive deficits are particularly common in long-term care patients,36,62 whereas amnestic and executive subtypes have been identified in community samples of the elderly.63 FRAILTY AS A CONFOUNDER Geriatricians may be confronted by those who are extremely old (90 in a male, 95 in a female) where sudden near complete failure includes a rapidly progressing dementia.It is unlikely that this is Alzheimer disease alone and there is rarely a classic presentation of MCI as prodromal. Cognitive frailty is a term that has recently emerged in the geriatrics literature, inspired by potential parallel links to and possible common underlying mechanisms with the physical frailty syndrome.Physical frailty has been defined as “a medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that is, characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual’s vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.”64 Recently, it has been recognized that a sub-group of persons with cognitive impairment have a decreased resilience and functional decline that interacts with physical frailty. Converging evidence suggests that the cognitive status represents an important dimension of the frailty syndrome.Epidemiologic studies have shown an association between frailty and late-life cognitive decline, incident MCI and Alzheimer disease, and non-Alzheimer disease dementia.65 It has been suggested that cognitive frailty can be defined as a reduced cognitive function (Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5) with the cognitive impairment being due to either physical or brain disease 2,66 or accelerated brain aging in the absence of evident brain disease. Physical frailty has to coexist to evoke the term cognitive frailty. It manifests commonly with executive dysfunction (frontal cortex)and less with pure amnestic defects (mesial temporal cortex). Others have suggested that the deficits in frail and prefrail patients in executive function and memory may be similar in size.67 There is some evidence that, even with normal aging, both cognitive decline and physical frailty often coexist.68–70 Cross-sectional studies find a high level of coexistence between rates of cognitive impairment and dementia and physical frailty.71 Frailty predicts cognitive decline and incident dementia 72,73 and cognitive impairment predicts frailty 74,75in longitudinal studies. Loss of executive function and poor atten-tion are particularly associated with slow gait.76There is increasing evidence that per-sons with white matter hyperintensities have poor balance, poor get up and goperformance, slow gait speed, and increased falls.77–79White matter hyperintensitiesalso predict functional decline.80In a Spanish study, fall risk factors did not hold adirect correlation with the level of cognitive impairment among elderly nursing homecare residents.81HOME-BASED AND COMMUNITY-BASED CAREThe vast majority—80%—of elderly people receiving assistance, including manywith several functional limitations, live in private homes in the community and notin institutions.82Elderly people with limitations in 3 or more activities of daily living who live in thecommunity receive an average of 9 hours of assistance per day (counting bothformal and informal sources of care) and people age 85 or older with that degreeof impairment typically receive about 11 hours of assistance per day.83The trend toward community-based services as opposed to nursing home place-ment was formalized with the Olmstead Decision (July, 1999), a court case inwhich the Supreme Court upheld the right of individuals to receive care in thecommunity as opposed to an institution whenever possible.The proportion of Americans aged 65 and over with disabilities who rely entirelyon formal care for their personal assistance needs has increased to 9% in 1999from 5% in 1984.Between 2000 and 2002, the number of licensed assisted living and board andcare facilities increased from 32,886 to 36,399 nationally, reflecting the trend to-ward community-based care as opposed to nursing homes.84Most assistedliving facilities, however, are unlicensed.Most assisted living facilities discharge residents whose cognitive impairmentsbecome moderate or severe or who need help with transfers (eg, moving froma wheelchair to a bed). This factor limits the ability of these populations to find appropriate services outside of nursing homes or other institutions.85 WHY DOES IT MATTER?If we wait for functional decline to define dementia, it may be too late to treat the underlying disease process.4 Moreover, because functional decline is in the definition of dementia, it is best to work with a construct that would allow intervention sooner rather than later. With this theoretic framework, many studies have been conducted to investigate the usefulness and prognostic outcome of the diagnoses.4In addition, the concept of MCI plays extremely well as we design hypothesis-driven research, be it with regard to clinical markers, psychological assessment, neuroimaging, biomarkers, or drug and nondrug interventions.13This point is perhaps equally as important as the clinical diagnosis and has generated research opportunities worldwide. Theconstruct of MCI has been incorporated into research on aging from multiple perspectives including clinical research, epidemiology, neuroimaging, mechanisms of disease,clinical trials, and caregiving.13 Numerous investigations worldwide have used these criteria as an infrastructure for estimating the frequency of MCI and its subtypes.5–8 Both prospective 5,9 and retrospective studies 10 have helped to define the subtleties of the diagnosis. A major factor in determining outcome depends on the source of the patient being studied. The Closer one is to a community sample, the lower the annual rates of progression(6%–10%).11 With referral-based studies, such as those that come from sampling a memory disorders clinic or Alzheimer disease center, the progression rates increases to 10% to 15% per year, particularly for Alzheimer disease.12 These differences reflect the probability of having an underlying disorder such as MCI when a participant or concerned family member seeks treatment at a referral clinic. The same phenomenon occurs at dementia screening clinics that advertise their services and claim diagnostic rates approaching 50%. This finding is in the face of baseline incidence rates of dementia and Alzheimer disease of 1% to 2% per year.3 EPIDEMIOLOGY The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging was designed as a population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, involving a random sample of nearly 3000 participants aged 70 through 89 years who were nondemented and cognitively normal or who had MCIat entry.14The prevalence of MCI from this study is estimated at approximately 15% of the nondemented population, with a 2:1 ratio of aMCI to naMCI. The most common putative cause is degenerative 86 and this cause predominates to a greater extent for aMCI than for naMCI. There is also strong evidence that these rates tend to hold up throughout the world at about 14% to 18% for individuals aged 70 and older.13In early 2018, the American Academy of Neurology published its “Practice Guideline Update: Mild Cognitive Impairment.”86 The guideline focuses on the prevalence and treatment of MCI and finds that there is strong evidence that MCI prevalence is high in the general population, with prevalence increasing for every 4-year age group start-ing at the age of 60 years. Overall, in persons 65 and older, the pooled prevalence of MCI is about 15% to 20%, and that compares with a population prevalence of dementia of about 10% to 12%. Furthermore, strong evidence shows that the natural history for many MCI cases can progress to dementia so a thorough evaluation to determine the underlying cause is important because some causes are treatable (Figs. 1and2).ASSESSING THE PATIENT Patients with MCI, particularly the amnestic subtype, complain primarily of impaired memory, or at least their families make the case that there is a new problem. It is also likely that the changes have been progressive over time, subtle but taken as a whole a change from a former level of function. Subjective memory complaints have been demonstrated to predict cognitive decline, even when patients seems to be un-impaired on testing.87–91 The 1 free pass, such as recalling names, is frequently reported by normal elderly patients. The patient that arrives worried and reports memory complaints can be found to have impaired concentration with a mood or affective disorder.87,92 Some individuals who meet neuropsychological test criteria for MCI deny having any significant memory problems.93 In contrast with the impaired awareness of deficits commonly present in patients with Alzheimer disease, younger patients with MCI are often troubled by their symptoms.89,94,95 However, as the patient ages and develops more overt disease, including Alzheimer disease, informant-reported symptoms over self-reported symptoms predominate.96As with dementia, mood and behavioral symptoms are more common in patients with MCI than in cognitively unimpaired, age-matched controls.97–102 The Prevalence of depression ranges from 25% to 40%103; other common symptoms include irritability, anxiety, aggression, and apathy.99 Patients with MCI and behavioral symptoms may be more impaired on cognitive measures than those without behavioral symptoms.99 Population-based studies comparing MCI and patients with Alzheimer disease find a similar range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, with patients with Alzheimer disease having them in somewhat higher frequency and severity.100,104,105 The end stage for nursing home patients is often the overt manifestation of behavioral symptoms, although this population continues to receive antidepressant therapy and treatment with atypical antipsychotics, although in lesser numbers and amounts than a decade ago.Cognitive impairment may be a presenting symptom of depression, so-called pseudodementia. Depression may also be an early manifestation of cognitive impairment.A number of population-based studies have found an association between variousmeasure of depression and the presence of MCI.97,106,107However, follow-up datahave yielded somewhat mixed results: Among 500 persons who were 85 years old, impaired cognition at baseline wasassociated with increasing depressive symptoms over 4 years of follow-up, butbaseline depression was not associated with accelerated cognitive decline.106In contrast, other large cohort studies have found that depressed mood and/oranxiety are associated with increased risk of MCI in patients with normal cogni-tion, and with progression to dementia in patients with MCI.97,107–110Finally, an analysis of MCI diagnostic criteria used in 6 clinical trials found thatexcluding patients with depression significantly decreased the sensitivity ratesof MCI diagnosis for a future diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.111ESTABLISHING THE DIAGNOSISA work group on diagnostic guidelines from the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’sAssociation identified the following core clinical features that indicate MCI owing to Alz-heimer disease.112These criteria only refer to the majority of MCI that is likely to prog-ress to Alzheimer disease and not to MCI owing to other etiologies, for example,vascular disease, other neurodegenerative conditions, or psychiatric conditions.58Cognitive concern reflecting a change in cognition reported by patient or infor-mant or observed by clinician;Objective evidence of impairment in 1 or more cognitive domains, typicallyincluding memory;Preservation of independence in functional abilities; andNot demented.In addition, the etiology of MCI should be evaluated to identify the cause as mostlikely to be Alzheimer disease:Rule out vascular, traumatic, and medical causes of cognitive decline, wherepossible;Provide evidence of longitudinal decline in cognition, when feasible; andReport history consistent with Alzheimer disease genetic factors, where relevant.As part of the MCI owing to Alzheimer disease criteria, biomarkers are used toaugment clinical suspicions that the clinical syndrome of MCI is due to Alzheimer dis-ease.112The geriatrician needs to be familiar with the concept of biomarkers. Futuretherapies will depend on the construct of prodromal MCI, MCI, and early Alzheimerdisease and the vast array of testing now becoming available to segment the popula-tion for disease-modifying therapies based on genotype, amyloid or tau imaging onPET, and even cerebrospinal fluid evaluation.One of the first biomarkers for MCI and Alzheimer disease was apolipoprotein E(APOE) genotypes. Generally, the E4 phenotype conveys a higher likelihood of dis-ease, whereas the E2 genotype is somewhat protective.113The APOE e4 allele re-mains as an important predictor in MCI conversion to Alzheimer disease for patientswith single domain MCI and multiple domains MCI from onset to disease progression.Among those with MCI, e4 carriers had the lowest level of plasma APOE as well(Fig. 3).114The geriatrician must evaluate the patient for the potential of other conditions thatcan present with MCI:Depression or other disorders of mood that may present with cognitivecomplaints.Medications including anticholinergics, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, andthe nonbenzodiazepine Z-class of sedative hypnotics.115,116 Vitamin B12deficiency and hypothyroidism are always looked for and seldomfound.Alcohol use and abuse and, as the boomers age, other recreational drug useas well.In a community sample, patients with ""cognitive impairment, no dementia"" werediagnosed with depression and other psychiatric disease (10.2%), alcohol- anddrug-related causes (6.9%), and delirium (1%).117Approximately one-quarter of pa-tients had neurologic disease (brain tumor, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, ce-rebrovascular disease, and epilepsy). Among the remaining 57.5% of patients, most(31.7%) had circumscribed memory impairment.The story of beta amyloid is also intricately locked with our understanding of Alzheimer disease and, likewise, MCI. The role of beta amyloid in neurodegeneration has been thought to be seminal to the progression of disease. Unfortunately, all targeted therapies to date to clear beta amyloid, prevent its aggregation, or limit its impact on cellular function have not resulted in new drug interventions. Nonetheless,as a biomarker it clearly reflects disease progression (Fig. 4).118 APPROACHING THE PATIENT AND THEIR CAREGIVERS The clinical history remains the mainstay in making a diagnosis of MCI. It is all about what insight the patient maintains in understanding their memory deficit. However,obtaining a history from both the patient and an informant may provide further support that a cognitive decline does exist.21 Questions about cognition should address all major domains, including memory, attention–executive functioning, visuospatial skills,and language. Common memory symptoms include the tendency to repeat oneself or forgetfulness for recent events.Patients with attention–executive functioning impairment may have problems in making decisions, planning activities, and multitasking. Visuospatial difficulties may be elicited by asking about a tendency to get lost while driving or an inability track the lines on a page while reading. Word finding difficulty, paraphasias, and/or anomia may indi-cate language dysfunction. The history taking should also focus on functional status,including the ability to drive,manage finances,and maintain basic activities of daily living.Possible neuropsychiatric, motor, and sleep issues should be addressed, because the presence of these symptoms may suggest a possible etiology of an MCI subtype.Language difficulties, disinhibition, or socially inappropriate behavior may be seen in those with FTD; REM sleep behavior disorder, characterized by a tendency to act out dreams, has been associated with dementia with Lewy bodies. A past medical history may reveal cerebrovascular disease, seizures, head trauma, or systemic cancer or infections that may be contributing to the cognitive impairment.The time course of symptoms is also important. A gradual, insidious progression of symptoms may suggest a degenerative cause, whereas a more acute onset may indicate a vascular, inflammatory, or infectious etiology. The loss of concentration may bea presenting symptom, but it is more often associated with depression than with cognitive impairment. Good screening tests for depression are readily available and the Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 has found its way into many office practices.22 The PHQ-9 is the 9-item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire.It is a powerful tool for assisting primary care clinicians in diagnosing depression as well as selecting and monitoring treatment.The primary care clinician and/or office staff should discuss with the patient the reasons for completing the questionnaire and how to fill it out. It can be done by intact patients or used as a survey instrument and done by just about anyone. After the patient has completed the PHQ-9 questionnaire, it is simply scored. There are 2 components of the PHQ-9: (1) assessing symptoms and functional impairment to make a tentative depression diagnosis, and (2) deriving a severity score to help select and monitor treatment. It also responds to treatment initiatives with clinically validated changes in the patient’s response.After a history has been obtained that will also evaluate the impact of decline, a general neurologic examination should be performed. Any practitioner with appropriate experience can do the examination. Although the examination may be normal, abnormalities could suggest a potential etiology for the cognitive deficits. Parkinsonism maybe seen with dementia with Lewy bodies as well as other neurodegenerative disorders, motor neuron signs may be associated with FTD, and focal deficits consistent with a specific vascular distribution may suggest a vascular cause for the cognitiveimpairment.In addition to a general neurologic examination, a screening mental status examination, such as the MMSE, 3MS, or Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, should be administered.23–25 The severity of symptoms may be determined using assessments such as the Clinical Dementia Rating scale.2A formal neuropsychological battery also can be performed and should include tests that sufficiently challenge a patient in each cognitive domain.After adjusting for age and education, scores below 1.0 to 1.5 standard deviations below the mean typically indicate cognitive impairment on neuropsychological testing.26,119 Learning and recall tasks may differentiate subjects with MCI from those experiencing normal aging. On measures of general cognitive function such as the MMSE and full-scale IQ, the individual with MCI performs more similar to a normal elderly subject, whereas memory function on delayed verbal recall (Logical Memory II) and nonverbal delayed recall (Visual Reproductions II) more closely resembles mild Alzheimer disease.3 Although the screening mental status examination and neuropsychological battery may be useful, it is important to remember that these tests may not be sensitive to cognitive impairment. Individuals may score within the normal range, particularly those with high premorbid intellectual functioning. Despite normal scores, these patients may have MCI if the clinician determines that there has been a change from baseline functioning. In these circumstances, it is usually best to follow these patients clinically,with repeat evaluations at regular intervals.Laboratory tests used in the evaluation of dementia may identify medical issues that could affect cognitive function.120 Basic laboratory tests that look for reversible causes of cognitive impairment include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 levels, and folate levels. Neuroimaging with MRI or computed tomography of the brain is also recommended to look for any structural abnormalities that may be contributing to symptoms.Information from the history, screening mental status examination, neuropsychological testing, and ancillary studies should be used to determine if cognitive function is changing, normal, or impaired. Functional status can be obtained from the individual,the informant, or both. If the patient has experienced cognitive decline but has maintained most daily activities, then that individual can be given an MCI diagnosis. Once an individual has been diagnosed as having MCI, the clinician can determine the MCI subtype based on which cognitive domains are impaired. From this determination, theMCI subtype can be determined. If memory impairment is present, then the individual has an aMCI subtype. If memory is preserved but evidence of decline is seen in other cognitive domains, then the subtype is naMCI.After indicating the subtype as aMCI or naMCI, the next step is to determine if 1 or more cognitive domains are affected. If memory is the only domain affected, then the subtype would be aMCI single domain; if at least 1 other cognitive domain is also affected, then the subtype would be an aMCI multiple domain. If the impairment was isolated to one of the non memory domains, then the subtype would be naMCI single domain; if 2 or more non memory domains were affected, then the subtype would benaMCI multiple domains. Again, function must be essentially preserved to differentiate multiple domain MCI from dementia.The goal of such subtyping in clinical practice is to accurately describe the individual’s clinical syndrome and to determine the possible etiology of the patient’s symptoms. Using the history, examination, and ancillary data, the clinician can begin to deduce whether the cause of impairment is degenerative, vascular, psychiatric, or secondary to concomitant medical disorders. Such deductions may assist in providing treatment options for each patient.NATURAL PROGRESSION OF DISEASE AND OUTCOMES Because MCI is considered to be a transitional state between normal aging and dementia, the etiologies for dementia theoretically could be applied to MCI. Although The construct has yet to be validated, aMCI owing to a degenerative etiology is thought to progress most likely to Alzheimer disease, an assertion that has been endorsed in a practice parameter from the American Academy of Neurology.121 Our earliest work in the Mayo Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center taught us that even normal individuals change as they get older. Not only does reaction time slow,but on measures of Verbal IQ and measures of Performance IQ the things we do day in and day out are better preserved.122–124 In all of our attempts at providing care to the elderly, these are the principles that shaped us early and continue to play out in the advice we give out every day. Overlearned behaviors, repetitive tasks,and rehearsed activities make it easy and comfortable for us to go about the routines of the day. The things we are confronted with that take an element of problem solving become all the more difficult as we age.Although a diagnosis of MCI places an individual at higher risk for developing dementia, it does not indicate that the patient necessarily will progress to a dementia state.Although the majority of the patients with MCI in 1 large prospective trial progressed to Alzheimer disease at a rate of 7% to 10% per year, a small percentage of these individuals improved to normal.5 Others have been known to remain clinically stable for many years and may not develop dementia.125 These potential outcomes should be discussed with patients and their families after a diagnosis of MCI has been made.Pathology Studies of preclinical Alzheimer disease should be distinguished from studies of MCI.126In MCI studies, patients meet cognitive criteria for the diagnosis and are then followed prospectively to assess for conversion to Alzheimer disease. In contrast,preclinical Alzheimer disease refers to individuals with normal cognition who possess positive biomarkers for Alzheimer disease, such as a positive amyloid PET scan or evidence of Alzheimer disease biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid.127The Religious Orders Study has followed a group of nuns and priests for many years and has an achieved high autopsy rates. The study reports that approximately 60% of the participants with MCI have neuropathologic evidence of Alzheimer disease, butthat vascular disease also accounts for significant pathology.15 Other studies have implicated the importance and the findings of neurofibrillary tangle density to account for the symptoms of MCI.16,128 The best summary of outcomes after diagnosis of MCI was the results of a large autopsy series published in 2017. Of the 874 individuals ever diagnosed with MCI, final clinical diagnoses were varied: 39.2% died with an MCI diagnosis, 46.8% with a dementia diagnosis, and 13.9% with intact cognition. TheMCI diagnosis was usually associated with comorbid neuropathologies; fewer than one-quarter of MCI cases showed pure Alzheimer disease pathology.128 Two additional studies come from our own early investigations. We evaluated participants who died while their clinical classification was MCI and found that most had a low probability of having the neuropathologic features of Alzheimer disease at that point in time.17A second study observed participants who had been previously diagnosed with MCI and had progressed to dementia, and characterized these participants as having diagnostic pathology. This study indicated that, although most of the participants with aMCI developed Alzheimer disease, another sizable group(20%–30%) developed another type of dementing disorder.18 These studies remain in contrast with opinions that the discoverable pathology of MCI, albeit more advanced MCI, is only Alzheimer disease.19,20PET with fludeoxyglucose F 18 and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers also play a role in predicting conversion to different dementias in patients with MCI. Even in prodromal MCI (before clinical relevance), the array of diagnostic tools will help us in determining whether to use cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers or the expanding array of biomarker images to help us predict what therapy might work best with what precondition (Fig. 5).129 Erlangen scores refers to an algorithm that divides cerebrospinal fluid biomarker patterns into 5 groups, covering all possible cerebrospinal fluid result combinations based on the presence of pathologic tau and/or amyloid-b cerebrospinal fluid values.The PET with fludeoxyglucose F 18 statistical parametric classification uses statistical parametrical maps to normalize how scans are read and thus interpreted from one research center to another. Most likely, aMCI owing to a degenerative cause has similar features to clinically probable Alzheimer disease, with risk factors such as age, hypertension, and diabetes.27–29 APOE4 carrier status is a recognized genetic risk factor for the development of Alzheimer disease,30 but its value for detecting progression to cognitive impairment is less clear. It has been a consistent predictor but has not found a useful way into clinical practice.Some studies have suggested that APOE4 carrier status may have assist in predicting those more likely to convert from MCI to Alzheimer disease 126,127,130 and a synergistic effect with depression has been seen in cognitively normal individuals at risk for developing MCI. APOE4 carrier status also may be associated both with hippocampal atrophy in patients with MCI and with higher rates of cognitive decline in cognitively normal adults.131,132 However, others have shown that APOE4 carrier status itself has not been shown to predict cognitive decline or conversion to Alzheimer disease 133 and its routine use is not recommended 134; the diagnosis of MCI is made clinically.Suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathology MCI is a term that is increasingly used in research studies to denote individuals who meet the clinical criteria for MCI and show no evidence of amyloid pathology based on cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and/or amyloid PET imaging, but have evidence of neuronal injury as measured by either medial temporal lobe atrophy or hypometabolism on PET with fludeoxyglucose F 18.130,131In MCI with suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathology, low APOE e4and high APOE e2 carrier prevalence may account for differences in neurodegeneration patterns when measuring beta amyloid peptide load using florbetpir F-18 PET scanning and hippocampal volume determined by MRI.135 TREATMENT The early detection of cognitive decline theoretically may lead to the implementation of therapies that slow the progression of impairment. However, there currently is notreatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for MCI likely owing toAlzheimer disease. Because the etiologies of MCI can be heterogeneous, medicationstargeting a neurodegenerative cause theoretically would be different than those tar-geting cognitive impairment owing to vascular, psychiatric, or other medical disorders.Clinical trials nevertheless have focused on the aMCI subtype, with the goal of slowingthe progression to Alzheimer disease.The evidence is low that targeted cognitive interventions, taken as a group, mayhelp to improve performance on some cognitive measures but with no evidence offunctional benefit. The concept has further expanded to include a population of pa-tients where the condition may be reversible owing to a combination of disease,medical stressors, and acute illness. An Italian study evaluated the proportion ofMCI subjects who revert to normal cognition in a memory clinic context, focusingon the role of comorbidities. Between 2004 and 2013, 374 patients with MCI wererecruited. During a mean time of 3225.5 months, 21 (5.6%) reverted to normalcontrol. Subjects who reverted to normal cognition were younger (P5.0001),more educated (P5.0001), had a better global cognition (P5.0001), as assessedby the MMSE, and suffered from more comorbidities (P5.002), as assessed by Cu-mulative Illness Rating Scale than those who developed dementia.136There remainno known pharmacologic therapies for which evidence of lasting benefit has beendemonstrated in well-designed studies for patients with static or progressive condi-tions. Moderate evidence shows that people diagnosed with MCI can benefit fromregular physical exercise. Conceivably, if MCI were due to depression, it couldalso be treated with a drug. A number of studies have targeted medications used in the symptomatic treatmentof clinically probable Alzheimer disease. These medications have included 3 of the cholinesterase inhibitors, namely, donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine.137–139 Additionally, vitamin E and rofecoxib have been studied,137,140 because both oxidative damage and inflammation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease.141–144 Unfortunately, none of these interventions have shown a significant decrease in conversion rates of aMCI to Alzheimer disease, ranging from 6% to 17% in the medication arms versus 4% to 21% with placebo. However, 1 study did find that donepezil reduced the progression risk for 12 months in those with aMCI,an effect that persisted for up to 24 months in APOE4 carriers.137 Despite the results of clinical trial data, these studies do support the construct of MCI as a transitional state between normal cognition and Alzheimer disease. The overall progression rates for MCI in these studies ranged from 5% to 16%, which are higher than the incidence rate for Alzheimer disease in the general population.3,137 These rates suggest that patients who meet MCI criteria are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer disease. Because not all of those with MCI develop Alzheimer disease pathology, more accurate identification of these subjects is essential. Incorporating potential predictive biomarkers in clinical trials may assist in testing compounds that target the underlying disease process of Alzheimer disease.145A variety of nondrug interventions has also been tried on this population. Not surprisingly, cognitive training has been the most studied.86 There may even be some benefit from exercise.86 The environment of care has been addressed and lifestyle management has been included. Interventions range from individualized therapy togroup programs that additionally address activity planning, self-assertiveness training,relaxation techniques, stress management, use of external memory aids, and motor exercise. Multicomponent interventions seem to benefit activities of daily living,mood, and memory performance. A standardized cognitive training manual has been proposed as well further studies using a larger sample size and more robust experimental designs.146–148 Although no symptomatic or disease-modifying drug therapies are available for MCIowing to Alzheimer disease, there is much that can be done. The domains of cognition,function, and behavior define this population and where they reside in the spectrum of disease. Their preserved abilities can also serve as markers for how the disease is progressing and how well they are living within a defined environment. Even without a drug treatment for MCI, understanding the environment that surrounds every one of these patients and how they function within their universe is most important. Over-learned behaviors and an environment that limits or prohibits excess disabilities should be stressed, even for patients with MCI. Much can be done and running toward a diagnosis is better than running away from it.ADVANCE CARE PLANNING Cognitive impairment, be it MCI or dementia, can still be defined by the capacities that are preserved and the capacities that are lost. This is where the issue of driving comes into play, although the concept applies to all kinds of tasks and opportunities. Wecounsel that a diagnosis is not an all or none phenomenon and many individuals with MCI or even early dementia sit on advisory boards to provide a patient voice in better understanding the needs of the patient. Unfortunately, explaining these concepts and what is both retained and what is lost takes time, especially for the primary care provider. As our understanding of disease advances, the triad of cognition, function, and behavior not only defines the type of care that may be appropriate, but also contributes to our understanding of where the best site of care might be. Our ability to address the environment early in the care of patients with MCI or other age-dependent deficiencies may improve the quality of life for our patients, avoid common pitfalls and provide for more cost-effective and successful management of the person,and not just the disease they may have. A goal set by the Alzheimer’s Association back in 1987 was to create an environment where a person can function with minimal failure and maximal use of retained abilities. There is even more opportunity today to createthis success with earlier diagnosis and earlier intervention.Patients and families should be aware that those who have aMCI owing to a degenerative cause may have a 10% to 15% chance of developing dementia; however, it also should be noted that MCI is heterogeneous with a number of potential outcomes.125 Although some patients may not develop dementia, the label of “mild cognitive impairment” nevertheless may lead to psychological consequences, such as a feeling of uncertainty or concerns of becoming burdensome to others.149 Neuropsychiatric Symptoms such as depression, anxiety, apathy, and/or irritability also may be seen in those with MCI and may be associated with progression to Alzheimer disease.104 Encouraging patients and their families and caregivers to consider decisions about advance directives, future planning, and finances is essential, especially if the cognitive impairment is thought to be due to a degenerative cause. Although preventative strategies remain elusive, patients should be encouraged to follow a heart healthy diet, control for diabetes mellitus and hypertension, remain physically active, andengage intellectually and socially without frustration. Participation in a cognitive rehabilitation program also may be useful in patients with MCI, with improvements in activities of daily living, mood, and memory. Although these modifications may improve their overall quality of life, there has not been enough research to support that a decreased progression from a MCI to Alzheimer disease.SUMMARY The MCI construct implies an intermediate state between normal cognition and dementia. Individuals with MCI have (a) a subjective cognitive complaint that is usually corroborated by an informant, (b) preserved general cognitive functioning, (c) impairment in 1 or more of the cognitive domains (memory, attention–executive function, visuospatial skills, and/or language), and (d) essentially normal activities of daily living. Once the diagnosis of MCI has been made, the specific subtype can be determined, with a MCI referring to the presence of memory impairment and naMCI referring to the presence of impairment in 1 or more of the other domains with relative preservation of memory.MCI remains a clinical diagnosis, aided by a thorough history, neurologic examination, screening mental status examination, and formal neuropsychological testing.Although an individual with high premorbid intellectual functioning may score within the normal range on bedside and formal testing, that patient may still be considered to have MCI based on the judgment of the clinician. Because there is subjectivity in the clinical diagnosis, creating an operational definition for clinical trials has been a challenge. In addition, a number of etiologies can be associated with MCI, including degenerative and vascular processes, psychiatric causes, and comorbid medical conditions. Treatable medical conditions may also present as MCI and have reversible outcomes.Our goal with the geriatric patient remains the preservation of function and the amelioration of symptoms. Accurate diagnosis of MCI allows us to advise patients and families regarding placement, level of care needs, and quite possibly predict the future. Limiting transitions is in the best interest of all parties and allows for the maximal use of retained abilities while limiting the frustrations that accrue with cognitive and functional decline. We urge practitioners, providers, patients, and their family to be as precise as possible in evaluating cognitive and memory complaints given the wealth of information and diagnostic testing available regarding MCI. The accuracy of the diagnosis affects the outcome and experience of each individual and family that seek our opinion.","1.Reisberg B, Ferris SH, de Leon MJ, et al.

INTRODUCTION  Age is the most important risk factor for development of chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Aging  is  a  complex  process,  which  is  not  yet  fully  understood. In order to better understand the complex mammalian  aging  processes,  nine  hallmarks  of  aging  and  their  interrelatedness  were  recently  put  forward.  In  essence,  pri-mary  hallmarks  involve  acquisition  of  cell  biological  forms  of  damage  such  as  genomic  instability,  telomere  attrition,  epigenetic  alterations  and  loss  of  proteostasis.  Secondary  hallmarks  involve  antagonistic,  compensatory  responses  to  these  damages  such  as  deregulated  nutrient-sensing,  mitochondrial  dysfunction  and  cellular  senescence.  Lastly,  the  integrative hallmarks represent the result of the primary and secondary  events  such  as  stem  cell  exhaustion  and  inflammaging,  leading  to  deterioration  of  cellular  and  organismal  function as seen with aging [1].  Age-associated  changes  in  immune  function  termed  immunosenescence  are  thought  to  be  responsible  for  the  increased morbidity with age. Both the innate and the adaptive arm of the immune system undergo marked changes with age and contribute to the process of immunosenescence [2]. With age,  innate  immune  mechanisms  generally  become  more  active,  whereas  functioning  of  the  adaptive  immune  system  generally declines. Immunosenescence is characterized by i) thymic involu-tion  leading  to  a  steady  decline  in  the  production  of  naïve  T-cells,   ii)   shrinkage   of   the   T-cell   repertoire   through   continuous antigen stimulation favoring the development of functionally  altered,  oligoclonal,  senescent  T-cells  identi-fied  by  CD28  loss  and  iii)  a  chronic  low  degree  of  inflam-mation  termed  inflammaging  as  evidenced  by  increased  serum levels of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-, IL-6  and  acute  phase  proteins  [3].  These  changes  in  cellular  composition     and     cellular     functions     create     a     pro-inflammatory  environment  which  might  accelerate  devel-opment of RA.  RA is a chronic auto-inflammatory disorder targeting the joints.  Although  RA  can  develop  in  individuals  of  any  age,  its  incidence  continues  to  increase  with  age  into  the  seventh  decade  [4].  When  compared  to  healthy  individuals  of  the  same  age,  RA  patients  show  significantly  more  prominent  features  of  immune  system  aging.  Despite  the  growing  ex-perimental  data,  the  question  whether  accelerated  immu-nosenescence  is  a  primary  cause  of  RA  or  an  event  secon-dary  to  the  chronic  inflammatory  process  remains  to  be  an-swered.  In  this  review  we  summarize  the  experimental  evidence  for  the  pre-aged  phenotype  of  different  immune  cells  in  RA  and  their  relevance  to  disease  pathogenesis.  We  also  com-pare features of senescence in peripheral versus local tissues (bone marrow, peripheral blood and the inflamed joint). Fur-thermore,  we  outline  the  contribution  of  the  hallmarks  of  aging  to  the  pre-aged  phenotype  in  RA.  Also,  the  effects  of  treatment  on  the  reversibility  of  immunosenescence  in  RA  are  discussed.  Lastly,  novel  insights  in  the  molecular  pathogenesis  of  RA  relevant  to  the  development  of  the  pre-aged  phenotype may guide adequate design of conclusive patient-based research to solve this issue. 2.    EVIDENCE    FOR    A    PRE-AGED    PHENOTYPE        IN RA 2.1. Immunosenescence and T Lymphocytes in RA Although  aging  affects  all  cells  of  the  immune  system,  T-cells appear to be most sensitive. A prominent feature of T-cell  aging  is  the  oligoclonal  expansion  of  CD4+  and  especially   CD8+   T-cells   lacking   expression   of   the   co-stimulatory molecule CD28. CD28 co-stimulation, required for  efficient  T-cell  activation  and  proliferation,  is  progressively  lost  with  age  [3].  Consequences  of  CD28  loss  differ  between  CD4+  and  CD8+  T-cells;  in  CD8+  T-cells  loss  of  CD28  can  lead  to  dysfunction  or  towards  a  regulatory  phenotype, whereas in CD4+ T-cells CD28 deficiency is associated  with  acquisition  of  novel  NK-like  functionalities.  Loss  of  CD28  in  CD4+  T-cells  is  associated  with  an  increased   production   of   pro-inflammatory   cytokines,   increased  cytotoxicity,  via  expression  of  perforin  and  granzyme  B  and  a  propensity  to  migrate  into  tissues.  Interestingly, CD4+CD28- T-cells were found expanded in patients with several chronic autoimmune conditions, including RA. Expansions  were  seen  in  both  early  and  late  RA  patients  and    were    more    prominent    in    carriers    of    the    RA-susceptibility  HLA-DRB1*04  alleles  [5].  This  suggested  that  accelerated  immunosenescence  is  a  genetically-driven  phenomenon   that   might   be   causal   to   RA   development   rather than the consequence of disease.       Novel  functional  features  of  senescent  CD28-  T-cells  have  been  associated  with  phenotypic  changes,  such  as  de novo  expression  of  NK  receptors:  Immunoglobulin  (Ig)-like  (i.e.  killer  cell  activating  receptors  [KAR],  killer  cell  inhibi-tory  receptors  [KIR])  [6-8]  and  C-type  lectin-like  superfa-mily  (NKG2D)  receptors  [9,  10].  KIRs  and  KARs  are  spe-cific  for  classical  MHC  class  I  molecules  (HLA-A,  HLA-B,  HLA-C)  and  the  non-classical  MHC  molecule  HLA-G  [11].  Ligands for NKG2D include the stress-induced MHC class I polypeptide-related  sequence  (MIC)  proteins.  MIC  proteins  were  found  upregulated  by  RA  synoviocytes  [10].  Also,  CD28-  T-cells  in  RA  patients  demonstrated  increased  ex-pression  of  NK  cell-associated  receptors  CD56  [9,  12,  13]  and CD57 [14].       Upregulation   of   NK   receptors   likely   serves   a   co-stimulatory role in CD28- T-cells. Cross-linking of KAR in the    presence    of    anti-CD3    induced    proliferation    of    CD4+CD28-  T-cells  [6].  Engagement  of  NKG2D,  in  the  presence  of  anti-CD3,  induced  proliferation,  IFN-  and  TNF- secretion [10]. Triggering of CD56 alone led to the production  of  IL-2,  TNF-  and  MIP-1  [12].  Furthermore,  several studies showed upregulation of CD70, a member of the TNF superfamily, by CD28- T-cells [15-17]. CD70 ex-pression  lowered  the  activation  threshold  of  CD28-  T-cells  [15].  In  line  with  their  pro-inflammatory  potential,  RA  pa-tient-derived  peripheral  blood  (PB)  CD4+CD28-  T-cells  [14,  18,  19]  and  CD4+CD28-  T-cell  clones  [14]  produced  significantly  higher  levels  of  TNF-  and  IFN-  than  their  CD28+ counterparts.  The  exact  role  of  senescent  T-cells  in  the  clinical  course  of  RA  is  still  unclear.  Numbers  of  circulating  CD4+CD28-  T-cells did not correlate with RA clinical parameters such as C-reactive  protein  (CRP),  level  of  anti-cyclic  citrullinated  protein  antibodies  (ACPA),  swollen  and  tender  joint  counts  or  disease  duration  [14,  20,  21].  Some  studies  demonstrated  a  correlation  between  CD4+CD28-  T-cells  and  erosions  in  RA  [22,  23]  but  this  was  not  confirmed  by  others  [21,  24].  Expansions  of  CD4+CD28-  T-cells  in  RA  have  been  impli-cated in the development of atherosclerotic disease [24] and in extra-articular manifestations [21, 24]. The  role  of  senescent  T-cells  at  the  level  of  the  joint  in  RA  also  remains  unclear.  Several  studies  demonstrated  that  CD4+CD28-  T-cells  are  less  frequent  in  RA  synovial  fluid  (SF)  or  synovium  than  in  PB  [14,18,  20,  25].  This  seems  to  contradict  the  tissue  tracking  propensity  of  CD4+CD28-  cells  suggested  based  on  the  expression  of  adhesion  mole-cules  facilitating  tissue  infiltration  (CD11a,  CD49d)  [9,  18,  26]  and  receptors  (NKG2D,  CX3CR1)  which  ligands  (MIC,  fractalkine)  are  readily  expressed  in  RA  tissue  [9,  10].  A  possible  explanation  may  involve  the  restoration  of  CD28  expression  by  IL-12  [27]  which  is  abundantly  expressed  in  RA  joints  [28].  Consistent  with  this  explanation,  several  similarities between PB CD28- and SF CD28+CD4+ T-cells have   been   demonstrated.   These   include   the   methylation   status  of  IFN-  promoter,  expression  of  CXCR3,  CCR6,  CCR7 [19] and clonotypic composition [25].  Several studies highlighted the importance of CX3CR1, a chemokine  receptor  exclusively  expressed  by  CD4+CD28-  T-cells [9, 29, 30] and its ligand fractalkine (FKN) expressed by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), as co-stimulatory pair relevant  to  the  local  inflammatory  process.  The  CX3CR1-FKN  interaction  between  CD4+CD28-  T-cells  and  FLS  in-duced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and relayed survival  signals.  Furthermore,  the  CX3CR1-FKN  interaction  facilitated proliferation of FLS [29, 30]. It has been suggested that CD4+CD28- T-cells in RA are autoreactive.  So  far,  conclusive  evidence  for  this  notion  is  lacking.  RA-derived  CD4+CD28-  T-cell  clones  were  shown  to proliferate in response to autologous adherent cells in vitro[25],  while  CD4+CD28-NKG2D+  T-cell  clones  secreted  IFN-  when  cultured  with  autologous  MIC+  synoviocytes  [10]. CD4+CD28- T-cells did not respond to collagen type II [18],  a  putative  RA-associated  autoantigen.  In  contrast,  the  reactivity  of  CD4+CD28-  T-cells  towards  CMV  has  been  clearly  demonstrated,  and  did  not  differ  between  RA-  and  healthy  control  (HC)-derived  or  RA-  and  multiple  sclerosis-derived  senescent  T-cells  [18,  31,  32].  Thus,  clonally  ex-panded  CD4+CD28-  T-cells  in  RA  are  likely  CMV-specific  but  may  also  include  selfreactive  clones  [31].  Senescence  features  reported  in  various  stages  of  T-cell  development  in  RA are depicted in the Fig. (1). 2.2. CMV as Accelerator of T-cell Immunosenescence       CMV  infection  has  been  demonstrated  to  drive  immu-nosenescence directly, by imposing chronic replicative stress and  indirectly,  by  induction  of  IFN-  expression  by  plas-macytoid  dendritic  cells  (PDC).  IFN-  has  been  shown  to  accelerate  differentiation  and  telomere  shortening  through  inhibition of telomerase activity [33]. Latent   CMV   infection   has   been   linked   to   a   pro-inflammatory state as evidenced by increased systemic levels of  IL-6  and  TNF-  [34].  TNF-  is  known  to  downregulate  CD28  expression  [35].  Latent  CMV  infection  was  found  to  aggravate  the  clinical  course  of  RA  [36].  CMV-specific  CD4+CD28- T-cells were found increased in CMV+ but not CMV- RA patients [20]. These cells represented potent pro-ducers of IFN- [20, 36, 37].  Despite  its  role  in  the  development  of  an  immunosenes-cent  phenotype,  numerous  studies  undermine  the  notion  of  CMV  involvement  in  RA  pathogenesis.  The  most  obvious,  epidemiological  evidence  shows  a  worldwide  CMV  prevalence of 40-99%, while only ~1% of all individuals develop RA.  A  study  by  Pierer  et  al.  which  included  large  cohorts  (>200 subjects each) of RA patients and HC, showed similar prevalence of CMV infection as well as comparable titers of anti-CMV antibodies in these groups [36]. Presence  of  CMV-specific  T-cells,  CMV  DNA  or  CMV  early  antigen  protein  has  been  demonstrated  in  RA  synovial  tissue  or  synovial  fluid  but  also  at  inflammatory  sites  of  other autoimmune conditions [38-43].  In  conclusion,  CMV-driven  T-cell  immunosenescence  is  well established in both HC and in RA patients. The data on CD28-  T-cells  imply  that  these  cells  contribute  to  the  inflammatory  milieu  in  several  chronic  inflammatory  conditions  including  RA.  Also,  CD28-  cells  may  be  involved  in  (extra articular)  tissue  injury.  Their  contribution  to  joint  pathology  is  hard  to  establish,  partly  because  cells  may  regain  CD28  expression  via  an  IL-12  dependent  mechanism  at  the  level of the joint.  2.3. Immunosenescence and B Lymphocytes in RA B-cells  play  an  important  role  in  RA  pathogenesis  based  on  their  ability  to  produce  and  secrete  autoantibodies  and  their role as antigen presenting cells [44-47]. Aging has pronounced  effects  on  both  numbers  and  functions  of  B-cells.  Available  evidence  shows  a  decline  of  PB  B-cells  with  age  [48].  Yet,  peripheral  B-cell  numbers  were  not  further  decreased  in  newly-diagnosed  RA  patients  when  compared  to  age-matched controls [49].  To the best of our knowledge, no studies have elucidated whether  B-cells  from  RA  patients  show  features  of  premature  senescence.  Recently,  Rubtsov  et  al.  identified  a  novel  population  of  age-associated  B-cells  (ABCs),  defined  as  CD19+CD11b+CD11c+,  in  aged  female  mice.  ABCs  were  significantly  increased  in  autoimmune-prone  mouse  strains  at the onset of autoimmune disease and were found to be the main source of autoantibody production. The human equivalent  of  mouse  ABCs,  defined  as  CD19+CD11c+CD21-  B-cells,  were  identified  in  the  PB  of  some  elderly  female  patients  with  RA  [50].  Further  studies  are  required  to  confirm  the  accumulation  and  functional  role  of  ABCs  in  RA  pathogenesis.  Besides  the  increase  of  potentially  pathogenic  B-cells,  a  decrease  of  IL-10  producing  B-cells  may  contribute  to RA development. Both the number and function of immature  transitional  B-cells  (with  CD19+CD24 high CD38 high  phe-no type)  regarded  as  the  main  IL-10  producers  among  B-cells, were found to decrease with age. The frequency of IL-10-expressing  cells  among  CD24 high CD38 high B-cells  was  negatively correlated with rheumatoid factor (RF) titers [51]. In  conclusion,  although  it  is  evident  that  aging  and  inflammation affect B-cell numbers and functional subsets, there is no  sound  evidence  to  support  a  role  of  senescent  B-cells  in  RA pathogenesis.  2.4. Immunosenescence and NK-cells in RA Aging-associated  numerical,  phenotypical  and  functional  changes  in  NK-cells  have  been  comprehensively  reviewed [52-55].  Healthy  aging  is  associated  with  an  increase  in  the  number  of  NK-cells,  mainly  attributed  to  the  expansion  of  the differentiated, mature CD56dim subset that develops from the immature CD56bright subset [56]. CD56bright NK-cells were reported to either decrease [57, 58] or remain stable with age [56].  While  NK-cell  cytotoxicity  is  well-preserved  with  age  [57], the cytokine and chemokine expression pattern of NK-cells,  their  proliferative  capacity  and  their  responsiveness  to  cytokines were impaired upon aging [56, 57, 59].  In  contrast  to  healthy  elderly,  RA  patients  are  character-ized  by  a  decline  of  peripheral  NK-cell  numbers  [60-62].  A  decline  of  these  cells  may  accelerate  senescence  in  RA  pa-tients.  Support  for  this  notion  comes  from  studies  demon-strating  that  NK-cells  clear  senescent  cells  in  tumor  lesions  [63] and eliminate senescent cells involved in tissue damage [64].  These  data  indicate  an  immunosurveillant  role  of  NK-cells in RA senescence rather than a pro-inflammatory role.  2.5. Immunosenescence and Monocytes in RA       Three  different  monocyte  subsets  can  be  distinguished  based  on  surface  expression  of  CD14  and  CD16  [65,  66],  namely  the  classical  monocytes  (CD14bright  CD16-),  the  in-termediate   monocytes   (CD14bright   CD16+)   and   the   non-classical  monocytes  (CD14dimCD16bright).  The  latter  subset  has been suggested to represent senescent monocytes, due to a  shorter  telomere  length  compared  to  classical  monocytes  and  expression  of  the  senescence-associated   -galactosidase  (SA-gal)   [67,   68].   The   CD14dimCD16bright   non-classical   monocytes  are  also  more  pro-inflammatory  and  express  chemokine  receptors  facilitating  migration  to  tissues  at  sig-nificantly  higher  levels  than  classical  monocytes  [67,  69].  CD14dimCD16bright  monocytes  were  found  to  be  similarly  increased in elderly individuals with atherosclerosis and RA patients when compared to young subjects [67, 70].  Another population of monocytes that was increased with age  is  the  CD56  NK  receptor-expressing  monocyte  subset.  These  CD14brightCD56+  monocytes  were  found  to  be  potent  producers  of  cytokines  and  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS).  Interestingly,  only  young  RA  patients  (<40  years)  showed  CD14brightCD56+  monocyte  expansion  when  compared  to  HC.  As  the  number  of  CD14 bright CD56+  monocytes  did  not  correlate  with  disease  duration,  medication  or  C-reactive  protein  levels,  the  cause  of  the  reported  increase  in  these  young  RA  patients  remains  unclear  [71].  More  studies  are  needed   to   elucidate   the   nature   of   senescence-associated   changes  of  monocyte  populations  and  to  establish  whether  these  alterations  are  more  profound  in  RA  patients  than  in  aging per se. In  conclusion,  ample  evidence  supports  a  pre-aged  phenotype   in   RA   patients   within   the   T-cell   compartment,   whereas  for  other  PB  cells  this  is  less  evident.  The  culprit  phenotype  is  represented  by  late  stage,  pro-inflammatory  T-cells  that  have  lost  CD28  expression.  Senescent  cells  may  thrive  because  NK-cell  surveillance  is  significantly  reduced  in RA.  3. THE NINE HALLMARKS OF AGING AND RA Nine common denominators of aging have recently been proposed [1]. The aim of this paragraph is to summarize the available  evidence  for  the  presence  of  these  senescence  hallmarks in the context of RA. 3.1. Genomic Instability Cellular  senescence  or  stable  cell  cycle  arrest  can  be  either  telomere-dependent  (discussed  in  “3.2.  Telomere  shortening”)  or  telomere-independent.  The  latter  develops  as  a  consequence  of  DNA  damage  accumulation  due  to  replication  errors,  ROS,  genotoxic  drugs  or  UV  light.  Excessive  DNA  damage  (including  telomere  erosion)  evokes  a  persistent  DNA  damage  response  (DDR)  which  induces  senescence or programmed cell death, both representing means to prevent  malignant  transformation.  Factors  involved  in  cell  fate determination are not known but may include the extent of DNA damage, the strength and duration of DDR signaling and the type of the affected cell [72-74]. Elevated levels of DNA double-strand breaks were demonstrated in PB mononuclear cells (PBMC) [75, 76], or isolated  naïve  and  memory  CD4+  T  lymphocytes  [77,  78]  but  not  neutrophils  [79]  from  RA  patients  compared  to  HC.  Similarly  increased  levels  of  DNA  double-strand  breaks  were  seen  in  naïve  CD4+  T-cells  from  treatment-naïve  recently diagnosed RA patients [77]. Also, increased levels of mutagenic  DNA  adducts  such  as  8-oxo-guanine  (8-oxo-7-hydroxydeoxyguanosine  or  8-hydroxyguanine)  or  Heptanone-Etheno-2’-Deoxycytidine (H dC) were found. 8-oxo-guanine and  H dC  represent  markers  of  oxidative  DNA  damage.  In  RA,  levels  of  8-oxo-dG  and  H dC  were  found  significantly  increased within DNA derived from urine [80], whole blood cells  [81],  PBMC  [75],  CD4+  T-cells  [77]  and  naïve  CD4+  T-cells [78]. Accumulation of DNA damage in T-cells of RA patients has been associated with defects in DNA repair mechanisms. First evidence came from studies demonstrating an impaired ability of RA patient-derived PBMC to repair the mutagenic base  lesion  O6-methylguanine  induced  by  the  methylating  carcinogen   N-methyl-N-nitrosourea   [82-84].   Also,   a   decreased  rate  of  repairing  double-strand  DNA  breaks  by  RA-derived  PBMC  has  been  demonstrated  using  the  DNA  unwinding  in  alkaline  solution  assay  [76].  Studies  by  Shao  et al.  demonstrated  accumulated  DNA  damage  in  both  naïve  and  memory  T-cells  from  newly-diagnosed  RA  patients  and  related  this  to  decreased  levels  of  the  DNA  repair  kinase  ataxia  telangiectasia  mutated  (ATM).  ATM  deficiency  was  shown to recapitulate the pre-aged phenotype as seen in RA T-cells  whereas  overexpression  of  ATM  reconstituted  DNA  repair  capabilities  [77,  78].  Thus,  both  the  increase  in  DNA  damage-inducing  events  such  as  replicative  and  oxidative  stress  as  well  as  the  impaired  levels  of  proteins  involved  in  DNA repair are likely the cause of DNA damage accumulation and permanent growth arrest of RA T-cells. 3.2. Telomere Shortening Telomere erosion is recognized by the cell as a persistent DNA  damage  [85-87].  Telomere-dependent  cell  cycle  arrest  is  mediated  by  upregulation  of  the  p53-dependent  DNA  damage  pathway  [88].  Telomeres  shorten  50-100  bp  after  each replication cycle, due to the end-replication problem of DNA polymerase [85, 88]. Activation of telomerase prevents replicative  senescence  by  maintaining  telomere  function Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of the catalytic   unit   called   the   telomerase   reverse   transcriptase   (hTERT)  and  telomerase  RNA  (TERC).  Elongation  of  telomeres  occurs  through  de  novo  reverse  transcription.  Expression  of  hTERT  is  a  limiting  factor  for  telomerase  activity.  In  healthy  conditions,  telomerase  is  active  only  in  stem  cells and activated T and B lymphocytes [89].  Compared  to  age-matched  HC,  RA  patients  showed  enhanced  telomere  shortening  in  granulocytes  [5],  PBMC  [90]  and  CD4+  T-cells  [5].  The  latter  was  attributed  to  telomere  erosion of naive, but not memory CD4+ T-cells by Koetz et al.   [91].   Similarly,   telomerase   activity   following   TCR-dependent  stimulation  was  found  to  be  significantly  decreased  in  naive,  but  not  memory,  CD4+  T-cells.  hTERT  deficiency was associated with a reduced proliferative capacity  and  a  higher  apoptosis  rate  of  naïve  T-cells.  In  contrast,  lymphocytes infiltrating the synovium were characterized by high  telomerase  activity,  indicative  of  their  activated  status.  The telomerase activity levels of infiltrating cells were correlated  with  intensity  of  synovial  lining  hyperplasia,  suggest-ing active lymphocyte involvement in joint destruction [92]. Interestingly,   telomerase   activity   of   anti-CD3   stimulated   PBMC  was  similarly  decreased  in  patients  with  early  RA,  multiple  sclerosis  and  patients  with  flu-like  symptoms  [93],  indicating lack of RA-specificity of telomerase insufficiency. 3.3. Changes in Gene Regulation Aging  is  associated  with  alterations  of  epigenetic  processes. These include mechanisms involved in gene regulation at  the  transcriptional  level,  i.e.  histone  modifications  (acetylation  and  methylation),  DNA  methylation,  chromatin  remodeling  and  mechanisms  involved  in  post-transcriptional  gene regulation, i.e. non-coding (nc)RNAs expression [1]. A growing body of data demonstrates a substantial role of environmental factors in modulation of the epigenome [94]. Low RA  concordance  rates  between  monozygotic  twins  (~15%)  [95-98],  suggest  a  high  relevance  of  the  interplay  between  genetics  and  environmentally-influenced  epigenetic  alterations in RA pathogenesis.       Epigenetic  changes  are  characteristic  of  RA  synoviocytes.  Reported  epigenetic  alterations  include  global  hypomethylation  [99,  100],  local  hypomethylation  of  LINE-1  and  DR-3  promoters  [101,  102],  increased  HDAC  activity  [103,  104],  Sirt1  overexpression  [105]  and  hyperacetylation [104],  local  H4  acetylation  within  MMP-1  promoter  [106],  sumoylation [107], and distinct pattern of microRNA expression [108]. 3.3.1. Histone Modifications      One  of  the  age-associated  post-transcriptional  (epigenetic)  modifications  include  histone  acetylation  [1].  Histone  acetylation  at  lysine  residues,  mediated  by  histone  acetyl-transferases  (HAT),  leads  to  decreased  levels  of  chromatin  condensation,  allowing  recruitment  of  the  transcriptional  machinery  and  ensuing  gene  transciption.  Inhibition  of  gene  expression, by removal of acetyl groups, is mediated by his-tone deacetylases (HDAC) [109]. Aging has been associated with  a  general  increase  of  the  histone  acetylation  status,  as  evidenced  by  increased  H4K16  acetylation  and  decreased  expression  of  the  class  III  HDAC  (NAD-dependent  protein  deacetylases sirtuins [Sirt]) [1].  An      in  vitro  study  employing  RA  synovial  fibroblasts  demonstrated a TNF--induced increase in HDAC and Sirt1 activity, suggesting that altered histone acetylation may be a feature  of  inflammation  [110,  111].  Moreover,  RA  patient  derived   PBMC   demonstrated   increased   HDAC   activity   [112],  but  no  specific  change  of  Sirt1  activity  [105].  The  current available data suggest that histone acetylation is dif-ferently modulated in aging and RA. 3.3.2. DNA Methylation       Chromatin  methylation  changes  the  chromatin  structure  to  a  more  compact  and  less  easily  accessible  state  for  tran-scription  factors.  Depending  on  the  gene  and  cell  type,  both  an  age-associated  decrease  or  increase  in  methylation  status  may  occur.  Decreased  methylation  status  leads  to  enhanced  mRNA  and  protein  expression  [113,  114].  Methylation  oc-curs  at  deoxycytosine,  primarily  within  CpG  islands  (re-peated  CpG  sequences)  which  are  associated  with  ~70%  of  the  promotors  in  the  vertebrate  genome.  Age-associated  methylation  changes  have  also  been  found  to  affect  genes  lacking CpG islands, i.e. CD11a (LFA-1) [115]. Methylation is  mediated  by  DNA  methyltransferase  Dnmt1,  involved  in  the  preservation  of  the  methylation  pattern  after  each  cell  division, and methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, which mediate methylation of previously unmethylated DNA [116]. Both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a expression generally decrease with age [114]. Decreased methylation status has been reported in aging cells of various types, including fibroblasts [117] and stem cells  [118].  Hypomethylation  of  a  single  CpG  in  the  IL-6  promoter  region  was  found  more  frequent  in  RA  PBMC  when  compared  to  HC  PBMC.  High  levels  of  IL-6  mRNA  in  LPS-stimulated  macrophages  were  associated  with  this  single CpG hypomethylation [119]. The most apparent link between  hypomethylation  and  autoimmunity,  however,  is  constituted by the demonstration that functional alterations in  senescent  CD4+CD28-  T-cells  are  brought  about  by  changes  in  DNA  methylation.  Relative  to  the  CD4+CD28+  T-cell  population,  Dnmt1  and  Dnmt3a  levels  and  the  DNA  methylation  status  were  significantly  decreased  in  senes-cent CD4+CD28- T-cells. Genes overexpressed in response to hypomethylation included those associated with effector functions   of   senescent   cells,   i.e.   IFN-   [19]   CD70,   KIR2DL4 and perforin [16, 17]. Decreased levels of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3 in RA CD4+CD28- T-cells are the consequence of impaired signaling of the ERK and JNK pathways. Simi-lar  defects  have  been  noted  in  CD4+CD28-  T-cells  gener-ated in   vitro   by   repeated   stimulation   as   wells   as   in   CD4+CD28-  T-cells  from  elderly  subjects  [17].  Interest-ingly,  SF-derived  CD4+  T-cells  showed  prominent  hy-pomethylation  of  the  IFN-  promoter  (IFNG),  irrespective  of CD28 expression [19]. 3.3.3. Chromatin Remodeling Chromatin  remodeling  is  mediated  by  enzymes  involved  in  DNA  and  histone  post-transcriptional  modifications  as  well   as   Heterochromatin   Protein   1   (HP1),   Polycomb   Group  (PcG)  or  the  Nucleosome  Remodeling  and  Deacety-lase  (NuRD)  protein  complexes.  Their  expression  levels  de-crease  during  aging  [1].  RA-derived  synovial  fibroblasts  showed altered levels of the PcG protein EZH2 [120]. 3.3.4. ncRNAs The best studied group of ncRNAs in both health and RA are  the  microRNAs  (miRNAs).  These  miRNAs  are  small  (~22  nucleotides)  single-stranded  RNAs  that  have  emerged  as  important  post  -transcriptional  regulators  of  gene  expres-sion based on limited sequence complementarity.        The  aging-associated  epigenetic  changes  influence  ex-pression  of  miRNAs.  The  role  of  specific  miRNAs  in  RA  has recently been reviewed [121]. Here we will review the miRNAs  that  link  changes  in  gene  regulation,  aging  and  RA.  Twenty-four  miRNAs  have  been  reported  to  be  in-volved  in  gene  regulation  with  aging  [122].  MiRNA’s  may  cause aberrant DNA methylation. For example, the miR-29 gene  family,  miR-143,  miR-148a  and  miR-152  all  target  Dnmt3a  and  Dnmt3b.  MiRNAs  that  are  implicated  in  both  gene  regulation  with  aging  and  in  RA  are  miR-16,  miR-124a  and  miR-125a.  The  expression  level  of  miR-16  was  elevated  in  PBMC  of  RA  patients  with  active  disease  and  correlated  with  the  erythrocyte  sedimentation  rate  (ESR),  CRP and disease activity score 28 (DAS28) [123]. HDAC1, HDAC2  and  HDAC3  transcripts  are  all  proven  targets  of  miR-16.  It  is  currently  not  known  if  higher  miR-16  levels  also correspond with lower levels of HDAC transcripts and thus  increased  histone  acetylation  in  RA  patient-derived  PBMC.  MiR-124a  was  down  regulated  in  RA  synovial  fi-broblasts  [124].  MiR-124a  targets  the  3`  UTR  of  mRNAs  encoding  MCP-1  and  CDK-2.  MiR-124a  down  regulation  thus  promotes  the  production  of  MCP-1  and  CDK-2  proteins  by  RA  synovial  fibroblasts.  Also,  miR-124  (among  others)  is  thought  to  regulate  EZH2,  a  component  of  the  polycomb  repressive  complex,  involved  in  chromatin  remodeling in various cell types.  Pathways most affected by ageing include genes involved in  post  transcriptional  events  such  as  mRNA  splicing  [125]  Hu  antigen  R  (HuR)  is  one  of  the  splicing  control  proteins.  HuR  is  an  RNA  binding  protein  which  stabilizes  mRNA,  thereby  regulating  gene  expression  [126].  Increased  miR-125a  levels  correlate  inversely  with  HuR  in  various  tumor  cells  and  miR-125a  targets  the  ELAV  gene  transcript  that  encodes  the  HuR  protein  levels,  thereby  regulating  HuR  expression  [126].  MiR-125a  levels  were  elevated  in  plasma  from RA patients. These increased plasma levels may reflect the down modulation of HuR expression in PBMC from RA patients [127].  3.4. Loss of Protein Homeostasis Exogenous or endogenous stressors can lead to unfolding of  proteins.  Heat  shock  proteins  (hsps)  are  stress-induced  chaperones  that  refold  these  proteins  or  target  them  for  destruction  in  autophagosomes.  The  age-associated  decline  of  hsps is associated with reduced longevity [1].  Interestingly,  an  increased  expression  of  several  hsps  in  RA  patient-derived  PBMC  [128]  as  well  as  in  RA  synovial  tissue  and  fluid  has  been  reported  [129-132].  Hsps  are  upregulated  in  arthritic  joints,  likely  in  response  to  stress-induced  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER)  hyperreactivity  and  increased protein turnover. Substantial data support a role for chaperones as autoantigens for T- and B-cells in RA; including  detection  of  hsp-specific  autoantibodies  [129,  130,  133-135],  presence  of  autoreactivity-inducing  citrulline  groups  within  hsps  [136],  ability  to  interact  with  RA-associated  HLA-DRB1*0401  allele  [137]  and  stimulation  of  T-cell  responses  [129,  130,  138,  139].  In  RA  patients,  hsps  serve  as  targets of the pathological immune response and their levels do not decline as demonstrated in aging. Damaged, unfolded or incorrectly folded proteins which cannot  be  re-folded  by  hsps,  are  degraded  by  cellular  proteolytic   systems   such   as   the   ubiquitin-proteasome   and   lysosomal  systems.  This  process  is  impaired  with  age  and  leads,  in  tandem  with  the  decrease  of  chaperone  functions,  to  accumulation  and  aggregation  of  erroneous  proteins.  Together,  this  results  in  an  age-associated  loss  of  tissue  function [1].  Autophagy  is  a  mechanism  that  involves  degradation  of  cellular  components  through  the  actions  of  lysosomes.  The  breakdown of cellular components promotes cellular survival during  stress  by  maintaining  cellular  energy  levels.  Autophagy  is  thus  an  important  process  relevant  to  protein  homeostasis,  energy  metabolism  and  cell  death  [140].  Normal  aging generally reduces autophagy [1].        The  joint  environment  imposes  ER  stress  to  synovial  cells due to a high protein turnover [141-143]. Consequently, autophagy  is  significantly  increased  in  RA  synovial  fibroblasts.  Enhanced  autophagy  correlated  with  reduced  apoptosis. This led to the assumption that autophagy protects synovial  cells  from  cell  death.  However,  in  a  recent  study  using  ex vivo cultured synovial fibroblasts the authors showed that autophagy  may  also  promote  death  of  RA  synovial  fibroblasts   [144].   Both   apoptosis-resistance   and   apoptosis-induction  by  autophagy  represent  means  of  responding  to  increased  levels  of  stressors  within  the  inflamed  RA  joints.  Modulation of autophagy in synovial fibroblasts in RA joints was shown to depend on TNF- [144-146].        Similar  to  the  autophagy-lysosomal  system,  also  ele-ments of the ubiquitin-proteasome system have been found altered in RA synovial fibroblasts [144, 145, 147]. A single nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP)  mapping  to  the  E3  ubiq-uitin  ligase  -  cullin1  (CUL1)  gene  locus,  has  been  associ-ated with RA susceptibility in the Japanese [148] and north Indian populations [149]. E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase syno-violin, was increased not only in synovial fibroblasts in the joint  [150-152],  but  also  within  PBMC  and  serum  of  RA  patients  [153].  Synoviolin  has  been  suggested  to  render  synovial  cells  resistant  to  apoptosis  induced  by  ER  stress  [152]. Upregulation of synoviolin in vitro by fibroblast-like synoviocytes was TNF--dependent [151]. These data sug-gest  that  inflammation-mediated  ER  stress  alters  proteosta-sis and that altered proteostasis may enhance inflammation, thereby amplifying the local inflammatory response in RA.       Yang      et  al.  reported  that  RA  naïve  T-cells  are  auto-phagy-deficient.  The  authors  provide  evidence  that  RA  T-cells  are  in  an  energy-deprived  state  and  thereby  rendered  apoptosis-sensitive.  Increased  apoptosis  of  naive  CD4+  T-cells in RA patients may lead to increased homeostatic pro-liferation  and  early  senescence  of  the  T-cell  pool  [154].  Thus, metabolic defects may be responsible for loss of pro-teostasis  in  RA  naïve  T  cells  and  may  underlie  their  accel-erated senescence.  3.5. Altered Nutrient-Sensing      Pathways  involved  in  nutrient-sensing  are  thought  to  have a critical role in aging, as suggested by the overall positive   effects   of   caloric   restriction   on   lifespan.   Nutrient-sensing  pathways  whose  dysregulation  is  consequential  for  aging  include  insulin  and  insulin-like  growth  factor-1  (IGF-1)  signaling  (IIS)  and  the  mTOR  pathway  [1].  Intriguingly,  IGF-1  deficiency  may  shorten  or  extend  lifespan,  a  paradox  which   remains   unresolved   at   present.   Pituitary-derived   growth hormone (GH) induces IGF-1 production in the liver, and IGF-1 suppresses GH in a negative feedback loop [155]. IGF-1  represents  one  of  two  ligands  of  the  IGF  family,  which also consists of six IGF binding proteins (BP). Avail-ability of IGF-1 for the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is regulated mostly  by  IGFBP-3  due  to  its  highest  abundance  in  human  serum  [156].  GH  and  IGF-1  levels  decrease  during  normal  aging [155, 157].      Most  studies  demonstrated  decreased  levels  of  IGF-1  [158-161]  and  increased  levels  of  IGFBP-3  [156,  158,  162]  in   serum/plasma   of   RA   patients,   which   suggests   low   bioavailability  of  IGF-1.  Acute  starvation  in  RA  patients  (7  day  fasting  period)  led  to  a  further  decline  of  IGF-1  and  reduced  measures  of  inflammation  such  as  ESR,  CRP,  tender  joint  count  as  well  as  T-cell  counts.  Interestingly,  mitogen  activation  of  CD4+  T-cells  after  fasting  showed  increased  IL-4  production  in  vitro  [163].  These  data  link  nutrient-sensing  pathways  to  altered  T-cell  activation  in  RA.  How-ever,  Matsumoto  et  al.  showed  that  reduced  serum  levels  of  IGF-1 in RA did not correlate with clinical parameters of the disease  but  were  negatively  correlated  with  the  age  of  the  patients  [158].  Moreover,  several  studies  in  RA  patients  failed  to  detect  a  change  in  IGF-1  [164-166]  and  IGFBP-3  levels [164], and in addition, also observed decreased IGFB-3  levels  [160,  166].  In  SF,  both  IGF-1  and  IGFBP-3  levels  were  shown  to  be  increased  [167-169].  Thus,  the  picture  is  not unequivocal in RA. Similar  contrasting  data  were  obtained  for  levels  of  GH  [155].  Available  data  show  either  decreased  [166]  or  in-creased  [159,  164]  GH  levels  in  the  periphery  of  RA  patients. A study in newly diagnosed RA patients demonstrated impaired GH production and, similar to IGF-1, a role of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-1) in the further suppression of GH [170]. Components  of  the  nutrient-sensing  machinery,  found  to  be  important  in  aging,  such  as  Akt  (protein  kinase  B),  Foxo  and  mTOR,  have  been  implicated  in  the  local  inflammatory  process in RA and were studied mostly in joint-derived FLS [171-176]. In RA circulating T-cells, expression of nutrient-sensing proteins (AMPK and mTOR) was not different compared with controls [154]. In  summary,  alterations  of  nutrient-sensing  pathways  in  RA seem to be linked to the increased inflammatory status. 3.6. Mitochondrial Dysfunction Mitochondrial  dysfunction  is  a  feature  of  aging  and  may  be  caused  by  the  accumulation  of  somatic  mutations  within  the  mitochondrial  genome  (mtDNA),  and/or  by  respiratory  chain  dysfunction,  oxidation  of  mitochondrial  proteins  and  lipids.  Relevant  to  RA  pathogenesis  are  the  induction  of  ROS  and  mtDNA  mutations  in  synovium.  The  increase  of  mtDNA  mutations  were  found  only  when  compared  to  osteoarthritis  (OA)  control  tissue  [177],  but  not  when  compared   to   psoriatic   arthritis   (PsA)   tissue   [178].   Elevated   mtDNA  mutation  frequency  in  RA  was  independent  of  age.  MtDNA  mutations  positively  correlated  with  macroscopic  synovitis,  vascularity  and  with  synovial  fluid  TNF-  and  IFN-  levels.  As  with  other  alterations  observed  within  the  inflammatory  synovial  environment,  cause-effect  relation-ships  are  challenging  to  study.  Currently  available  data  sug-gest  involvement  of  TNF-,  and  TNF--associated  ROS  generation  in  induction  of  mtDNA  mutations  [177,  178].  Mitochondrial  dysfunction  as  a  result  of  compromised  me-tabolism induced by the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, has  been  shown  to  promote  ROS-  and  NF- B-dependent  induction  of  inflammatory  markers  by  normal  human  syno-viocytes [179].        Moreover,  cell-free  mtDNA  has  been  detected  in  RA  synovial  fluid  and  plasma  at  levels  significantly  higher  than  in  healthy  subjects  [180,  181],  likely  as  the  result  of  the  in-creased tissue damage in RA. A study by Collins et al. dem-onstrated  that  cell-free  oxidized  mtDNA  induces  develop-ment  of  arthritis  upon  its  intra-articular  injection  in  mice  [181].  Chronic  inflammation  was  found  to  affect  the  metabolic  competence  of  T-cells  in  RA.  Their  capacity  to  mobilize  aerobic  glycolysis  for  ATP  generation  was  significantly  re-duced [154]. 3.7. Cellular Senescence  Various  cell  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  stressors  can  induce  cellular  senescence.  P16ink4a  and  p53  play  major  roles  in  the  cellular  senescence  signaling  program  [182].  Both  proteins  are  central  in  the  regulation  of  cell  cycling  and  apoptosis.  It  has been proposed that the p53 and Rb pathways are respon-sible  for  the  stress-induced  growth  arrest,  while  permanent  expression  of  p16ink4a  and  p21WAF/CIP1 maintain  the  senes-cence state [183]. P53 was overexpressed in synovial tissues from  both  early  and  late-stage  RA  when  compared  to  OA  and  reactive  arthritis,  while  the  cells  in  normal  synovial  tis-sue  showed  significantly  less  p53  expression  [184].  Besides  wild-type p53,  also  mutated  p53  has  been  detected  in  RA  synovium [185]. Yamanishi et al. analysed p53  mutations  in  RA synovium and demonstrated preferential survival of FLS with  the  mutated  p53 allele.  Interestingly,  regions  with  high  p53 expression levels also contained high levels of IL-6 tran-scripts [185]. This can be explained by the loss of IL-6 sup-pression  dependent  on  the  wild-type  p53.  Induction  of  p53mutations  in  synovium  has  been  suggested  to  represent  an  event  secondary  to  chronic  oxidative  stress  and  the  continu-ous need for DNA repair [184-186].  Upregulation  of  p16  in  synovial  fibroblasts  leads  to  per-manent growth arrest, a feature associated with the senescent phenotype. The in  vitro upregulation of p16 in macrophages inhibited IL-6 expression [187]. Thus, local induction of p16 expression  may  have  beneficial  effects  and  has  been  pro-posed as a possible treatment strategy for RA [188, 189].       Interestingly,  downregulation  of  p53  and  other  proteins  from the DDR pathway in naive CD4+ T-cells has been implicated in T-cell senescence. Conversely, p16 and p53 were highly expressed in CD56+CD28- T-cells [13]. Another  marker  of  cellular  senescence  is  SA--gal.  SA--gal  was  found  to  be  endogenous  lysosomal   -gal  [190].  Although SA--gal was detected in OA cartilage, we are not aware of any studies reporting on SA--gal expression in RA synovium. 3.8. Stem Cell Exhaustion       Several  studies  suggest  that  alterations  at  the  level  of  hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) underlie premature aging of the peripheral T-cell pool in RA.       Cells  derived  from  the  bone  marrow  of  RA  patients  showed  less  effective  colony  formation  potency  when  compared  to  HC-derived  bone  marrow  cells  [191-193].  Further  studies   confirmed   the   reduced   proliferative   capacity   of   CD34+  HSC  from  RA  patients  [194-198].  HSC  in  RA  also  demonstrated an increased apoptosis rate. Concomitantly, the numbers of CD34+ stem cells were found to be decreased in the bone marrow [194-196] and PB in RA [197].        Colmegna      et  al.  [198]  demonstrated  a  dampened  ERK  signaling pathway in HSC of RA patients. ERK signaling is involved  in  the  growth,  differentiation  and  prevention  of  apoptosis  [199].  More  specifically,  alteration  in  RA  HSC  involved  decreased  interaction  between  K-Ras  and  B-Raf.  Ras-induced translocation of Raf to the cellular membrane is necessary  for  activation  of  the  downstream  events  of  the  Raf/MEK/ERK  pathway  [199].  Defects  in  K-Ras  and  B-Raf  co-localization  (and  consequently  reduced  level  of  activated  pERK)  have  been  linked  to  senescence-associated  impairment of the HSC proliferative response in RA.       Impaired  proliferative  capacity  of  HSC  in  RA  has  also  been associated with decreased telomere length. As HSC are the  precursors  of  T-cells,  accelerated  telomere  shortening  in  RA  HSC  may  underlie  the  previously  reported  premature  telomere attrition in RA T-cells [5, 200]. Interestingly, while naive CD4+ T-cells from RA patients were characterized by both  telomere  erosion  and  defective  telomerase  activity,  RA  HSC demonstrated an increased telomerase activity, suggest-ing activation of a compensatory pathway [200]. Yet, this did not  suffice  to  prevent  telomere  erosion  in  HSC  of  RA  patients carrying the RA-associated HLA-DRB1*04 alleles and led to the hypothesis of genetically-driven premature immunosenescence   in   RA   [5].   Senescence-associated   changes   within  HSC  of  RA  patients  were  independent  from  disease  duration or disease activity [197] and did not differ between treated  and  non-treated  patients  [194,  197].  However,  Pa-padaki et  al.  showed  that  increased  bone  marrow  levels  of  TNF- in RA patients is associated with increased apoptosis and a numerical decrease of CD34+ HSC [194].  3.9.   Altered   Intercellular   Communication   Leading   to   Inflammaging A low-grade inflammation develops with age, while spe-cific immunity wanes. This persistent inflammation has been termed  sterile  inflammation  due  to  the  lack  of  a  defined  pathogenic trigger, or inflammaging. Inflammaging has been associated with functional changes of senescent or terminally differentiated  cells  giving  rise  to  the  senescence-associated  secretory phenotype (SASP) [3].  Both  elderly  individuals  and  patients  with  RA  show  in-creased  systemic  levels  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  in-cluding,  among  others,  IL-6,  IL-8  and  TNF-  [201].  RA-derived  FLS,  which  undergo  replicative  senescence  induced  by  serial  passage,  produce  significantly  more  IL-6,  IL-8,  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  and  prostaglan-din  E2  (PGE2)  in  response  to  IL-1,  when  compared  to  early-passage  FLS  [202].  Analysis  of  the  molecular  mecha-nisms  underlying  SASP  revealed  a  critical  role  of  persistent  DNA damage response involving increased levels of proteins from the ATM pathway (ATM, NBS1, CHK2) [203, 204]. In contrast,   activated   p53   may   suppress   the   senescence-associated cytokine (IL-6, IL-8) secretion, while loss of p53 may  amplify  the  SASP  [203-205].  Persistent  DNA  damage  has  also  been  suggested  as  an  underlying  factor  of  T-cell  replicative  senescence  in  RA.  Thus,  despite  the  fact  that  SASP-inducing ATM and NSB1 were found to be decreased in  RA  T-cells  [77],  other  proteins  involved  in  the  persistent  DDR  could  contribute  to  SASP  in  the  context  of  RA.  One  candidate  may  involve  p53  which  was  found  decreased  in  RA-derived naive CD4+ T-cells [77].        In  conclusion,  multiple  hallmarks  of  aging  have  been  identified  in  early  and/or  late  stage  RA  patients  and  are  summarized in Table 1.  4.  EFFECTS  OF  RA  TREATMENT  ON  THE  AGED  PROFILE IN RA       Biological  hallmarks  of  aging  seem  to  converge  in  the  pre-aged  phenotype  as  seen  in  RA  (Table  and  Figure).  Yet,  this  premature  aging  may  be  inflammation-driven.  To  gain  further  insight  in  cause  and  consequence,  we  reviewed  the  effects  of  anti-inflammatory  treatment  on  the  pre-aged  phe-notype  in  RA  patients.  Several  researchers  addressed  the  issue  of  reversibility  of  premature  T-cell  aging  upon  treat-ment in RA patients. First, in vitro studies demonstrated that chronic  TNF-  stimulation-induced  CD28  loss  by  T-cells  was  partly  restored  by  TNF-  inhibition  [210,  211].  Effects  of  TNF-  blockade  on  the  number  of  CD28-  T-cells  in  pa-tients,  however,  are  inconclusive.  While  some  studies  re-ported   on   a   reduction   of   the   number   of   circulating   CD4+CD28-  T-cells  [22,  24],  others  did  not  observe  any  change  [37].  Also,  anti-TNF-  treatment  did  not  affect  the  CMV-specific  IFN-  response  of  CD4+CD28-  T-cells  [37].  The absolute number of CD4+CD28- T-cells was not differ-ent between RA patients receiving abatacept (CTLA-4Ig) or DMARDs    [212].    Others    demonstrated    reduction    of    CD8+CD28-  and  late-stage  CD8  effector  memory,  but  not  CD4+CD28-  T-cells  after  48  weeks  of  abatacept  treatment.  The  decreases  of  CD28-  cells  among  both  CD4+  and  CD8+  T  lymphocyte  populations  after  abatacept  therapy  were  correlated    with    the    clinical    response    as    measured    by    DAS28/CRP  [213].  Interestingly,  the  absolute  numbers  of ","CD28-  T-cells  (before  treatment)  were  found  to  predict  the  response to abatacept [214].  More importantly, beneficial effects of treatment on pre-mature  HSC  aging,  a  putative  underlying  cause  of  acceler-ated T-cell senescence in RA, were reported. The bone mar-row  niche  of  RA  patients  showed  decreased  apoptosis  rates  of  the  CD34+  fraction,  increased  cell  growth  potential  (as-sessed  by  the  colony  formation  assay)  and  an  increased  fre-quency of CD34+ cells after anti-TNF- treatment [194, 195, 209].  Besides  the  positive  effect  on  the  number  of  HSC,  blocking  of  TNF-  also  resulted  in  an  increase  in  the  levels  of  recent  thymic  emigrants,  defined  as  CD31+CD4+  T-cells  [209].  Parameters  of  bone  marrow  function  were  not  differ-ent between RA patients who were or were not on concomi-tant  MTX  [196],  suggesting  that  TNF--  but  not  MTX-mediated suppression of inflammation, is important for reju-venation of the HSC pool in RA.       Telomere   erosion   and   reduced   telomerase   activity   in   CD4+ T-cells were not affected by treatment of RA patients with  MTX  or  prednisone  [91,  200].  Similarly,  accelerated  telomere  erosion  in  HSC  was  seen  in  both  treated  and  not  (yet)  treated  RA  patients  in  cross-sectional  analyses  only  [197].  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  the  influence  of  anti-TNF-  agents  on  telomere  length  and  telomerase  activity  in  RA  has  not  yet  been  addressed.  Neutralization  of  TNF-  in vitro was associated with up regulation of telomerase activity in CD8+ T-cells [215].       Effects  of  DMARD  treatment  on  cellular  senescence,  markers  of  DNA  damage  and  epigenetic  alterations  relevant  to RA were studied only in cell line models. In vitro-induced senescence in human fibroblast and cancer cell lines demon-strated  a  glucocorticoid  (GC)-mediated  reduction  of  SASP,  such as reduced IL-6 and IL-8 expression. GC did not affect persistent  DNA  damage,  the  underlying  cause  of  SASP,  nor  growth arrest or expression of SA--gal [216].        Longitudinal  clinical  studies  demonstrated  reduction  of  the      markers      of      oxidative      stress,      including      8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine  upon  treatment  with  MTX  or  anti-TNF-  agents.  These  findings  suggest  that  DMARD  treat-ment  reduces  ROS-induced  DNA  damage  [206,  207,  217].  Also  mtDNA  mutations  frequency,  regarded  as  a  marker  of  mitochondrial  dysfunction,  was  significantly  lower  in  pa-tients  with  low  disease  activity  (DAS28  <  3.2)  after  TNF-  blocking therapy [178].  Studies  investigating  effects  of  anti-TNF-  treatment  in  RA  patients  on  the  activity  of  HAT  and  HDAC,  regulating  the  acetylation  status  of  histones,  yielded  contradictory  re-sults. HDAC activity, significantly higher in RA at baseline, did  not  change  upon  etanercept  treatment  [112].  Others  showed an increase in HAT and a decrease in HDAC activity in a group of RA patients receiving various TNF- inhibitors and  increase  of  both  HAT  and  HDAC  upon  RTX  treatment  [208]. Contradictory results were attributed to the use of dif-ferent biologicals in these studies. Thus, the combined evidence suggests that inflammation involving  TNF-,  drives  premature  HSC  aging,  a  putative  cause  of  accelerated  T-cell  senescence  in  RA.  To  further  substantiate  the  notion  of  reversibility  of  the  senescent  phe-notype by TNF- blocking agents or DMARDs, longitudinal clinical  studies  in  well-defined  patient  cohorts  before  and  after treatment are needed to clarify this issue. 5.  PREMATURE  AGING  IN  RA:  CAUSE  OR  CONSE-QUENCE?  It has been suggested that premature aging of the immune system may be causal to RA. Telomere shortening of CD4+ T-cells  was  accelerated  in  RA  patients  carrying  the  RA-associated HLA-DRB1*04 alleles, which led to the hypothe-sis  of  genetically-driven  premature  immunosenescence  in  RA  [5].  However,  in  light  of  more  recent  discoveries,  we  suggest  that  the  causes  of  premature  senescence  in  RA  may  be  inflammation-driven.  New  knowledge  of  how  environ-mental  factors  interact  with  susceptibility  genes  and  the  im-mune   system   in   the   development   of   seropositive   RA   (ACPA+  and/or  RF+)  has  emerged.  ACPA  were  found  to  develop  more  profoundly  in  individuals  carrying  the  RA-associated HLA-DRB1 shared epitope-containing alleles and can  be  detected  years  before  symptoms  become  manifest  [218].  Presence  of  ACPA  and  RF  in  pre-RA  patients  was  associated  with  elevated  levels  of  pro-inflammatory  cytoki-nes  [219,  220].  ACPA  and/or  RF  may  trigger  the  inflamma-tory  response  via  an  FcR-mediated  mechanism  [221,  222].  Thus,  the  autoantibody-mediated  inflammatory  state,  that  precedes  RA  development  by  many  years,  may  be  responsi-ble for premature immunosenescence in RA. 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES In order to evaluate the notion that premature immunose-nescence in RA is inflammation-driven, we propose to study immunosenescence  features  in  prospective,  longitudinal  co-hort  studies.  Inclusion  of  individuals  who  are  at  risk  for  fu-ture RA development (not yet receiving DMARD treatment) would  allow  to  assess  the  association  between  inflammatory  markers  and  the  immunonesenescent  phenotype  in  the  pre-clinical phase of RA, at disease onset and beyond. Cohorts to be used to assess the preclinical alterations putatively impli-cated in RA pathogenesis are seropositive arthralgia patients (SAP)   and   patients   with   early,   undifferentiated   arthritis   (UA).  Both  UA  and  SAP  have  30%  chance  of  progressing  towards classifiable RA [223, 224]. Furthermore, we propose to  study  immunosenescence  features  in  late  onset  seropositive and seronegative RA. As  normal  aging  is  associated  with  an  overall  decline  of  immune  function,  it  will  be  important  to  compare  healthy  age-matched  controls,  excluding  elderly  subjects  with  co-morbidities.  Assessment  of  immunosenescence  parameters  together with disease activity and pro-inflammatory markers at the preclinical stage and at the switch to clinical synovitis, are  expected  to  provide  insight  into  the  mechanisms  of  their  mutual regulation.CONFLICT OF INTEREST The  authors  confirm  that  this  article  content  has  no  conflict of interest.

Effect of advanced age and/or systemic medical conditions on dental implant survival: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Martin Schimmel, Murali Srinivasan, Gerald McKenna, Frauke Müller","Objectives:  This   review evaluated implant survival in  geriatric patients (≥75 years) and/or the impact of systemic medical conditions.Materials and Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed to identify studies reporting on geriatric subjects with dental implants and on implant patients who had any of the seven most common systemic conditions among geriatric patients. Meta‐analyses were performed on the postloading implant survival rates. The impact  of  systemic  medical  conditions  and  their  respective  treatment  was  qualitatively analyzed.Results: A total of 6,893 studies were identified; of those, 60 studies were included. The   fixed‐effects model    revealed an  overall implant survival of  97.3%    (95%    CI:   94.3, 98.7;    studies = 7) and   96.1%     (95%    CI:   87.3,    98.9;    studies = 3), for   1  and   5 years, respectively. In patients with cardiovascular disease, implant survival may be similar or higher compared to healthy patients. High implant survival rates were reported for patients with Parkinson’s disease or diabetes mellitus type II. In patients with cancer, implant survival is negatively affected, namely by radiotherapy. Patients with bone metastases  receiving  high‐dose  antiresorptive  therapy  (ART)  carry  a  high  risk  for  complications after implant surgery. Implant survival was reported to be high in patients receiving low‐dose ART for treatment of osteoporosis. No evidence was found on implant survival in patients with dementia, respiratory diseases, liver cirrhosis, or osteoarthritis.Conclusions: Implant prostheses in geriatric subjects are a predictable treatment option with a very high rate of implant survival. The functional and psychosocial benefits  of  such  intervention  should  outweigh  the  associated  risks  to  common  medical  conditions.KEYWORDS aging, Alzheimer's disease, bisphosphonates, cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis of the liver, dementia, dental implants, depression, diabetes mellitus, geriatric, hypertensive heart disease, hyposalivation, ischemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, medication‐related osteonecrosis of the jaw, meta‐analysis, neurocognitive impairment, osteoarthritis, Parkinson's disease, radiotherapy, respiratory diseases, stroke, systematic review","1 | INTRODUCTION Current  demographic  trends  suggest  that  tooth  loss  now  occurs  in  later life, and an increased number of patients will require tooth replacements at  an  advanced age   (Hugoson et al.,    2005;    Stock,    Jurges, Shen, Bozorgmehr & Listl, 2015). In Germany and Switzerland, more than    90%    of  patients aged    ≥75 years have    a  fixed    and/or removable dental  prosthesis,  and  this  age  group  has  an  increasing  number  of  implant restorations, compared to 20 years ago (Jordan & Micheelis, 2016;  Schneider,  Zemp  &  Zitzmann,  2017).  This  trend  was  likewise  reported  in  the  Department  of  Oral  Surgery  and  Stomatology  at  the University of Bern, School of Dental Medicine, where there is a marked increase since the year 2000 in implant surgeries in the age cohort of  ≥70 years (Schimmel, Müller, Suter    &  Buser,    2017).    It  has   to be borne in mind that the prevalence of systemic medical conditions and frailty increase with age, and this may influence implant survival.Today’s  aged  generation  present  new  challenges  in  the  field  of  implant  dentistry.  Old  and  very  old  patients,  terms  that  are  often  used   when  referring to  persons 75  years   or  older,    often   present with  functional  dependency,  multimorbidity,  and  frailty.  This  may  or  may  not  present  a  risk  for  implant  placement,  maintenance,  and  ultimately survival.The world health report on aging published by the World Health Organization  (WHO)  lists  the  most  common  chronic  conditions  in  elders: cardiovascular disease (CVD) (including ischemic heart disease,  stroke,  and  hypertensive  heart  disease),  cancer,  respiratory  diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, and lower respiratory  infections),  diabetes  mellitus,  cirrhosis  of  the  liver,  osteoarthritis, and conditions that involve neurocognitive impairment (unipolar  depression,  Alzheimer’s  disease,  and  other  dementias)  (WHO, 2015).Additional risks may arise from the treatment of these medical conditions, including negative side effects. Polypharmacy as well as  radiotherapy  directed  toward  the  salivary  glands  may  cause  symptoms  of  dry  mouth.  High‐dose  bisphosphonates  prescribed  for  the  treatment  of  cancer  with  bone  metastases  may  present  a  risk  for  necrosis  of  the  jaw.  Lower  dose  bisphosphonates  are  prescribed  for  the  treatment  of  osteoporosis,  although  it  is  not  listed among the seven most prevalent chronic systemic diseases in elders.Any  of  these  conditions  or  treatments  might  be  considered  by  the patient or clinician as absolute or relative contraindication for implant surgery/therapy. Risks may be related to the surgical procedure itself, osseointegration, soft tissue response, as well as the long‐term survival of the implant (Bartold, Ivanovski & Darby, 2016; Bornstein, Cionca & Mombelli, 2009). Another pathway of failure may be more indirect,  via  neglected  oral  hygiene  and  improper  implant  maintenance. For example, patients with dementia are known to have lower motivation to perform regular and meticulous oral hygiene, in addition  to  diminished  cognitive  and  manual  skills  to  perform  the  adequate procedures (Brändli, 2012). Reduced motor skills are also well documented for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (Lawrence et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2002) or stroke (Schimmel et al., 2011).Implant  success  and  survival  are  well  documented  for  younger  age   cohorts (Schimmel, Srinivasan, Herrmann &  Müller, 2014),     but little is known about the effect of age on osseointegration and long‐term   implant survival (Srinivasan, Meyer,     Mombelli & Müller,     2016).    In  a  comprehensive  review  of  biological,  clinical,  and  sociological  considerations,  Bartold  et  al.  (2016)  acknowledge  the  influence  of  physiological  aging  on  wound  healing.  However,  the  complex  process  that  leads  to  osseointegration  of  titanium  implants  as  well  as  the  accompanying  inflammatory  response  has  been  mainly  studied  in  animals  (Bartold  et  al.,  2016).  Bornstein  et  al.  reviewed  and  discussed the available evidence in relation to medical conditions that may  influence  early  and  late  implant  failure  (Bornstein,  Cionca  &  Mombelli, 2015;    Bornstein et al.,    2009)    and   found    a  low   level    of  evidence  that  indicates  absolute  or  relative  contraindications  for  implant surgery. Furthermore, little is known about the reactions of the peri‐implant tissues to poor oral hygiene in geriatric patients (Holm‐Pedersen, Agerbaek & Theilade, 1975; Meyer et al., 2017).In the scope of this review, geriatric patients were defined as patients    with   an  age   of  75  years   and   above. The   aim  of  this   systematic review was to screen and pool the available evidence to establish: 1. The  dental  implant  survival  rate  in  geriatric  patients. 2. The potential impacts of the most common systemic medical conditions (WHO, 2015) and their treatments on implant survival.The  focused  question  set  for  this  systematic  review  was  “In  patients  undergoing  dental  implant  therapy,  what  is  the  effect  of  advanced    age  (≥75   years)    and/or   common systemic medical conditions on the implant survival, biological complication, and technical complication rates?”2 | MATERIAL AND METHODS 2.1 | Protocol and registration This  systematic  review  and  meta‐analysis  were  conducted  and  reported according to  the   PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al.,    2015). The  review  protocol  was  registered  with  PROSPERO:  International  prospective   register   of   systematic   reviews   (PROSPERO   2016:   CRD420160 49617).2.2 | Eligibility criteria All   human studies reporting on  geriatric individuals (≥75 years) with dental implants that satisfied the listed predefined inclusion criteria (Table  1)  were  included  in  the  first  part  of  this  systematic  review,  which  analyzed  implant  survival.  Therefore,  outcomes  in  healthy  aged people were also sought.For the second part of this search, no age limit was applied, as a preliminary screening of the literature did not identify any studies in relation to the most common medical conditions in the elderly (WHO, 2015) if the exclusion criteria included those aged 75 years or older.  2.3 | Information sources Three  electronic  databases  were  searched:  MEDLINE  (PubMed),  EMBASE,  and  CENTRAL.  Hand  searches  of  dental  journals  were  performed  for  records  that  were  not  accessible  electronically  or  for  those  records  without  an  electronic  abstract  available.  Further  searches resulting from reference cross‐checks were performed to identify  studies  that  were  not  discovered  online.  Further  attempts  to  maximize  the  pool  of  relevant  studies  and  avoid  any  erroneous  exclusion  involved  posting  queries  on  research  community  web‐sites  (https://www.researchgate.net/)  and,  personal  communications sent to selected authors. The final update for all the electronic searches was performed on June 9, 2017.2.4 | Search strategy The search strategy was designed and set up by two experts in database searches (Table 1). An initial electronic search was performed by a single reviewer (MS). Then the search was repeated by a second reviewer (GMK) to confirm the number of discovered articles by the search  strategy.  The  search  terms  employed  were  either  medical  subject headings (MeSH) terms or keywords classified under general (all  fields)  category.  The  search  terms  were  then  combined  with  an  “OR,” and PICO categories were combined using “AND” to create a final logic search query (Supporting Information Table ).2.5 | Study selectionAll  relevant  studies  were  included  in  this  review,  if  they  fulfilled  the inclusion criteria. A title and abstract screening was performed by  two  investigators  independently  (MS  and  GMK).  A  final  list  of  studies was put forth for full‐text analysis and data extraction, only after a mutual agreement between the two investigators; disagreements, if any, were resolved by means of a consensus discussion. In cases of identified studies reporting on the same cohort at different time points, only the most recent publication was included in the review.2.6 | Data collection process The  investigators  (MS  and  GMK)  extracted  data  from  the  included  studies  independently  and  were  reciprocally  blinded.  During  data  extraction,  for  any  uncertainty  involving  the  extracted  variable,  a  consensus was always reached by both investigators before finalizing the extracted data. In cases of significant doubts, corresponding authors were contacted for confirmation of the extracted information. The data items extracted from the included studies are specified in Tables 2‒9.2.7 | Missing data Information was requested by email from the corresponding authors of  included  studies  for  missing  or  unclear  data.  In  case  of  a  nonresponse,  email  reminders  were  sent.  A  non response  from  the  corresponding author ultimately resulted in the exclusion of the study from the review.2.8 | Risk of bias and quality assessment of the included studies The   Cochrane   collaboration’s   tool   and   the   Newcastle‐Ottawa   scales  were  used  for  the  assessment  of  the  risk  of  bias  and  quality  assessment of the included RCTs and prospective cohort/case–control studies, respectively (Higgins & Green, 2011; Wells et al., 2014).2.9 | Summary measures 2.9.1 | Primary outcome measure The primary outcome measure in this review was calculated implant survival based on the reported number of implants placed and failed. This  calculation  provided  the  event  rate  in  the  first  year  postload‐ing. Implants in dropout patients and in those patients not available for  follow‐up  were  censored.  Implant  survival  rate  was  assessed  in  the  context  of  patient  age  and  medical  status.  Implant  failure  has  been defined as loss or removal of implant for any reason, and the timing of the failure has been described for the purpose of this review  as  either  early,  delayed,  or  late  (ten  Bruggenkate,  Asikainen,  Foitzik, Krekeler & Sutter, 1998). The loading protocols described in this review have been adopted as per the definitions of a previously published review (Schimmel et al., 2014).2.9.2 | Secondary and tertiary outcome measures Mean  annual  peri‐implant  marginal  bone  loss  (PI‐MBL),  biological  complications and any associated technical and/or mechanical complications were set as secondary and tertiary outcome parameters.2.10 | Synthesis of resultsKappa (κ) statistics were calculated to confirm the intern investigator agreement for the various extracted parameters. A meta‐analysis was performed on the included prospective studies for implant survival rates    at  1  and   5 years postloading. The   weighted means across     the studies were calculated using a fixed‐effects model. Heterogeneity across the included studies was assessed using the I‐squared statistics (I2 statistics). For the purpose of the meta‐analyses, case reports or  case  series  reporting  on  less  than  10  patients  were  excluded  as  the inclusion of individual participant data (IPD) would require a different     statistical approach (Stewart et al.,    2015).     The   meta‐analysis was  performed  using  a  meta‐analysis  software  (CMA,  version  3.0;  Biostat, Englewood, NJ,   USA),    with    confidence intervals set   to  95% (95%  CI).2.11 | Risk of publication bias and additional analyses The risk of publication bias was explored across the included studies  using  a  funnel  plot  (Sterne  &  Egger,  2001).  PI‐MBL,  biological  complications,   technical/mechanical   complications,   and   implant   survival related to the medical status of the patients were reported descriptively.3 | RESULTS 3.1 | Study selection The search queries identified a total of 6,893 studies from the three electronic  databases.  After  an  initial  sweep  to  eliminate  duplicates  and articles not relevant to the focus question followed by title and abstract  screening,  a  combined  total  of  680  studies  were  selected  for full‐text analysis. Initially, 46 relevant articles were shortlisted for inclusion  in  the  review.  After  subsequent  hand  searches,  reference  cross‐checks,  and  information  from  other  sources  and  authors,  an  additional  16  articles  were  identified.  Four  authors  provided  novel  sub analyses from their published cohorts to report only on patients aged    75 years or  older    (Antoun, Karouni, Abitbol, Zouiten &  Jemt,    2017;  Bressan  &  Lops,  2014;  Hoeksema,  Visser,  Raghoebar,  Vissink  & Meijer, 2016; Ormianer & Palti, 2006). A final total of 62 relevant articles were included in the review for data extraction. The flow of the  entire  search  and  the  article  identification  process  is  shown  in  Figure 1.  3.2 | Study characteristics 3.2.1 | Studies included for meta‐analysis From the included final list of 62 publications, seven prospective studies reported exclusively on  geriatric cohorts aged   ≥75 years (Becker, Hujoel,     Becker & Wohrle, 2016; Bressan & Lops, 2014; Cakarer, Can, Yaltirik & Keskin,  2011;  de  Carvalho,  de  Carvalho  &  Consani,  2013;  Hoeksema  et al.,    2016;    Maniewicz Wins    et al.,    2017;    Müller     et al.,    2015)    (Table 2).Among    these,    there    was   one   RCT   (Müller et  al.,  2015),    one   prospective controlled  clinical  trial  (Hoeksema  et  al.,  2016),  and  five  prospective  case  series  (Becker  et  al.,  2016;  Bressan  &  Lops,  2014;  Cakarer  et  al.,  2011;  de  Carvalho  et  al.,  2013;  Maniewicz  Wins  et  al.,  2017).  These  three prospective studies were included in the meta‐analysis for 1‐year postloading implant survival in  a  geriatric population, aged    75 years or  older;  while  six  of  these  studies  also  provided  information  for  inclusion   in  the   meta‐analysis for   the   5 year    postloading implant survival (de  Carvalho et al., 2013; Maniewicz Wins et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2015).3.2.2 | Studies included for descriptive analysis The   remaining 53   studies reported on   cohorts with    the   most    common systemic medical conditions or their respective treatment and their effect on implant survival. The analyses included both, the individual  medical  conditions  and  their  treatment  effects.  Although  these  studies  report  on  all‐age  cohorts,  they  were  still  included  in  this  review  because  no  studies  were  identified  for  cohorts  aged  75 years and over.3.3 | Synthesis of results 3.3.1 | Inter‐investigator agreement The calculated κ‐range was 0.637–1.000, and 0.800–1.000, for the different stages of the search process, and the various parameters of the extracted data, respectively, which is defined as good to almost perfect reliability between the two independent investigators (MS and GMK).3.3.2 | Meta‐analysis of the included studies: Implant survival in geriatric subjects A meta‐analysis was performed for the postloading implant survival rates  calculated  for  observation  periods  at  1  year  (Becker  et  al.,  2016; Bressan & Lops, 2014; Cakarer et al., 2011; de Carvalho et al., 2013;    Hoeksema et al.,    2016;    Maniewicz et al.,    2017;    Müller et al., 2015).     The   fixed‐effects model     revealed an  overall 1‐year     postload‐ing   implant survival of  96.7%     (95%    CI:   94.3,    98.7; I2 = 0.00%; n = 7 studies; Figure 2). Three    studies provided information for   a  5‐year meta‐analysis  and  revealed  an  overall  postloading  implant  survival  of  96.1%    (95%    CI:  87.3,    98.9; I2 =   0.00%, Figure 3) (de Carvalho et al., 2013;    Maniewicz et al.,    2017;    Müller et al.,    2015).     According to  the funnel  plot  analysis,  a  possible  publication  bias  across  the  studies  included in the meta‐analysis was explored and ruled out (Figure 4). 3.3.3 | Calculated annual peri‐implant bone loss The calculated annual peri‐implant bone loss was reported to range from    0.1 mm annually (Becker et al.,    2016)    to  0.51 mm during the first year postloading (Hoeksema et al., 2016) for geriatric subjects aged ≥75 years (Table 3).3.4 | Medical conditions and their treatment 3.4.1 | Cardiovascular disease (including ischemic heart disease, stroke, hypertensive heart disease)Implant  survival  in  relation  to  CVD  or  associated  treatment  was  reported  in  two  studies  (Table  4).  In  particular,  Wu  et  al.  (2016)  reported a higher survival rate of implants in patients treated with antihypertensive therapy. In contrast, Alsaadi, Quirynen, Komarek and van  Steenberghe  (2008)  did  not  find  an  influence  of  hypertensive  heart disease on implant survival.3.4.2 | Cancer Radiotherapy The effects of radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer in the head and  neck  region  on  implant  survival  were  included  in  this  systematic review. Seventeen studies were identified which met the inclusion   and   exclusion criteria (Table 5) (Arcuri, Fridrich, Funk,    Tabor    & LaVelle,  1997;  Bodard  et  al.,  2011;  Buddula  et  al.,  2012;  Cuesta‐Gil  et  al.,  2009;  Eckert,  Desjardins,  Keller  &  Tolman,  1996;  Ernst  et  al.,  2016;  Fenlon  et  al.,  2012;  Gander,  Studer,  Studer,  Gratz  &  Bredell,  2014;  Heberer,  Kilic,  Hossamo,  Raguse  &  Nelson,  2011;  Hessling  et al.,    2015;     Korfage et al.,    2014;     Linsen, Martini &  Stark,     2012; Mancha  de  la  Plata  et  al.,  2012;  Mericske‐Stern,  Perren  &  Raveh,  1999;     Pompa et al.,    2015;     Sammartino, Marenzi, Cioffi, Tete    & Mortellaro, 2011). Most of the studies reported on implants placed after  radiotherapy  (Arcuri  et  al.,  1997;  Bodard  et  al.,  2011;  Ernst  et al., 2016; Gander et al., 2014; Heberer et al., 2011; Hessling et al., 2015;    Korfage et al.,    2014;    Linsen et al.,    2012;    Mancha de   la  Plata et al.,    2012;    Pompa et al.,    2015;    Sammartino et al.,    2011).     Only    two studies  also  included  patients  with  implants  placed  prior  to  radiotherapy (Hessling et al., 2015; Mericske‐Stern et al., 1999).Survival rates    were    reported to  range    between 57.1%     for   immediately placed implants into vascularized grafts with subsequent radiotherapy (Fenlon et al., 2012) and 97.9% (Heberer et al., 2011).Most investigators reported a time lapse between radiotherapy and implant placement of more than 12 months; however, some utilized a shorter delay (Ernst et al., 2016; Heberer et al., 2011; Korfage et al., 2014; Sammartino et al., 2011).Antiresorptive therapy Patients with bone metastases, including breast and prostate cancer or those suffering from multiple myeloma often receive high‐dose intravenous antiresorptive therapy (ART) that may be associated with medication‐related  osteonecrosis  of  the  jaw  (MRONJ)  (Jacobsen  et al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2014). A recent review supports the statement  that  dental  implant  treatment  is  contraindicated  in  these  patients  because  of  the  greatly  increased  risk  of  MRONJ  (Lazarovici  et al., 2010).In  a  different  context,  ART  is  a  very  common  treatment  for  osteoporosis.  The  current  systematic  search  identified  14  articles  that  provided  information  about  the  implant  survival  in  patients  treated  with  ART  for  osteoporosis  and  osteopenia  (Table  6)  (Bell  &  Bell,  2008;  Fugazzotto,  Lightfoot,  Jaffin  &  Kumar,  2007;  Goss,  Bartold,  Sambrook  &  Hawker,  2010;  Grant,  Amenedo,  Freeman  &  Kraut,  2008;  Griffiths,  2012;  Jacobsen  et  al.,  2013;  Koka,  Babu  &  Norell, 2010; Kwon et al., 2014; Lopez‐Cedrun et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2010; Memon, Weltman & Katancik, 2012; Shabestari et al., 2010; Siebert, Jurkovic, Statelova &  Strecha, 2015; Tallarico,Canullo,  Xhanari  &  Meloni,  2016;  Zahid,  Wang  &  Cohen,  2011).  Another two articles reported on mixed indications, including malignancies  (Jacobsen  et  al.,  2013;  Kwon  et  al.,  2014).  In  studies  of  osteoporotic patients managed with ART, reported implant survival rates were predominately high. The prevalence of MRONJ in these patient cohorts was rarely specified (Fugazzotto et al., 2007; Goss et  al.,  2010;  Griffiths,  2012;  Shabestari  et  al.,  2010;  Siebert  et  al.,  2015; Zahid et al., 2011).Hyposalivation The effect of hyposalivation on implant survival was only reported for  patients  with  Sjögren’s  syndrome,  rather  than  in  cancer  patients  with  radiotherapy  (Table  7)  (de  Mendonca  Invernici  et  al.,  2014;  Korfage  et  al.,  2016;  Oczakir,  Balmer  &  Mericske‐Stern,  2005;     Spinato,  Soardi     &  Zane,     2010;     Weinlander,  Krennmair  & Piehslinger,  2010).  Survival  rates  were  reported  to  be  100%  (de  Mendonca Invernici et al.,    2014;    Oczakir et al.,    2005;    Spinato et al.,    2010; Weinlander et al., 2010), with the exception of a recent comparative study, which reported a small number of early implant failures (Korfage et al., 2016).3.4.3 | Respiratory diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and lower respiratory infections)No  articles  reporting  on  implant  survival  in  patients  with  COPD  or  other respiratory diseases were identified in the search.3.4.4 | Diabetes mellitus A  number  of  recent  prospective  cohort  studies  reported  on  the  survival of implants in adult patients with diabetes mellitus, mainly Type 2 (Table 8) (Aguilar‐Salvatierra et al., 2016; Alsaadi et al., 2008; Dowell, Oates     &  Robinson, 2007;     Erdogan et al.,    2015;     Eskow & Oates,  2017;  Oates  et  al.,  2014;  Peled,  Ardekian,  Tagger‐Green,  Gutmacher  &  Machtei,  2003).  Calculated  survival  rates  were  reported to range from 86.3% (24‐month observation period) (Aguilar‐Salvatierra  et  al.,  2016)  to  100%  (12  months)  (Oates  et  al.,  2014).  Poor control (HbA1c ≥ 8.0%) may have an influence. 3.4.5 | Cirrhosis of the liverNo articles reporting on implant survival in patients with cirrhosis of the liver were identified by the search criteria.3.4.6 | Osteoarthritis No  articles  reporting  on  implant  survival  in  patients  with  osteoarthritis were discovered by the search criteria.3.4.7 | Neurocognitive impairment (unipolar depression, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and Parkinson's disease)The  search  revealed  no  data  regarding  implant  survival  in  patients  with  Alzheimer’s  disease  or  other  forms  of  dementia.  Studies  addressing  other  forms  of  neurocognitive  impairment  and  implant  survival are listed in Table 9 (Chu, Deng, Siu & Chow, 2004; Deniz, Kokat & Noyan, 2011; Ekfeldt, Zellmer & Carlsson, 2013; Heckmann, Heckmann  &  Weber,  2000;  Jackowski  et  al.,  2001;  Packer,  Nikitin,  Coward, Davis & Fiske, 2009; Wu et al., 2014). One study reported higher  implant  failure  rates  in  patients  taking  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  for  depression  compared  to  nonusers  of  SSRIs  (Wu et al., 2014). Case reports and case series with a limited number  of  participants  reported  on  patients  with  Parkinson’s  disease  with calculated survival rates ranging between 82.1% (Packer et al., 2009) and 100% (Chu et al., 2004; Heckmann et al., 2000).4 | DISCUSSION 4.1 | Principal findings This review identified high implant survival rates in geriatric patients aged    75 years and   older.    The   1  and   5‐year     implant survival rates    are similar to those reported in younger cohorts (Al‐Nawas et al., 2012; Müller et al.,    2015), irrespective of  the   clinical indications or  load‐ing  protocol  (Benic,  Mir‐Mari  &  Hammerle,  2014;  Papaspyridakos,  Chen, Chuang & Weber, 2014; Schimmel et al., 2014; Schrott, Riggi‐Heiniger,  Maruo  &  Gallucci,  2014).  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  1‐year  survival  rates  reflect  implants  failing  to  osseointegrate,  and  therefore, it could be suggested that advanced age does not seem to negatively affect osseointegration.Clinical decision‐making should take into consideration the oral and  systemic  health  of  every  patient  with  comorbidities  in  form  of  an  individualized  risk  assessment  comprising  a  close  collaboration  with medical specialists and the family doctor. Implant placement in oncologic patients must be performed with caution and, if at all, an adequate  refractory  period  post radiotherapy  (>12  months)  should  be  respected.  Individualized  treatment  planning  including  assessment of radiation protocol must be carefully tailored and should be performed in a specialist setting; however, the risk of osteonecrosis cannot  be  ruled  out.  Implant  placement  in  patients  receiving  high‐dose ART is contraindicated.  Although ranking among the most common diseases in geriatric  patients,  there  is  no  evidence  on  implant  dentistry  on  conditions including cirrhosis of the liver, osteoarthritis, or respiratory diseases  and  sparse  knowledge  on  patients  with  neurocognitive  impairment and their respective treatments. This may constitute a potential risk for implant surgery, osseointegration and implant survival; for example, the use of glucocorticoids might induce osteoporosis and thus, influence bone healing (Krennmair, Seemann &  Piehslinger,  2010).  With  multiple  chronic  conditions  present,  their  effect  on  implant  treatment  becomes  complex  and  poorly  understood.4.1.1 | Cardiovascular disease The main concern in patients with CVD may be related to the general risk in performing invasive surgery because of prescribed anticoagulants or changes in blood pressure due to vasoconstrictor containing local anaesthetics.Interestingly,  the  current  review  identified  one  study  that  reported  the  positive  impact  of  antihypertensive  drugs  on  implant  survival (Wu et al., 2016). The authors hypothesize that this may be related to the positive effect of such drugs including beta‐blockers, thiazide  diuretics,  ACE  inhibitors,  and  ARBs  on  bone  metabolism,  which constitutes an interesting field for further research.4.1.2 | Radiotherapy The use of head and neck radiotherapy has been associated with a reduced  survival  rate  of  implants.  In  many  cases,  implants  may  be  the  only  possibility  of  a  prosthetic  restoration,  aiming  for  the  patient’s  functional  rehabilitation,  social  reintegration  and  psychological well‐being (Müller, Schadler, Wahlmann &  Newton, 2004). A  recent  review  suggests  that  recently  improved  protocols  of  administering  therapeutic  radiation  doses  carry  less  risk  for  implant  failure  and  MRONJ,  compared  to  traditional  protocols  (Schiegnitz,  Al‐Nawas, Kammerer & Grotz, 2014).4.1.3 | Antiresorptive therapy and osteoporosis Antiresorptive therapy with agents that have long‐lasting effects on bone  metabolism  can  also  be  a  major  obstacle  for  implant  surgery.  Patients  with  Cancer  with  bone  metastases  (e.g.,  from  breast  or  prostate cancer) or with multiple myeloma often receive high‐dose intravenous ART. Dental implant treatment is often contraindicated in these patients because of the strongly increased risk of MRONJ (Lazarovici et al., 2010).Osteoporosis patients, on the other hand, receive ART at much lower doses. As their risk of MRONJ is much lower, implants are increasingly  utilized  in  these  patients  (Chadha,  Ahmadieh,  Kumar  &  Sedghizadeh, 2013). The risk of MRONJ in osteoporosis patients on low‐dose bisphosphonates is estimated to be 0.7 per 100,000 person‐years  of  exposure,  and  fewer  than  100  cases  of  MRONJ  after implant  therapy  in  this  group  of  patients  have  been  reported  (Ata‐Ali, Ata‐Ali, Penarrocha‐Oltra & Galindo‐Moreno, 2014).Until now, there is no evidence that the intravenous low‐dose administration carries a greater risk of MRONJ than oral medication, but precautions should be taken when planning and performing implant surgery  (Schimmel  et  al.,  2017).  Moderate  level  evidence  suggests  that patients suffering from osteoporosis have a higher incidence of tooth  loss  (Anil,  Preethanath,  AlMoharib,  Kamath  &  Anand,  2013).  This may be related to a higher level of osteoclastic activity and a less dense bony structure, favoring progress of periodontal bone resorption in response to gingival inflammation (Wang & McCauley, 2016).4.1.4 | Hyposalivation Hyposalivation  is  very  frequent  among  geriatric  patients,  not  only  as  a  consequence  of  radiotherapy,  but  mainly  as  a  consequence  of  polypharmacy. However, no study dealt directly with the influence of this condition on the survival, not to mention success, of implants and implant prosthesis, which constitutes a major knowledge gap in gero‐implantology.There are, however, studies that have investigated the influence of  Sjögren’s  syndrome  on  implant  survival.  A  very  recent  comparative  study  from  Korfage  et  al.  (2016)  indicated  that  the  condition  may be related to a higher risk of early implant failure.4.1.5 | Diabetes Type 2 diabetes signifies the body’s resistance and inability to produce adequate amounts of insulin. It is the most common form of the disease in geriatric patients. Among other symptoms, Type 2 diabetics can experience microvascular and vascular damage as well as an impaired wound healing. Patients are more susceptible to periodontitis  and  tooth  loss  (Persson,  2017).  The  main  marker  of  glycemic  control in diabetic patients is hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), and numerous studies identified in this review demonstrate that HbA1c levels above 8% may result in reduced implant survival compared to lower levels.4.2 | Strengths and weaknesses of the review Prospective  clinical  studies  on  implants  placed  in  geriatric  patients  are scarce. This may be due to a series of logistical challenges where older patients would require examination and treatment in their own home  or  a  residential  institution.  In  addition,  older  patient  cohorts  are  extremely heterogeneous, as  “not   all  old  are  old”   (Bürger, 1960).    The discrepancy between the biological and the numerical age can expand dramatically in advanced age, as the long‐term effects of nutrition,  lifestyle  choices,  socioeconomic  status,  and  disease  experience accumulate over a lifetime.The search for eligible studies for this systematic review was limited by the fact that a large body of evidence published in the 1980s and 1990s from prospective geriatric studies studied implants with turned/machined titanium surfaces. These surfaces are not relevant in daily practice anymore; hence these studies were excluded from this  review.  Further  weakness  arises  from  the  use  of  filters  in  our  search that might have inadvertently omitted some relevant articles. The  search  truncations  were  not  elaborately  used  for  more  search  terms in “all fields,” hence, this could have further limited the search yield. Furthermore, the search process of this review did not include conference proceedings. As the focus of this systematic review was not only on age, but also on comorbidity, a general lack of reporting on  the  medical  status  of  study  participants  was  noted  in  many  papers,  which  further  reduced  the  available  evidence  for  highlighting  the  effect  of  the  most  common  chronic  conditions  and  their  treatment in elderly patients.Initially,  a  further  exclusion  criterion  for  this  systematic  search  was  a  minimum  sample  of  10  participants  for  each  included  study.  During  the  abstract  screening,  it  became  obvious  that  many  studies  would  therefore  have  to  be  excluded.  Relevant  evidence  would  remain  unreported  in  this  review,  for  example,  in  relation  to  neurocognitive impairment where evidence is extremely scarce. It was, therefore,  decided  to  remove  this  exclusion  criterion  post  hoc.  However,  for  the  meta‐analyses,  studies  reporting  on  single  cases  or case series with less than 10 cases were still excluded, as Stewart et al.    (2015)     proposed in  the   CONSORT‐IPD statement the   inclusion of IPD would require a different approach.Unfortunately,  patient‐reported  outcome  measures  are  not  included in the analysis for this systematic review due to underreporting of the factors in most implant studies.The  strength  of  this  review  is  the  limitation  of  the  participants  included to  those    aged    of  75 years and   older.    Previous reviews exist on  the  use  of  implants  in  medical  compromised  patients  (Beikler  &  Flemmig, 2003;    Bornstein et al.,    2009,    2015),     but   none    have    previously  focused  on  the  impact  of  health  status  in  combination  with  aging  and  frailty.  Despite  a  comprehensive,  meticulous,  and  systematic  search,  this  review  did  not  identify  any  studies  on  implant  survival in relation to medical conditions in purely geriatric patients. Hence, this review too was not able to investigate the combined effect of age and chronic disease, and it was post hoc decided to report on any‐age implant survival rates in the most common geriatric medical  conditions.  Yet,  knowledge  on  the  interactions  of  old  age,  medical  conditions,  and  implant  survival  or  even  success  would  be  essential  for  clinical  decision‐making  and  meticulous  reporting  on  medical conditions in elder study participants should be encouraged for future studies on implant survival.Although  this  review  did  not  reveal  age  as  a  risk  factor  for  osseointegration, immunosenescence can potentially compromise the body’s  defense  mechanisms  where  the  bacterial  load  around  implants  challenges  the  health  of  the  peri‐implant  mucosa.  The  term  immunosenescence refers to the aging of the immune system. It was suggested that the human immune system declines in effectiveness with age (Preshaw, Henne, Taylor, Valentine & Conrads, 2017). This can  be  a  significant  issue  for  functionally  impaired  older  patients  when oral hygiene is neglected (Meyer et al., 2017).A further factor to be considered is that the implants in patients lost to follow‐up were excluded from the survival analysis. However, reporting on the uncensored survival rates could have possibly overwhelmed the results in a negative direction, providing an unrealistically negative picture. Dropout rates are high in geriatric studies, due to the high prevalence of medical conditions, functional impairment, and death. The bias introduced using censored data (the “unknown”) on  potential  knowledge  gain,  might  be  more  important  in  geriatric  studies than elsewhere in the literature.4.3 | Clinical relevance of the findings of this systematic review A  particularly  pertinent  aspect  of  this  review  is  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  survival  rate  of  implants  in  view  of  the  patient’s  life  expectancy  and  morbidity.  For  patients  affected  with  head  and  neck cancer, implants may be the only means to achieve a psycho‐social    and   functional rehabilitation (Müller et al.,    2004). Given    the  undoubted benefits of an implant retained restoration compared to removable alternatives for oncology patients, the use of implants may even be justified when implant survival rates are significantly below those reported for healthy patients. A similar viewpoint may apply  to  patients  with  hyposalivation,  as  wearing  a  conventional  denture  may  be  almost  impossible  due  to  a  lack  of  retention  and  pain caused by the intaglio surface rubbing on the dry and sensitive mucosa. Again, clinical decision‐making must not only be based on the survival rate, but rather on the patient’s subjective gain in quality  of  life,  comfort,  and  overall  well‐being  which  should  outweigh  the  associated  risks.  This  review  provides  a  valuable  insight  into  the survival rates of implants which are vitally important to advise patients as part of the consent procedure prior to undertaking any intervention.However,  it  should  be  noted  that  in  elderly  patients,  implant  success is rarely assessed in a relevant manner. An implant may be perfectly osseointegrated, but a patient with complex implant prostheses who is dependent on help for the activities of daily living may not wear or clean it anymore, because the management is too complex. This cannot be considered a successful treatment in this patient population (Müller & Schimmel, 2016).4.4 | Implications for research Substantial underreporting was noted on several important medical conditions in geriatric patients, which may have an impact on implant survival.  Future,  high‐quality  research  is  needed  with  comprehensive recording of study participants’ medical conditions, and standard  protocols  for  reporting  these  comorbidities  should  be  defined  based on the outcome of this systematic review.The  current  review  reveals  an  important  knowledge  gap  when  it  comes to implant therapy in elderly and geriatric patients. For some of the most common geriatric medical conditions such as cancer and diabetes, there is evidence available in relation to implant surgery and implant  prostheses—however,  almost  exclusively  from  younger  patient  groups. This limits the relevance of the findings for geriatric patients, who often take multiple medications and present with immunosenescence (Lopez‐Otin, Blasco, Partridge, Serrano & Kroemer, 2013) or delayed wound healing due to qualitative or quantitative protein‐energy malnutrition (Schimmel, Katsoulis, Genton & Müller, 2015).5 | CONCLUSIONSThe provision of implant‐supported/retained prostheses in geriatric subjects is a predictable treatment option with a high rate of implant survival. The functional and psychosocial benefits of an implant restoration should outweigh the reported relative risks associated with common medical conditions and their respective treatments.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The  authors  like  to  thank  Dr  Danielle  Layton  and  Beatrice  Gerber  for  critical  appraisal  of  the  manuscript.

Implants for the ageing population,J Dudley,"Dental implant treatment has established benefits over traditional alternatives. Age-related changes in systemic and oral health in conjunction with social, economic and resource considerations often introduce complexities into dental implant treatment of ageing patients. When time, opportunity, discomfort and maintenance costs are coupled with cost-benefit and quality of life predictions, otherwise simple treatment decisions can become more difficult. Implants for different types of prostheses in both arches and the different types of prostheses themselves present a variety of treatment challenges, risks, benefits and maintenance requirements. This narrative review discusses selective literature pertinent to the provision of dental implant treatment in the ageing population.Keywords:Ageing, implants, maintenance, patient assessment, risk factors, treatment options.","INTRODUCTION Successful dental treatment for the ageing population is best approached from an holistic perspective. The Influence of chronic diseases; the social, economic and resource characteristics of the ageing population; and age-associated changes in oral tissues present management challenges that require special attention. Limiting factors such as ability to tolerate the required procedures and future access to care, require careful consideration in the planning phase to ensure the proposed treatment is appropriate now and in the future.BACKGROUND Dental profile of the ageing population There is an established association between the mean number of missing teeth and age.1 Australians aged 65 years and over had a mean number of missing teeth of 12.1There was a reduction in edentulism between 1987–1988 and 2004–2006, which continues to the present time due to a change in treatment approach away from full mouth clearance of the 1920–1940s and the passing of older generations that experienced an epidemic of tooth loss.2 The prevalence of edentulism has been projected to further decrease to 1% of the total population by the 2040s.2 Coupled with the patterns of tooth loss and the ageing population 3 is an ever increasing life expectancy at birth listed at 80 years and 84 years for males and females respectively, as at 2008–2010.4Therefore, a discussion of implant treatment in the ageing population can no longer be limited to edentulous treatment options, rather the full range of options, some of which might only have been considered in younger populations in previous times.Treatment with dental implants Dental implant treatment has evolved over time from the use of subperiosteal, transosteal and endosseous plate (blade) form implants to endosseous root form implants that have become the mainstay of modern day implantology (Fig. 1). The first titanium dentalimplants were placed by Per-Ingvar Branemark inedentulous mandibles with long-term success estab-lished  and  reported.5,6The  restorative  aspect  ofimplant dentistry is now widely practised in the dentalprofession and in the US was the only prosthodonticprocedure that increased per capita from 1992 to2007, where the peak age for placement of implantswas between the ages of 60 and 75 years.7,8Suitably planned and managed dental implant treat-ment has established and accepted benefits over moretraditional options. However, dental implant treat-ment is considered expensive, usually involves long treatment times and requires patients to undergo thenecessary surgical and restorative procedures overmultiple appointments. IMPLANT CONSIDERATIONSThe age related implant literatureThere is a paucity of scientific evidence that reportsspecifically on implant dentistry for aged patients,9–12i.e. patients aged 65 years and over.1A limited num-ber of dental implant studies have solely and specifi-cally  set  out  to  investigate  the  variable  ofageing.10,11,13,14Age is one of the measurements obtained routinelywithin implant studies investigating other parametersalong with gender, implant site, number of patientstreated and implant type. Interestingly, age is often one of the first variables reported, yet appears to attract minimal commentary.Age and surgical implant placement In a literature review of implant dentistry for aged patients where similar implant survival rates were cited in older and other age groups, it was concluded‘old age is not a contraindication for implant therapy,however, clinicians should be aware of potential risks,possible  medical  complications,  and  psychosocial issues  that  affect  implant  prognosis  in  geriatric patients’.9A separate review of nine studies reporting on dental implant treatment in aged patients determined that treatment with implants could be considered safe and predictable for older as well as younger patients and ‘patients’ age does not seem to represent a factor of major prognostic significance’.10In a far reaching review of dental literature on evidence-based treatment planning for dental implants, there was no scientifically proven contraindication for the placement of implants based solely on increasing age.15In a comparison between closely matched groups of 190 implants in 39 patients aged 60–74 years and 184 implants in 43 patients aged 26–49 years, each with  similar  types  of  prostheses  observed  for 4–14 years, no statistically significant difference in implant survival was observed, although in looking purely at the percentages the older patient group in fact performed better.14 Despite the implant findings,the ‘average health’ of the younger group was better compared with the older group.14A variety of prostheses including single crowns, short-span prostheses,complete-arch prostheses and removable overdentures were involved in this particular study, and it was proposed implant survival was independent of the type of prosthesis.14 The authors also cited five studies that reported a 94–97% implant success rate in older patients and a 88–99% success rate in younger patients.14 On the basis of this evidence, it could be proposed that implants are more successful in older patients but the included studies suffer from a short follow-up period and the absence of matched control groups of younger adults.14The observation of equal or better implant survival in older populations compared with younger populations was agreed upon by other authors with poor oral hygiene being noted as the most common complication.16,17In further studies comprising significant numbers of implants placed for a variety of different prostheses in aged patients, some of whom had compromised general health, there was no correlation of age or medical status with implant survival.18–21A 96% implant success rate was reported in a study of 48 patients who were more than 80 years old treated with a total of 254 implants for bridges and some overdentures.22 Most  patients  had  minimal  post-implant placement problems, similar in nature to those observed in younger patients.22 The marginal bone response around the neck of the implant demonstrated a pattern of modelling and remodelling similar to that found in younger age groups.22 It was concluded that ‘no patients should be refused implant treatment because of advanced age’.22 The Toronto Study in 1994 concluded that neither advanced age itself nor the diminished levels of oral hygiene that often accompany it, are alone contraindications to ‘a prescription for treatment with osseointegration’.23,24 In  an  early  review  of  factors contributing to implant surgical success it was concluded that ‘in principle there are no specific contraindications for implant surgery, as long as other kinds of oral surgery can be performed’.25 All of the studies described to this point used a single type of implant within their study. In a study of three different endosseous implant types (a titanium plasma-sprayed cylinder, a titanium cylinder implant with hydroxyapatite coating, and standard threaded titanium) inserted in the anterior mandibles to support overdentures for 15 patients aged 65 to 80 years without serious systemic diseases, no implant failures were reported during the follow-up of three years.26 While the current review does not propose to consider the different implant types and surfaces used over time, one issue faced in comparing older and more recent studies is that older implants were predominantly turned (‘machined’) surfaces which were smoother in comparison to the modern day moderately roughened implants.27The bone response to moderately roughened implants has been found to be significantly  stronger  than  the  bone  response  to smoother or rougher surfaces.27The ‘All-on-Four’ protocol using tilted implants has provided additional alternatives for the restoration of posterior segments of the mouth without grafting and has been described as predictable.28In a review of 800 implants, a cumulative implant survival rate of 97% was reported for both axial and tilted implants assessed three months post-surgery after immediately loaded all-acrylic resin interim prostheses were constructed.28 Age, amongst other factors was not a significant parameter.28 Mini-implants, defined as implants less than 3 mm in diameter, have been recommended in implant treatment for aged patients as they can be placed in narrow ridges to reduce the need for grafting, offer simplified clinical procedures almost always involving flapless placement (potentially offering less traumatic surgery), offer potential for immediate loading, andare less expensive than small diameter implants for reasons that remain unclear.29 Despite mini-implants offering the clinician simplified treatment procedures without a steep learning curve, the available literature is scarce.29In a systematic review of the mini-implant literature, it was not possible to establish the true one-year survival rate as the minimum follow-up period for many implants within the included studies was less than one year and the authors concluded that currently there is no evidence for the long-term survival of mini-implants.29 Common themes Despite the shortcomings of some studies, the literature overwhelmingly supports implant treatment in aged patients. Older age groups were equally successful, and in some studies more successful than younger groups. However, the pertinent literature is generally old and often reports on implant types and surfaces no longer routinely used in modern day implant dentistry. One potential reason for the lack of more recent literature is that few older studies found significant differences in implant survival in different age groups, hence it became accepted that aged patients could reliably and predictably receive dental implant treatment and studies moved on to focus on more complex and perhaps more topical issues.The reported implant survival rates are generally 90% or more but significant limitations are the short follow-up times (of varying durations), small sample sizes in some studies, variations in location of implant placement within jaws and the variety of different prostheses constructed, thus limiting the effectiveness and appropriateness of interstudy comparison.The prostheses included are almost exclusively full-arch fixed or removable prostheses which are indicative of the type of treatment carried out for ageing populations in the era of observation. Some early studies claimed that implant success was independent of the type of prosthesis.Implant survival and success appeared to be used interchangeably in different papers largely due to ease of measurement and a lack of consensus in defining and measuring implant success. The patient’s medical status was not always reported. Oral hygiene tended to be an issue in aged patients receiving implant treatment but it was thought to be manageable by a period of cleaning and regular maintenance.Conflicting evidence In a study of risk factors for implant failure, the out-comes of 4680 implants placed in 1140 patients were reviewed and it was found that patients in the 60–79 years age group (18% failure rate) had a significantly higher risk of implant failure than patients younger than 40 years (9% failure).30The study is limited by the fact that a single operator performed all the implant surgery where interestingly one patient received a total of 24 implants.30The author concluded that there are no absolute contraindications to implant placement.30 In a seven-year multicentre longitudinal study of 1022 consecutively placed ITI implants it was noted the cumulative implant success rates for implants placed in patients aged over 60 years was 78% compared to patients aged less than 40 years (83%) and patients between 40 and 60 years (89%).31 The use of implant success criteria (instead of implant survival)in this study explains the lower success rates.31In a study of 68 patients treated with 204 implants(predominantly supporting overdentures) followed-up over 4–60 months, the possible reasons why 6% of implants failed to integrate were primarily due to overheating  during  surgery  and  secondarily  the advanced age of two patients and poor general health of one patient.32 The age profiles were not reported and therefore it is difficult to draw conclusions.The conflicting evidence is scarce and generally less convincing of a negative effect of increasing age on implant treatment. One shortcoming of all age-related studies is the difficulty in isolating age as a specific causative factor for the observed failures, where undiagnosed or subclinical general health conditions may underlie age and contribute to implant failure yet be impossible to identify and measure.Medical conditions influencing implant treatment In 2004–2005, 32% of the 65 years and over age group reported one chronic medical condition, with 23% reporting three or more chronic medical conditions.33 The 11 chronic diseases and conditions that were listed as having a large impact on the health and quality of life of Australians were coronary heart dis-ease, stroke, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, depression, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, oral diseases, arthritis and osteoporosis.34 Specific medical conditions (and their associated treatments) more commonly encountered in the ageing population often necessitate further investigation, consultation and management strategies prior to consider-ing   implant   treatment.   Undiagnosed   systemic conditions represent a further challenge and it is for the astute clinician to recognize oral signs of systemic disease and arrange appropriate further investigation.Different medical conditions pose different levels of risk to implant procedures. The more commonly encountered medical conditions have been differentiated into absolute and relative contraindications in an attempt to differentiate risk.15,35 Absolute contraindications preclude implant treatment and are usually obvious because treatment is clearly inappropriate, impossible or risks patient survival. They include conditions such as recent myocardial infarction, recent cerebrovascular accident and significant psychiatric disorders.35 It should be noted that patients in this category do not contribute to the reported success, survival or failure rates in the literature because they do not undergo implant treatment.Conversely, relative contraindications do not automatically preclude implant treatment but warrant careful assessment in the planning phase.36 It is important to consider the precise diagnosis, time since diagnosis (or more accurately time since onset), management (and degree of success with management),severity of the condition and potential impact of the medical condition on the planned implant procedures.While individual relative contraindications may not preclude implant treatment, combinations of relative contraindications, termed the cluster phenomenon,may collectively equate to an absolute contraindication.15,37In a review of a number of systemic host factors including age, gender, various medical conditions,patient habits and local host factors, it was advocated that ‘no systemic factor or habit is an absolute contraindication  to  the  placement  of  osseointegrated implants in the adult patient’.15 However, certain individual factors and combinations of factors may be associated with increased risks of implant failure.Physiological and pathological ageing Ageing has been differentiated into physiologic and pathologic.38 Physiological ageing refers to physical,metabolic and endocrine changes associated with age-ing whereas pathological ageing refers to specific medical  conditions  that  require  careful  consideration when considering implant treatment.38It is important that clinicians are aware of the physical, metabolic and endocrine changes associated with ageing, and how these changes may affect implant treatment.39 status was not always reported.

The prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age and is more prevalent in females than males.40The age range of 25–30 years has been reported as the time at which bone mineral density reaches its peak following which osteoclast activity exceeds osteoblast activity.38,41–43 Osteoporosis diagnosed at one particular site of the skeleton is not indicative of osteoporosis at other locations, which is logical as different bones at different locations are subject to different stresses which in turn influences remodelling.44 Osteoporosis has not been established as a risk factor  for  successful  osseointegration  of  dental implants.9,15,36,44 If there was a direct correlation between osteoporosis and osseointegration, then the rate of implant loss caused by osseointegration failure would increase relative to age and gender.44 The anterior mandible has been reported to not experience significant age-related osteopenia which is an important factor when considering implant treatment for aged patients.14,23,45 The use of bisphosphonate medications to slow osteoclastic activity in an attempt to slow the rate and severity of age-associated bone loss may have a deleterious effect on implant survival.46,47 However, the magnitude of the effect is dependent on the type of medication, route of administration and duration of use.46,47The observations of dental implant treatment in the ageing population are consistent with the orthopaedic literature that has established the efficacy of hip prostheses.11 Even though there is a decline in the capacity for fracture repair with increasing age, the effect of osteoporosis   on   fracture   repair   is   currently unfounded.48–50 Therefore, patients should not be denied dental implant treatment on the basis of a diagnosis of osteoporosis (or reduced bone mass),rather an assessment of the local site of planned implant placement, ideally by direct vision, appears the most appropriate form of management.15,51 Menopause In females, menopause is associated with reduced oestrogen levels that are in turn associated with increased bone resorption.38 Males are not immune from this process, with loss of bone mineral density starting after the age of 70 at a similar rate to females.38,52 Despite  postmenopausal  women  having  an increased risk for osteoporosis, oestrogen status is a concern with implants in the maxilla but not the mandible.36,53,54In one particular study, post-menopausal women receiving oestrogen therapy (as distinct from post-menopausal women not receiving oestrogen therapy) were correlated with a significantly increased failure rate, but it was stated that confounding factors may be present and further research was needed.30 A clear majority of studies have found that gender does not affect implant failure rates.15,55 Bone quality and quantity It has been stated that ‘the most important local patient factor for successful treatment is the quality and quantity of bone available at the implant site’.15 By bone quality, bone density is implied.Many different classifications of bone type and jaw shape have been proposed but one of the most universally accepted differentiates bone into four types,determined by different bone composition, and fiveshapes according to the degree of resorption post-extraction (Fig. 2).56 This classification was primarily instituted using a subjective assessment of panoramic and cephalometric radiographs.11 Bone quality is one reason for the differences in implant success at different sites of the mouth. A12–16% implant failure rate in type 4 bone compared to 4% in types 1–3 has been reported.57–60 Other Research has reported two and three-fold increases in implant failure rates in the maxilla compared with the mandible.30,53 Some sources have proposed a combination of bone volume and density is the most significant factor for implant success.61A review of biological factors contributing to failures of osseointegrated implants found partially edentulous patients had failure rates about half those of totally edentulous patients, explained by partially edentulous patients having less resorbed jaws and better bone quality.53 Increased implant failure rates have been found in sites of combined low bone volume and type 4 bone, a presentation more likely to be encountered in aged patients.11,15,62,63 It is generally accepted that older patients have longer healing times, and hence potentially require longer times for osseointegration.15,38,53 Primary implant stability has been established as an important criterion for implant success.64 The degree of primary implant stability and a failure to achieve primary implant stability showed the strongest association with the site of implant insertion but were not associated with age.60,65The quality and quantity of bone are best assessed preoperatively using three-dimensional  volumetric  tomography  and  again directly at the time of surgery.15,37 Specific conditions It is not the purpose of this review to comprehensively review the medical conditions encountered in the ageing population that may influence implant treatment.The literature is divided on whether some medical conditions found more frequently in aged patients represent contraindications for dental implant treatment.In some research, medical conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, steroid therapy, chemotherapy and head and neck radiation have been established as relative contraindications for dental implant treatment.30,66–69 Other research has found that individual medical conditions do not correlate with increased rates of implant failure, rather implant success is largely dictated by bone quality and quantity, and surgical technique.19,30,68,70–75 Oral hygiene There is a preconceived perception that older patients have poorer oral hygiene. While it could be expected that the ability to maintain good oral hygiene declines with age, it has been found that successful osseointegration can be achieved irrespective of the patient’soral hygiene.9,13,15,23,55,76 Poor oral hygiene has been associated with bone loss and peri-implant disease which if left unmanaged can lead to implant failure.77,78 It was demonstrated in an evaluation of 1692 implants that the failure rate of implants was significantly higher in patients subjectively evaluated with insufficient oral hygiene.79 As in periodontitis, it is likely that the process of bacterial accumulation around implants and its subsequent level of tissue destruction is markedly influenced by individual susceptibility and host response mechanisms.RESTORATIVE CONSIDERATIONS The restorative requirements of dental implant treatment for aged patients range in complexity from straightforward, minimally time consuming processes to complex procedures requiring multiple length appointments and high levels of patient compliance.For all cases, irrespective of age, implant treatment should be a restoratively driven process.While the goals of maximizing comfort, function and aesthetics remain prime treatment objectives, an important interplay of social, economic and time factors; individual assessment of maintenance requirements; risk of complications; and adaptive capacity exist in the ageing population. The following discussion of the restorative considerations for implant treatment is divided into the types of implant prostheses encountered most frequently in the ageing population in accordance with reports in the literature.Single and multiple tooth replacement Fixed prostheses Single tooth implant supported crowns have established benefits over treatment alternatives. A report on long-term prospective and retrospective cohort studies found the survival rate of implant supported single crowns was comparable to or exceeded that of conventional fixed restorations after 5 and 10 years follow-up.80In considering the findings from the literature reviewed in the first section of this paper that established implants can be placed successfully inhealthy aged patients without additional risk compared with younger populations, it would appear that implant treatment to replace single or multiple missing teeth in appropriately planned cases is the first treatment of choice.There is agreement in the literature that dental implant treatment has a high success rate, although different methodologies tend to limit interstudy comparisons.57,81–84 But the same studies present a common theme of a higher level of complications when compared to tooth-supported prostheses.57,81–84 At first glance, a survival rate for implant supported single crowns and implant supported fixed prostheses(replacing more than one tooth) of 95% at five years appears favourable.80At 10 years, a survival rate of87% for implant supported fixed prostheses and 89%for implant supported single crowns is still very good.80 However, during the five-year observation period, 39% of patients with implant supported fixed prosthesis (replacing more than one tooth) had some complications, substantially higher than the 16%complication rate reported for tooth-supported prosthesis.80 In the aged population, the need to attend andre-attend for expected or unexpected maintenance events may lead some patients towards a different treatment option. Therefore, a realistic dilemma exists in whether a single implant supported crown is in fact the best option for aged patients at the current time and over the next 10–20 years when there may be future predictable changes in manual dexterity, oral hygiene, mobility and ability to attend for maintenance and/or complications.Removable prosthesis Removable partial dentures, particularly with free-end saddles, are frequently problematic for patients, particularly for those with poor adaptive capacity. The use of implants to improve retention and/or reduce rotational movement of mandibular removable partial dentures has consistently provided greater patient satisfaction scores.85–87 High maintenance requirements of mandibular implant supported removable partial dentures have been reported, with up to 58% of patients requiring further prosthodontic repair within the first year of function.87,88 Although this treatment modality may be a low cost and beneficial alternative,the evidence is limited and only available in the short term.87 Edentulous patients Historically, older patients have been frequently treated with removable dentures. Clinicians have been remarkably successful in treating edentulous patients with complete dentures; however, there remain a large number of patients with varying degrees of success and a sub-group with no success at all who are a challenge to manage.9,10,89 Patients and clinicians often disagree about what constitutes a successful denture experience.23 It has been established that tooth loss and denture wearing results in a decrease in dietary adequacy and an inferior diet compared to dentate people.90 Edentulous mandible Removable complete dentures often present treatment challenges for the clinician and management issues for the patient. Dental implants can be utilized to assist with stabilization of removable complete dentures or alternatively to support a fixed implant prosthesis.Overdentures The advantages of mandibular implant overdentures have been well established and include aspects of functional, structural and psychosocial gain.91–93 The Literature contains a large volume of supportive evidence  for  this  treatment  modality.94–99 Dental Implants also assist in maintaining bone volume, thus resisting the rapid alveolar resorption patterns seen with removable partial dentures and to a lesser extent in dentate and edentulous sites.100 In a systematic literature review of 17 studies(including four randomized controlled trials), the survival  of  implants  predominantly  involving  two implants supporting a removable overdenture ranged from 93% to 100% at 10 years.101One included study  pooled  a  variety  of  different  overdenture designs, attachment types and numbers of implantand locations and reported a mandibular implant survival rate of 95% after 10 years.102 Clinicians may believe a greater number of implants provide better results; however, the literature is unsupportive. Although two implants placed bilaterally in the interforaminal region of the mandible appears to be the most accepted protocol, one, three and four implants have been proposed. The number of implants used to support an overdenture is not associated with different implant survivals, patient satisfaction oroverdenture maintenance.101,103–105 Patients have reported greater prosthesis satisfaction and masticatory capacity with mandibular implant overdentures compared to conventional full lower dentures over periods of 10 years.106 Other studies have concurred with these conclusions irrespective of the number of implants used,99,107–109 including a recent systematic review.110 The conversion of existing mandibular dentures to implant supported overdentures  was  reported  to  provide  significant improvements in oral health (as measured by the OHIP-20 profile) when compared to relining existing mandibular   dentures   in   dissatisfied   denturewearers.111In a multicentre randomized clinical trial, one group of patients was treated with mandibular implant supported overdentures and a new maxillary denture, and another group with a new set of complete dentures.112 It was established that the mandibular implant supported overdentures provided greater satisfaction with regard to denture related problems.112In a study of 34 patients aged 75 years or over who depended on help for daily living activities, patients were randomly assigned to receive two mandibular implants to support an overdenture or a relined conventional mandibular denture.93In the patients who received the mandibular implant overdenture treatment, an increased oral health-related quality of life was reported; however, chewing efficiency was no difference between the groups.93 The insertion of the mandibular implant overdenture was noted as problematic for some patients and their caregivers due to the nature of the Locatorâattachments, and in two cases the attachments were replaced by attachments that permitted easier insertion.93 This is an important consideration for patients who may not have the physical capacity to maintain appropriate oral hygiene or who suffer from muscle weakness-related conditions such as arthritis.It  has  been  established  in  the  literature  and observed in clinical practice that there is a reduction in the patient compensatory ability for the functional shortcomings of complete dentures with increasing age.93 Studies that investigate various treatments in aging populations are not necessarily able to make generalizations about the ageing age group as a whole, when there is a difference in adaptive capacity in ‘young old’ patients (less than 70 years) compared with ‘old old’ patients.93 High success rates of mandibular overdenture treatment have been reported in patients older than 80 years but importantly the patients were mostly living independently.13,93 The initial success of mandibular implant supported overdentures lead to the construction of the McGill Consensus Statement that proposed a two implant supported mandibular overdenture should become the‘first choice of treatment for the edentulous mandible’and  the  ‘first  choice’  standard  of  care.96 More Recently, the York Consensus Statement reinforced the concept that a ‘two implant supported mandibular overdenture should be the minimum offered to edentulous patients as a first choice of treatment’.97,98 The term ‘standard of care’ emanates from claims of negligence and malpractice, and assumes a duty of care owed to the patient was violated.113A standard of care does not imply a particular treatment regimen or that anything less is inferior and therefore negligent.113A consensus statement is different to a standard of care. Clinically relevant consensus statements should assist clinicians with decision making but at times fail to acknowledge individual patient variations and the difficulties faced in countries where significant access and economic barriers exist in providing effective dental treatment. Successful clinical treatment that fails to abide by a consensus statement may incorrectly be construed as substandard.Clinicians should take great care to avoid applying a single treatment concept to all edentulous mandibles, when obvious individual patient circumstances require careful assessment and consideration.114,115 Clinicians who have provided traditional (non-implant supported) full lower dentures to patients who have expressed satisfaction with the final prosthesis may rightly argue that they have not fallen short of providing the ‘minimum standard of care as a first choice of treatment’ as recommended by the McGill and York Consensus Statements.114 The multifactorial nature of implant overdenture treatment was highlighted in a study by Walton and MacEntee 116 were 36% of edentulous participants declined an offer of free implant treatment to support their mandibular dentures. The most common reasons for refusal were satisfaction with their current dentures and a fear of the surgical requirements and subsequent  treatment.116A  similar  observation  was found in a separate study where 7 of 23 participants declined the opportunity to receive two implants to support their existing mandibular denture for reasons of fear of surgery, pain or unperceived need for improvement.93 Overdenture maintenance Mandibular  implant  overdentures  require  variable degrees of maintenance at different stages of the prosthesis lifespan.94,101,117 Although there are established differences in the retentive strengths of various designs such as ball, bar and clip, and Locatorâattachments,there is a lack of conclusive clinical evidence that demonstrates the overall superiority of one particular system over another.101,117–119 No particular attachment system is associated with greater implant sur-vival120or greater patient satisfaction.94,101,117 When compared to mandibular complete dentures,more aftercare was needed for patients with mandibular implant supported overdentures.110,121 The choice of attachment system is important in patients who may have difficulty with maintaining sound oral hygiene as individual Locatorâattachments have been associated with a reduced prevalence of Candida  albicans denture-related  stomatitis  when  compared  to  bar attachments for mandibular implant overdentures.122 Fixed prostheses An alternative to the mandibular removable overdenture is a fixed prosthesis supported exclusively by at least three implants without mucosal support. A high implant survival rate has been established for mandibular fixed implant prostheses regardless of the loading protocols.6,28,123–126A 99% cumulative implant survival rate over five years has been reported for mandibular fixed prostheses in patients older than 80 years.127 In the Toronto Study involving the treatment of maladaptive complete denture patients with mandibular implant supported fixed prostheses, ‘every patient reported considerable satisfaction with the prosthetic result achieved’ and‘previous  complaints  disappeared  almost  immediately’.128 Fixed prosthesis maintenance It has been stated that ‘the prosthetic and surgical problems  and  complications  encountered  with geriatric patients are similar to those reported in younger patients’.9In a study of 264 patients mostly treated with mandibular fixed implant prostheses, an 86% overall prosthesis survival rate at 20 years was reported.129 However, this figure included significant‘anticipated’  and  ‘unanticipated’  prosthetic  and implant complications and further analysis revealed a50% complication rate at 5 years, 65% at 10 years and 89% at 20 years.129 In a systematic review of complications with fixed implant rehabilitations, whendata from maxillary and mandibular fixed implant prosthesis were pooled only 29% of prostheses at 5 years and 9% of prostheses at 10 years remained free of complications.130 It is difficult to accurately and specifically predict future maintenance events and complications for individual patients. Collectively, maintenance, complications, potential for retreatment and prosthesis lifespan constitute significant future management considerations for aged patients pursuing implant treatment in the mandible. Due to the reported high frequency of maintenance and maintenance requirements, mandibular fixed prostheses may be inappropriate for some aged patients and alternatively, more easily maintained treatment options may require consideration.Comparisons It may be thought that mandibular fixed prostheses provide greater levels of masticatory efficiency than removable overdentures because they resist movement.In an interesting comparative study investigating the masticatory function of patients who wore mandibular removable and fixed implant prostheses, eight patients received a fixed prosthesis and seven received a removable overdenture supported by a long bar.131 Part way through the study, each patient was fitted with the other type of prosthesis.131 The patients who wore mandibular overdentures reported a shorter mastication time for all foods.131 Lower costs have been associated with mandibular overdentures when compared with mandibular fixed prostheses over nine years of function.132,133 Two Implant supported mandibular overdentures have been established as a more cost-effective treatment option for patients with an edentulous mandible when compared to four implant supported prostheses.99 The Costs associated with two implant supported mandibular overdentures were reported as almost three times higher  than  conventional  dentures  and  for  four implant supported overdentures six times higher.99 Mandibular  implant  overdentures  have  been reported as more cost-effective than fixed implant prosthesis  for  maladaptive  denture  wearers.132 Patients seeking a fixed prosthesis need to invest more money initially and in the maintenance phase of treatment, and often require a longer time for treatment compared with mandibular implant overdentures.132 Edentulous maxilla Although the maxilla has been traditionally regarded as the easier of the two arches to treat with complete dentures, the same cannot be said for implant treatment. As with mandibular complete dentures, maxillary  complete  dentures  can  present  problems frequently related to retention, stability and the need for palatal coverage that are difficult for patients to manage. Restoration of the edentulous maxilla using implants is a complex and challenging procedure that requires meticulous planning.134OverdenturesTwo frequently proclaimed benefits of maxillary overdentures are aiding prosthesis retention and facilitating  a  reduction  in  palatal  coverage.118,135,136 Additionally, the capacity for easy and frequent prosthesis removal to facilitate oral hygiene is an attractive feature for some cases and patients.Inherent problems exist with maxillary implant overdentures as evidenced in the limited available literature.114,137,138 Maxillary overdenture implant survival rates are the lowest of all implant prosthesis types and have been reported as low as 71% at five years.57,118 In a systematic literature review 101(including only four suitable studies, none of which were randomized controlled  trials)  investigating  implants  generally involving four to six implant maxillary overdentures,the implant survival rate was 75% after seven years in the one study that reported maxillary implant survival.139 Two other studies reported an implant success rate of 72% after 5 years 140 and 84% after 6 years,141 and the final study pooled maxillary and mandibular implant data.24A distinct lack of evidence for observation periods of 10 years or more was noted.101 Overdenture maintenance High prosthetic maintenance requirements have been reported for maxillary implant overdentures when compared with mandibular implant overdentures but have been difficult to standardize.95,101,114,118 The limitations in vertical space for prosthetic components may be an important explanatory factor.101 In contrast, and as an indication of the lack of clarity in this area, a systematic review found comparable prosthetic maintenance requirements existed for implant overdentures in the maxilla and mandible; however, this finding appears to be in the minority.119 The first specific systematic literature review of maxillary implant overdenture maintenance requirements established the maintenance requirements were a ‘direct consequence of the attachment system’.95 Although ultimately dictated by clinician preference rather than the scientific evidence, unsplinted implants attachment systems may offer greater ease for hygiene and greater ease for maintenance or repair thansplinted  attachment  systems.94,114,136,137 In  accordance with mandibular implant overdenture literature,there is no particular attachment system that demonstrates superiority over others for maxillary implant overdentures.101 Fixed prostheses Alternatively, a prosthesis may be constructed that is generally attached to four or more implants in the maxilla. The provision of maxillary fixed prostheses for any population group is a particularly complex treatment necessitating thorough and precise planning with high levels of patient compliance.Although also of importance with maxillary overdentures, maxillary fixed implant prostheses requireadditional careful and strategic assessment of the following aesthetic parameters that are crucial to the success of the treatment: facial form in three dimensions; lip position in repose and smiling; lip tonicity;tooth alignment; incisal edge position; gingival display; potential lip support (potentially necessitating a labial flange best provided by an overdenture); andspeech.134,142 Collectively, these factors necessitate precise implant placement which can be assisted by three-dimensional volumetric tomography in conjunction with treatment planning software programmes. A Change in treatment plan from a removable to a fixed prosthesis necessitated by suboptimal implant positioning, implant failure or a failure to recognize initial limiting factors may be disappointing for the patient and problematic for the clinician.134 Favourable implant survival rates have been reported for implants placed for fixed prostheses in the maxilla,irrespective  of  the  loading  protocol.57,143–146 Instances of single implant failure, fixed prostheses cansurvive either on the remaining implants or on replacement implants, but in some instances require conversion to removable overdentures supported by the remaining implants.124,144–146 The established high failure rate specifically for maxillary overdentures adds an additional dimension to cases converted to removable overdentures.57,101,118,139–141 Fixed prostheses maintenance In a meta-analysis of prosthodontic complications offixed implant prostheses in edentulous patients, cumulative 67% veneering material fracture rate and44% material wear over 15 years was reported for combined maxillary and mandibular prostheses.147 The authors commented that ‘in the hands of experienced  operators,  complications  occur  frequently enough to concern clinicians of lesser experience’.147A 15-year follow-up of 76 consecutive patients(with a mean age of 60 years) provided with fixed implant prostheses in edentulous upper jaws established a 91% implant and prosthesis cumulative survival rate although a high loss to follow-up was reported due to the age at first surgery.146 The most frequent problem encountered was resin veneer fracture  up  to  10 years,  then  severe  wear  in  the 11–15 year  interval.146 This  study  highlighted  a significant limitation in ageing population studies of a high loss to follow-up due to patients changing location, moving into care facilities, sickness and death.Maintenance requirements for fixed implant prostheses can be time consuming and costly, and are important  considerations  for  prospective  patients.Importantly, prosthesis complications do not tend to affect implant survival. Patients may also need to be without their prosthesis for some time while the repair and maintenance work is carried out, and for this reason it is important that retrievability is built into prosthesis design. Maintenance and repair procedures may be challenging for patients with fixedimplant prostheses with limited mobility or in nursing homes, and consideration should be given to providing removable prostheses with individual implant attachments that facilitate caregiver insertion, removal and hygiene.Comparisons It may be reasonably expected that a fixed prosthesis is preferred by patients because it is more stable than any removable appliance.148 In a within-subject comparison of maxillary removable and fixed prostheses,five patients were provided with an implant supported maxillary removable overdenture and eight patients with an implant supported maxillary fixed prosthesis,all opposing a mandibular implant overdenture.148 After two months each patient was fitted with the other type of prosthesis for a further two months.148 The patients who wore the removable maxillary overdentures (with a long bar design and without palatal coverage) reported higher ratings of general satisfaction, ability to speak and ease of cleaning compared with the fixed prostheses.148 Adaptation to new prostheses The level of difficulty in adapting to a new prosthesis later in life is difficult to predict and measure.10 Treatment with dental implants must be considered in the context of a general trend of declining patient adaptive capacity with age that often results in problems.15 Some researchers have commented that patients who have been edentulous for several years and are therefore experienced denture wearers may be more likely not to be dissatisfied with their loose lower denture and less prepared to accept comprehensive treatment with implants.10,149 In a study of 48 patients greater than 80 years of age who had implants placed to  support  predominantly  mandibular  prostheses,10% of patients experienced obvious problems with general adaptation and muscle control which had not been observed in younger patients.22 Problems with the literature–success, survival,complications and maintenance In order to accurately assess and report on implant success, it is necessary to measure appropriate clinical and radiographic parameters that may be benchmarked  against  standards.  The  most  commonly accepted criteria for implant success was originally proposed by Albrektsson and colleagues,150 and subsequently simplified by Zarb and Albrektsson.151 It Required an implant to satisfy four criteria that focused on a healthy and harmonious relationship of the implant within the bone (Table 1).150–152 More recently, new implant success parameters have been introduced such as health status of the peri-implant soft tissue (including plaque scores, gingival health index, presence of infection, bleeding), soft tissue contour, and patient-centred outcomes such as Pink Esthetic Scores.152,153 The variable methodologies employed to measure implant success are a significant problem in the literature and limit interstudy comparison, and often reduce the number of studies possible to include in systematic reviews.In addition, the use of implant survival (the presence or absence of an implant irrespective of the status, or presence or absence of problems), prosthesis survival (the presence or absence of the prosthesis)and prosthesis success (the assessment of more subjective parameters such as precision of fit, aesthetics, patient satisfaction and absence of complications 152)as measures  of implant treatment  introduce further  complexities  and  variables  in  the  reported literature.During the lifespan of a prosthesis, maintenance(expected  events)  or  complications  (unexpected events) may occur that may or may not require inter-vention. The accuracy of the maintenance literature is problematic due to the uncertainty in what constitutes acceptable maintenance or repair; the reporting and varying definitions of maintenance; and the differences in classification of complications, adjustment and retreatment.95,154 The variations in the methodologies used to assess implant treatment and the lack of consistency in categorization have at times resulted in very different out-comes from similarly focused research of similar treatments. Further complicating the ability of this review to provide definitive, scientifically based guidelines is the observation that much of the literature relating to the outcomes of single  and multiple implant prostheses is not age specific. Therefore, it is only possible to provide a general perspective.Social, economic and additional considerations Social considerations in the context of dental treatment for the aged can be complex, poorly communicated and misunderstood. Issues may vary from quite subtle dissatisfaction with appearance or function to genuine recluse that can mitigate the levels of desire and motivation for treatment.The economic cost of any prosthodontic intervention is a balance between initial capital outlay (involving professional fees, laboratory fees and implant componentry costs), maintenance and repair costs,and any hidden costs of the service.154–157 While Other less expensive treatment options exist, the benefits gained from dental implant treatment can be significant but at the same time difficult to measure. The Economic cost of treatment is particularly important for the ageing population when income streams maybe limited and/or fixed.Additional elements of time, opportunity, discomfort and maintenance costs also play key roles both individually and collectively, and can be difficult to measure but at the same time often carry great significance for aged patients. When the costs exceed the perceived value, treatment may be questioned,alternatives considered or treatment declined. When The costs can be justified, treatment may proceed and patients are more likely to value their prostheses.159 Clinicians tend to make negative stereotypical views of the ageing population on aspects such as life expectancy, manual dexterity and economic status.   Further, clinicians may at times be asked by aged patients, either directly or indirectly, to make judgements on the most suitable treatment option; a sometimes difficult and challenging task.CONCLUSIONS Aged patients do not appear to be associated with different implant success rates compared with younger patients.The quality and quantity of bone available for implant placement are more important predictors of implant success than age. Local bone conditions are both age and site specific.It is difficult to assess the isolated effect of ageing on implant treatment success due to the multifactorial nature of implant treatment, the diversity of variables that comprise implant treatment, confounding factors that affect treatment outcomes, variations in study designs and the issues faced in isolating age as a stand-alone element.The scientific literature on implants in ageing populations is old and generally involves the treatment of edentulous patients.Outside obvious absolute contraindications, most well-managed medical conditions commonly encountered in the ageing population do not pose a contraindication to treatment but may influence implant success and survival.The replacement of single teeth with implant prostheses can be provided with the same success and relative risk in older populations compared with younger populations.Different types of prostheses are associated with different levels of success, patient satisfaction and maintenance.The mandible is very different to the maxilla as demonstrated by the different implant and prosthesis success and survival rates.Maintenance requirements for most implant prostheses are significant, and in conjunction with the consideration of the patient’s ability to maintain the prosthesis and their ease of access to future aftercare in later stages of life, is a crucial treatment consideration for aged patients. Short-term benefit must be balanced with long-term maintenance.Different studies employ different methods of measurement for investigating the same variables which limits cumulative analysis and interstudy comparisons.The use of implant survival provides different results to the use of implant success which does not have universally standardized and accepted criteria. Therefore,readers are challenged to have a thorough knowledge of the subject matter before interpreting and applying the findings from individual studies, and at all times should pay careful attention to the specific methodology used.There are significant porosities in the literature that result in a lack of definitive clinical treatment guidelines, particularly for the restorative aspect of implant treatment, which requires clinicians to often managecases on the basis of clinical experience, rational judgement and belief rather than an established evidence base.Modern day implants have not yet been observed and reported in the literature for periods of 15 years or more. Much of the literature relating to the outcomes of single and multiple implant prostheses is not age specific. DISCLOSURE The author has no conflicts of interest to declare.","1.

How old is old for implant therapy in terms of implant survival and marginal bone levels after 5–11 years?,"Onur Etöz, Kristina Bertl, Edmund Kukla, Christian Ulm, Nurdan Ozmeric, Andreas Stavropoulos","Aim: To evaluate implant survival and marginal bone levels (MBLevel) at least 5 years after implant installation in patients ≥65 years old.Methods: Patient records were screened retrospectively for the following inclusion criteria: (1) ≥65 years of age at the time of implant installation, and (2) ≥5-year radiographic follow-up or registered implant loss. Association between patient- and implant-related data with radiographically assessed data [i.e. implant survival, mean MBLevel (i.e. average of mesial and distal level) and maximum marginal bone loss (i.e. either mesial or distal loss; maximum MB Loss)] were statistically evaluated by mixed effects multilevel regression models.Results: Two-hundred-eighteen  implants  in  74  patients  were  included  with  a  mean  follow-up of 6.2 years (range: 5 to 10.7 years); four early and six late implant losses have been registered (implant survival rate: 95.4%). Mean MBLevel and maximum MBLosswas 1.24 ±    0.9 mm and 1.48 ±    1.0 mm, respectively. Maximum MBLoss<    2   mm, 2 to 5  mm and ≥5 mm was found in 70.7, 28.8 and 0.5% of the implants, respectively. For both, mean MB Level and maximum MB Loss, age presented a slightly protective effect (mean MBLevel: Coef. −0.041, p = .016; maximum MB Loss: Coef. −0.045, p = .014).Conclusion: The high implant survival rate (95.4%), low mean MBLevel (1.24 mm) and low frequency of maximum MBLoss ≥  5  mm (0.5%) observed herein after 5 to 11 years follow-up  suggest  that  older  age  should  not  be  considered  as  a  limiting  factor  for  implant treatment.KEYWORDS aging, dental implant, elderly patient, implant survival, marginal bone loss, risk factor","1 | INTRODUCTION Life expectancy and thus the elderly population is increasing due to an improved health care and increased personal wealth. Despite improved efforts  for  dental  prophylactic  measures,  increased  age  is  associated  with higher number of lost teeth (Feine et al., 2002; Müller et al., 2007; Schimmel  et  al.,  2017).  Tooth  loss  leads  to  impaired  chewing  function,  which  in  turn  may  result  in  poor  nutrition  intake,  and  in  general reduced  quality  of  life  (Fontijn-Tekamp  et  al.,  2000;  Sheiham  et  al.,  2001).  Although  installation  of  dental  implants  has  become  a  common treatment choice for replacing missing teeth (Klinge et al., 2018; Trullenque-Eriksson  &  Guisado-Moya,  2014),  elderly  patients  choose  implant treatment less often compared with other age groups (Visser et  al.,  2011;  Zitzmann  et  al.,  2007).  This  may  be  because  elderly  patients are often reluctant to the surgical intervention for implant installation  due  to  higher  costs  or  limited  knowledge  about  dental  implant  treatment itself (Müller et al., 2012; Tepper et al., 2003). Nevertheless, it can be expected that independent elderly in high-income countries will choose dental implants increasingly often in the future (Madianos et al., 2016; Meijer et al., 2001; Schimmel et al., 2017).A potential concern regarding dental implant therapy in elderly patients  is  the  risk  of  compromised  wound  healing  (Bartold  et  al.,  2016; Zarb & Schmitt, 1994). Wound healing might be compromised due  to  ageing  itself,  but  also  due  to  a  higher  prevalence  of  chronic  diseases  in  this  group  of  patients,  which  are  interfering  with  the  wound healing process (Chrcanovic et al., 2014; Wood et al., 2004). Recently it was reported that ageing does not seem to compromise osseointegration in terms of higher numbers of early implant losses (EIL)  (Bertl  et  al.,  2019).  However,  compromised  wound  healing  is  not  the  only  concern  in  terms  of  dental  implant  therapy  in  elderly  patients; the ability to maintain a sufficient oral hygiene, to seek regularly  supportive  treatment  and  to  handle  removable  restorations  appear even more important for a successful treatment outcome and avoidance  of  biological  complications  on  the  long-term  (Schimmel  et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the use of dental implants in elderly patients  is,  in  general,  considered  as  a  predictable  treatment  option  (de Baat, 2000; Jemt, 1993; Schimmel et al., 2017, 2018; Srinivasan et al., 2017), but long-term results (i.e. ≥5 years of follow-up) are still relatively rare.The  present  study  aimed  to  evaluate  implant  survival  and  marginal bone levels/loss at least 5 years after implant installation in patients ≥65 years old.2 | MATERIAL AND METHODS 2.1 | Study population The  study  protocol  of  the  present  retrospective  long-term  cohort  study   was   approved   by   the   ethics   committee   of   the   Medical   University of Vienna (EK-Nr. 1980/2016) and reporting complies with  the  STROBE  guidelines  (Appendix  S1).  The  dental  records  of  all  patients,  who  received  dental  implants  at  the  Division  of  Oral  Surgery  (Medical  University  of  Vienna,  Austria)  between  10/2006  and  12/2012,  were  screened  for  the  following  inclusion  criteria:  (1) ≥65 years of age at the time of implant installation and (2) ≥5-year  radiographic  follow-up  after  implant  installation  or  registered  implant loss. This specific timeframe was chosen to allow a 5-year follow-up at the time of screening. Further, it should be noted that the population included herein is also part of a previous publication (Bertl et al., 2019). 2.2 | Patient- and implant-related parameters The  following  patient-related  data  were  extracted:  (1)  age  and  (2)  smoking  status  at  the  time  of  implant  installation,  (3)  gender,  (4)  periodontal   diagnosis   [i.e.   periodontally   healthy,   periodontally   diseased and staged according to the 2017 World Workshop on the classification of periodontal and peri-implant diseases and conditions (Tonetti et al., 2018), or edentulous], and (5) presence/absence of relevant  systemic  diseases  [i.e.  diabetes,  osteoporosis,  rheumatoid  arthritis,    inflammatory    bowel    diseases    and    hyperthyroidism].    Further,   the   following   implant-related   parameters   had   been   recorded: (1) number of implants per patient, (2) implant region (i.e. upper/lower/posterior/anterior), (3) implant diameter (i.e. ≤3.5/3.5 to 4.5/≥4.5 mm), (4) implant length (i.e. <10/≥10 mm), (5) implant type (i.e. bone level/tissue level), (6) implant connection type (i.e. internal/external), (7) bone augmentation prior to or simultaneously to implant installation,  (8)  type  of  supra-structure  (i.e.  fixed/removable),  (9)  supra-structure with single or multiple units (i.e. fixed or removable dental prosthesis on multiple connected implants/removable supra-structure combining implants and teeth/removable supra-structure on multiple, not connected implants), (10) type of opposing dentition (i.e.  natural  teeth/implant-borne  prosthesis/removable  prosthesis),  (11)   follow-up   period   after   implant   installation,   (12)   timeframe   between implant installation and delivery of the supra-structure and (13) loading time.2.3 | Radiographic parameters Panoramic  and  periapical  radiographs  and  data  from  the  dental  records were used for extracting the following outcome parameters: (1) implant loss (i.e. EIL or late implant loss with EIL occurring before prosthetic  restoration  and  late  implant  loss  thereafter),  (2)  mean  marginal  bone  level  (i.e.  mean  of  the  mesial  and  distal  level;  mean  MBLevel)  and  (3)  maximum  marginal  bone  loss  (i.e.  either  mesial  or  distal  loss;  maximum  MB Loss).  Further,  maximum  MB Loss  was  categorised  as  follows:  (1)  <2  mm, (2) 2 to 5 mm and (3) ≥5 mm maximum MBLoss.Radiographs (i.e. panoramic and/or periapical radiographs) from the  time  of  implant  installation  (i.e.  baseline)  and  last  available  follow-up  were  used  for  measuring  MB Level.  Since  the  present  study  is  retrospective,  the  periapical  radiographs  were  not  standardised;  however,  all  of  them—as  a  standard  in  this  clinic—were  taken  with  the  parallel  technique.  The  radiographs  were  first  calibrated  based  on the known implant length. Thereafter, the mesial and distal corners of the implant shoulder and the most coronal bone-to-implant contact/MBLevel  at  the  mesial  and  distal  aspect  were  marked,  and  their distance was linearly measured parallel to the implant surface (Figure 1). The difference between the baseline and follow-up radio-graphs  represented  MBLoss  or  in  seldom  cases  marginal  bone  gain  (MBGain).  A  single  examiner  (O.E.)  assessed  the  radiographs  under  standardised conditions (i.e. on the same computer screen with the same settings, in a darkened room) with an image analysis program (Photoshop  CC,  Adobe  Systems).  Radiographs  were  assessed  in  a  random  sequence  (i.e.  baseline  and  follow-up  radiographs  of  the  same implant were not judged one after the other). Previously, a calibration  session  of  the  main  examiner  together  with  2  co-authors  (K.B.,  A.S.)  was  performed  by  assessing  30  radiographs  displaying  different implant systems and MBLevel. Intra-observer repeatability was assessed by re-measuring 15% of all radiographs with a 2 weeks interval.2.4 | Statistical analysis Statistical analysis comprised descriptive analysis and mixed effects multilevel regression models to analyse any effect of the assessed parameters on mean MB Level and maximum MBLoss. For descriptive analysis,  the  cohort  was  additionally  subdivided  into  4  age  groups  at the time of implant installation: (1) 65 to 69.9 years, (2) 70 to 74.9   years, (3) 75 to 79.9 years and (4) ≥80 years. Due to the limited number of implant losses no regression analysis was performed on “implant loss” as primary outcome parameter.By means of mixed effects multilevel regression analyses with a random intercept model where implants were nested within patients using  an  unstructured  covariance  structure  any  associations  between the primary outcome parameters (“mean MB Level” and “maximum MBLoss”) and various secondary outcome parameters (i.e. age, gender,  smoking  status,  periodontal  diagnosis,  systemic  diseases,  number  of  implants  per  patient,  implant  region,  diameter,  length,  type,  implant  connection  type,  necessity  of  bone  augmentation,  type of supra-structure, supra-structure with single or multiple unit, type  of  opposing  dentition,  follow-up  period  after  implant  installation,  timeframe  between  implant  installation  and  delivery  of  the  supra-structure,  loading  time)  were  assessed  in  2  steps.  First,  each  secondary outcome parameter was tested in a univariate approach. Thereafter,  all  parameters  being  relevant  predictors  based  on  a  0.20-level in the univariate analyses were combined in the final multivariate model. The effects of these predictors on both primary outcome parameters were assessed by Wald and LR test. Intra-observer repeatability  was  tested  with  the  intraclass  correlation  coefficient  (ICC 1.1). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Version 24.0 (SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago,  IL,  USA)  and  STATA  (StataCorp  LLC,  USA)  and  p-values< .05 were considered as statistically significant.3 | RESULTS 3.1 | Study population Two hundred and eighteen implants in 74 patients (51.4% female) were included in the present retrospective long-term cohort study, with most of the patients (i.e. 56.8%) being between 65 and 70 years old  at  the  time  of  implant  installation.  Mean  follow-up  was  6.2  ±1.2   years, ranging from 5 to 10.7 years. A few patients smoked at the time of implant installation and/or reported any systemic disease (i.e. <10%), while most of the patients (i.e. 83.8%) were either edentulous or  treated  for  periodontitis  prior  to  implant  installation.  For  details  see Table 1.3.2 | Implant characteristics Forty-three  patients  received  less  than  four  implants,  22  patients  four implants and nine patients more than four implants. 40.8% of the implants were placed in the lower posterior, and 27.1% in the lower anterior. In 41 cases (18.8%), some kind of bone augmentation procedure  was  performed.  The  majority  of  the  implants  were  between 3.5 and 4.5 mm (68.8%) in diameter. Furthermore, except for two tissue-level implants, implants were bone level implants and except for seven implants with an external connection, implants had an internal connection. About 85% of the implants were restored with a fixed supra-structure and in 71% of the implants multiple implants/units were combined in the prosthetic restoration; interestingly, for more than half of the implants a removable restoration was present in the opposing dentition. For details see Table 1.3.3 | Early and late implant losses In nine patients (three female), four EIL (i.e. after <0.4  years; 1.8% on the implant level) and six late (i.e. after 1.7 to 5.5 years; 2.8% on  the  implant  level)  implant  losses  were  registered  resulting  in a survival rate of 87.8 and 95.4% on the patient and implant level,  respectively.  All  patients  experiencing  implant  loss  had  a  history  of  periodontitis  (i.e.  stage  3  or  4)  but  were  not  classified  as  multimorbid  and  none  were  smoking  at  the  time  of  implant  installation (Table 2). Due to the low number of either early or late implant  losses  a  random-effects  logistic  regression  analysis  was  not meaningful.3.4 | Radiographic outcome Radiographs representing baseline where only orthopantomograms; at follow-up, 178 orthopantomograms and 30 periapical radiographs were available. Reliability evaluation showed a high degree of intra-observer repeatability; that is ICC was 0.926 and 90.3% of the re-measurements deviated maximum 0.5 mm, while the deviation of the remaining 9.7% was within 0.7 mm.Based  on  208  implants,  mean  MBLevel  and  maximum  MBLosswas  1.24  ±  0.9  mm  (range:  0.4  mm  MBGain to 5.0    mm MBLoss)  and  1.48 ± 1.0 mm (range: 0.2 mm MBGain to 5.6    mm MBLoss), respectively.  Interestingly,  compared  to  the  younger  age  cohorts,  mean  MB Level was > 50% less in the cohort ≥80 years of age; however, only 17 im-plants were included in this cohort (Figure 2). Maximum MBLoss< 2, 2 to 5, and ≥5 mm was observed in 70.7%, 28.8% and 0.5% of the implants, respectively (Figure 3).The  results  of  the  univariate  and  multivariate  regression  analysis  for  mean  MB Level  and  maximum  MBLoss  are  reported  in  Tables  3  and  4,  respectively.  In  terms  of  mean  MBLevel,  only  age,  implant  region, implant length and follow-up period after implant installation appeared relevant in the univariate analysis (i.e. p <    .02; Table 3) and age  and  implant  length  remained  significant  in  the  final  multivariate model (Table 4). Specifically, higher age had a slightly protective effect  on  mean  MBLevel (Coef. −0.041, p =  .016),  while  higher  implant length (i.e. ≥10 mm) resulted in slightly increased mean MBLevel(Coef. 0.571, p = .048). In terms of maximum MBLoss the same four parameters  (i.e.  age,  implant  region,  implant  length  and  follow-up  period  after  implant  installation)  presented  with  a  p-value<  .20  in  the  univariate  analysis  (Table  3),  however,  only  age  remained  statistically  significant  in  the  final  multivariate  model  (Table  4),  that  is  age  also  had  slightly  protective  effect  on  maximum  MBLoss  (Coef.  −0.045, p =.014).  Considering  for  both  primary  parameters  (mean  MB Level  and  maximum  MBLoss)  the  overall  effects  of  the  four  predictors (i.e. age, implant region, implant length and follow-up period after implant installation) based on a LR test only age presented with statistical significance (mean MBLevel: p =    .0213; maximum MBLoss: p = .0197).4 | DISCUSSION In the present retrospective cohort study in a university setting, high implant survival rate (95.4%), low mean MBLevel (1.24 mm) and low frequency  of  severe  MBLoss (i.e. ≥5 mm; 0.5%) was observed 5 to 11  years after implant placement in patients ≥65 years of age; in fact, age appeared to have a slight but statistically significant protective effect in terms of mean MB Level and maximum MBLoss.The  high  implant  survival  rate  observed  herein  is  in  accordance  with  what  was  presented  in  meta-analyses  of  studies  assessing  implant treatment in elderly patients. Specifically, in patients ≥ 65 years old  a  post-loading  implant  survival  rate  of  96.2  and  91.2%  was  calculated after 5 and 10 years in function, respectively (Srinivasan et al., 2017), and in geriatric patients (i.e. ≥75 years) a survival rate of 97.3 and 96.1% was found after 1 and 5 years, respectively (Schimmel et al., 2018). These rates of implant survival are overall comparable to those reported for the general population: 97.2 and 95.2% for single tooth implants (Jung et al., 2012) and 95.6 and 93.1% for implants supporting fixed dental prostheses (Pjetursson et al., 2012) after 5 and 10 years, respectively. In this context, in the original studies included in the above-mentioned systematic reviews, information on EIL, that is  implant  loss  before  functional  loading  of  the  implants,  was  often  missing. It may thus be argued that the high implant survival rates in the above-mentioned studies are because EIL is not always captured in  those  numbers.  The  combination  of  several  factors,  such  as  compromised wound healing due to ageing, higher prevalence of chronic diseases  and/or  higher  medication  intake,  might  affect  the  wound  healing  process  in  this  group  of  patients  (Chrcanovic  et  al.,  2014;  Wood  et  al.,  2004);  thus,  EIL  could  indeed  be  more  frequent  in  the  elderly. Nevertheless, in the present group of patients, the rate of EIL was quite low (i.e. 1.8% on the implant level). Further, a previous study based  on  a  larger  group  of  patients  from  this  clinic  (i.e.  the  patients  included herein are part of this previous publication) assessed specifically EIL (Bertl et al., 2019); in 444 patients ≥65 years of age at the time of implant installation with 1517 implants, EIL rate was 0.66% on the implant level. In the same study (Bertl et al., 2019), 347 patients of the elderly group were also matched to a younger patient cohort (i.e. <55   years old at implant installation), based on specific criteria; EIL was shown to be 1.44 vs. 2.59%, respectively, in the matched cohorts. In another retrospective study (Engfors et al., 2004) on 133 patients aged ≥80 years with 761 implants only 6 early implant failures (i.e. 0.8% on the implant level) were recorded; the control group consisting of 115 patients aged <80  years (mean age: 65 years) with 670 implants registered also 6 early implant losses (i.e. 0.9% on the implant level).One  explanation  for  the  low  implant  loss  rates  in  the  elderly  may  be  that  those  finally  receiving  dental  implants  are  probably  selected  more  carefully  by  their  dentist  and  are  in  general  healthier than those choosing another type of prosthetic solution or no treatment. Indeed, the population evaluated herein cannot be  considered  as  multimorbid,  that  is  the  prevalence  of  smoking  and  any  systemic  disease  (e.g.  diabetes  or  osteoporosis)  did  not  exceed 8%. Only the periodontitis prevalence (primarily stage 3 and 4) was relatively high with almost 85% (including the edentulous  patients);  however,  the  treatment  standards  of  this  department  require  a  successful  periodontal  treatment  before  any  implant installation is considered. Altogether, one might argue that the missing effect of any systemic disease might be at least partly due to the small number of patients being actually diseased in the present group of patients (Table 1). This lack of effect of systemic condition  on  implant  survival  agrees  well  with  the  results  of  a  previous systematic review (Schimmel et al., 2018) on the impact of systemic medical conditions on implant therapy in the elderly. In  that  study,  mainly  patients  after  radiotherapy  in  the  head  and  neck region and those receiving high-dose antiresorptive therapy due to cancer, respectively metastases, presented a higher risk for implant-related  complications  and  failures.  Other  diseases,  such  as cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus type II (if well controlled), or patients receiving low-dose antiresorptive therapy for osteoporosis presented high implant survival rates. Nevertheless, care  should  be  taken  for  patients  on  long-term  bisphosphonate  intake (i.e. > 36 months) or with comorbidities, since there is risk for  medication-related  osteonecrosis  of  the  jaws  (Stavropoulos  et al., 2018). In perspective, it has to be pointed out that presence/absence  of  any  systemic  disease  herein  was  recorded  only  once  at the time of implant installation but not thereafter. Thus, possible changes over time are not captured herein. Similarly, no effect of  smoking  on  the  outcome  parameters  assessed  was  observed,  although  it  has  been  clearly  described  that  smoking  affects  the  outcome of implant therapy negatively (i.e. higher failure rate and increased MBLoss) (Chrcanovic et al., 2015); this is probably due to the fact that only a small number of the patients included in this study were smoking. Concerns  about  implant  therapy  in  elderly  regard  not  only  the  early wound healing process but also the capability of the patients to perform proper oral hygiene measures in the long-term, thus preventing peri-implant diseases. In the present study, MBLoss was used as  surrogate  for  peri-implantitis.  The  mean  MBLevel  was  overall  <1.5 mm with an even decreasing tendency for increasing age, that is mean MBLevel and maximum MBLoss of patients ≥80 years of age was only about 0.5 and 1.0 mm, respectively. Indeed, more than two thirds of the implants showed maximum MBLoss< 2 mm and in about one  third  maximum  MBLoss was within 2 and 5 mm; only a single implant was recorded with maximum MBLoss ≥5  mm (Figure 3). Even lower  values  and  a  similar  trend  for  potentially  better  outcomes  in  patients ≥80 years of age were reported in a previous retrospective study (Park et al., 2017). After 2 to 17 years of follow-up, only 71 out of 882 implants showed a mean MBLevel of 2.1 mm. In fact, the mean MBLevel was highest in the age group 65 to 69 years and lowest in patients older than 80 years of age, that is in the latter group none out  of  22  implants  suffered  any  MBLoss.  Furthermore,  the  system-atic review on prospective studies including elderly patients ≥ 65 years  of  age,  already  mentioned  above  (Srinivasan  et  al.,  2017),  reported a MBLoss of 0.7 and 1.5 mm after 5 and 10 years, respectively; however, it is important to note that this data was based only on a single  study  (Hoeksema  et  al.,  2016).  Compared  to  younger  populations (i.e. mean age < 65 years) with at least 5 years of follow-up, more or less comparable values are reported (Roccuzzo et al., 2008; Zetterqvist  et  al.,  2010;  Hasegawa  et  al.,  2016;  den  Hartog  et  al.,  2017).  In  this  context  in  the  present  study,  MBLevel  was  measured  on  radiographs  taken  immediately  after  implant  installation  and  at  last control. Consequently, MBLoss measurements herein include the physiologic bone remodelling occurring after implant installation up to the first year of loading. Considering the results of the 2017 World Workshop on the classification of periodontal and peri-implant diseases and conditions, up to 2 mm of MBLoss might be considered as physiologic  bone  remodelling  (Renvert  et  al.,  2018).  Consequently,  less than 30% of the patients herein might be considered suffering from peri-implant disease. This value is not much different from what was  reported  for  the  prevalence  of  peri-implantitis  in  the  general  population (i.e. 22% but with thresholds for MBLoss varying from >0.4 to > 5 mm) (Derks & Tomasi, 2015), indicating that the elderly are not more prone to this complication compared to younger patients. Nevertheless, even if these results appear encouraging to place implants  in  elderly  patients,  one  should  keep  in  mind,  that  almost  60  and 25% of the current population has been < 70 and < 75 years of age, respectively, at time of implant installation. Thus, approximately 5 years later, most of them were < 80 years of age. Hence, a relevant proportion of the current study population was most likely still able to perform sufficient oral hygiene and follow recommendations and attend follow-ups. In perspective, elderly patients should be closely followed,  contact  to  the  caregivers  sought  and  the  possibility  for  a  back-off  strategy  allowing  later  on—if  necessary—to  switch  to  a  low-maintenance prosthesis kept (Schimmel et al., 2017).In the present study, both panoramic and periapical radiographs were  used.  Previous  studies,  comparing  panoramic  and  periapical  radiographs indicated periapical radiographs as the “gold standard” for measuring MBLevel around dental implants (Kühl et al., 2016; Sirin et al., 2012); however, panoramic radiographs have been described as viable alternative (Gutmacher et al., 2016), especially in cases with implants in the lower anterior region (Zechner et al., 2003). Herein, panoramic radiographs were used at both baseline and at follow-up, for the vast majority of the implants (i.e. 86%); this limits any possible impact on the findings of this study from a potential bias due to using different types of radiographs at different timepoints. In this context, another limitation of the present study was the relatively small number of implant losses; specifically, due to the small number  of  early  (n  =  4)  and  late  (n  =  6)  implant  losses,  a  random-effects  logistic  regression  analysis  was  not  meaningful  and  hence,  the herein recorded potential predictors could neither be related to early nor to late implant loss.In conclusion, the high implant survival rate (95.4%), low mean MBLevel  (1.24  mm)  and  low  frequency  of  maximum  MBLoss ≥ 5 mm (0.5%) observed herein after 5 to 11 years follow-up, suggest that older  age  should  not  be  considered  as  a  limiting  factor  for  implant  treatment.

Exclusion criteria were: (1) an opposing complete denture and(2)  time  in  service.70  months.  A  total  of  37  patients  with  49  prostheses,  including  22  MA,  14  RC,  7  MZ,  and  6  PVZ  prostheses  were recalled.  Patient-reported  outcomes  were  assessed  via  OHIP-49  (Oral  Health  Impact  Profile)  and  a  scripted  interview  with  open-ended questions. All designs had high complication rates (12 of 22 MA, 10 of 14 RC, 2 of 7 MZ, and 5 of 6 PVZ). The most common complications were: (1) MA: posterior tooth wear, (2) RC: chipping and fracturing of the restorations, (3) MZ: wear of opposing restorations, and (4) PVZ:chipping of opposing restorations. Average OHIP-49 scores ranged from 7 to 29, indicating high OHQoL, patient satisfaction, regardless of prosthetic  design  (P¼.16).  The  standardized  interview  highlighted  that  although  most  patients  were  extremely  satisfied  (73%),  some continued to be bothered by material bulk (14%) and felt that maintenance of oral hygiene was excessively time-consuming (16%). In the context  of  this  study,  despite  high  complication  rates  and  maintenance  needs,  all  IFCDP  designs  resulted  in  high  OHQoL  and  patient satisfaction.Key Words: OHIP, oral health-related quality of life, hybrid, chipping, fractures, wear","INTRODUCTION Although  the  prevalence  of  edentulism  in  the  United States  is  declining,  the  absolute  number  of  patients requiring  care  for  complete  edentulism  continues  to increase.1 With   the   established   success   of   dental implants,  implant-supported  fixed  complete  dental  prostheses(IFCDPs)   are   now   routinely   available   as   an   alternative   to traditional  complete  dentures.2–5 Some  authors  even  contend that   an   IFCDP   should   be   considered   the   standard   of   care, particularly  for  the  mandibular  arch  with  limited  osteo mucosal support.6–8 Several prosthetic materials can be used for the fabrication of an IFCDP, the most well-studied of which is the metal–acrylic(MA)  hybrid.9,10 Long-term  follow-up  indicates  that  prosthetic tooth  wear,  tooth  debonding  and  fracture,  and  fracture  of  the veneering  acrylic  complicate  this treatment  modality  such that maintenance  of  the  prosthesis  should  be  expected.10–14 With the   advent   of   computer-assisted   design–computer-assisted milling   (CAD–CAM)   technology,   a   number   of   alternative designs  for  IFCDPs  have  become  feasible,  including  retrievable crown  (RC),  monolithic  zirconia  (MZ),  and  porcelain  veneered zirconia  (PVZ)  prostheses.Retrievable  crown  (RC)  prostheses  involve  cementation  of full coverage restorations onto milled titanium or zirconia bars,which  has  been  suggested  to  allow  for  improved  esthetics, biomechanics,  hygienic  maintenance,  and  long-term  prognosis.15–19 Monolithic  zirconia  has  also  become  popular  for  the fabrication  of  IFCDPs  due  to  its  desirable  chemical  properties,high mechanical strength, and ability to be incorporated into a digital  workflow.20,21 Despite  increased  strength,  catastrophic failures  have  been  reported.22–24 Furthermore,  esthetic  inadequacies of milled zirconia are often corrected using a porcelain veneer  (PVZ),  which  has  a  tendency  to  chip  and  fracture.25–29 Although  techniques  have  been  developed  to  minimize  these complications,17,22,27,30,31 reviews  indicate  that  although  survival  is  generally  high,  veneered  zirconia  can  also  have  a  high incidence  of  mechanical  complications.23,32,33A   complete   evidence-based   evaluation   of   treatment outcomes   must   include   not   only   an   assessment   of   clinical complications,   but   also   an   evaluation   of   patient-centered outcomes.34,35 Although   there   is   no   gold   standard   for determining  patient  satisfaction,34 oral  health-related  quality of life (OHQoL) is the most commonly used measure of patient perception. It is thought to be a more comprehensive, patient-centered   assessment   of   oral   disease   and   therapy   rendered.OHQoL  is  assessed  using  validated  questionnaires,  such  as  the Oral   Health   Impact   Profile   (OHIP).36In   addition,   structured patient  interviews  allow  patients  to  report  qualitative  information   about   their   experiences   and   provide   clinicians   with   a deeper  understanding  of  a  particular  inquiry.  However,  limitedstudies  exist  examining  patient  satisfaction  and  OHQoL  withIFCDPs.22,37–45 Only   1   study   compares   patient   satisfaction across multiple IFCDP designs,46 and no studies have examined the   relationship   between   complications   with   IFCDPs   and patient  satisfaction.The purpose of this study was to identify: (1) the incidence of complications associated with MA, RC, MZ, and PVZ implant-supported  fixed  complete  dental  prostheses,  (2)  the  types  of complications  intrinsic  to each, (3) patient  satisfaction  and oral health-related  quality  of  life  (OHQoL)  measures  between  the various  IFCDP  designs,  and  (4)  the  relationship  between  the occurrence  of  prosthetic  complications  and  OHQoL.MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design and subjects This  study  protocol  (#2015-0445)  was  reviewed  and  approved by  the Institutional Review Board  of the University of Illinois at Chicago  (UIC).  All  patients  who  received  an  IFCDP  at  the  UIC Advanced  Prosthodontics  program  at  least  1  year  prior  to  the date  of  recall  were  identified.  Patients  were  included  if  they provided  voluntary  consent  to  participate  in  the  survey  andexam  and  if  their  prosthesis  had  been  in  place  for  longer  than 12 months. Patients were excluded if the prosthesis had been inservice  for  more  than  70  months  or  if  the  prosthesis  was  in occlusion with a conventional removable complete denture. Asno  RC,  MZ,  or  PVZ  prostheses  had  been  in  service  for.70 months, MA prostheses older than 70 months were excluded to reduce  the  effect  of  prosthesis  age  as  a  confounding  variable.Similarly,   no   RC,   MZ,   or   PVZ   prostheses   were   identified opposing  a  conventional  complete  denture.  Therefore,  all  MA prostheses  opposing  a  complete  denture  were  excluded.  All prostheses   included   in   this   study   opposed   another   IFCDP,natural  dentition,  or  an  implant-supported  removal  prosthesis.This study was conducted from September 1, 2015 through March  1,  2016.  The  face-to-face  interview  method  was  used both  to  reduce  the  risk  of  bias 47 and  also  to  allow  for  clinical evaluation of the prosthesis. All patients were evaluated by the same  provider  (VHB)  using  a  structured  assessment  protocol.Questionnaire and exam Following written consent, the patients completed the OHIP-49 questionnaire.   OHIP-49   is   one   of   the   most   commonly   used instruments   for   measuring   OHQoL.   It   is   comprised   of   7 subscales   that   evaluate   impairment,   including   functional limitation,   physical   pain,   psychological   discomfort,   physical disability, psychological  disability,  and social disability.  Patients respond to questions using a 5-point Likert scale coded from 0¼‘‘never’’ to 4¼‘‘very often.’’ Thus, the total score ranges from 0  to  196;  the  closer  the  score  is  to  0,  the  better  the  patient’sOHQoL. Perhaps the most important aspect of OHIP-49 is that it has  been  validated  and  demonstrates  high  internal  reliability and   test–retest   reliability.48–50 Patients   were   instructed   to answer   the   each   OHIP-49   question   as   it   pertained   to   their experience  since  the  final  prosthesis  was  inserted.  If  patients had  opposing  IFCDPs,  they  were  asked  to  complete  separate OHIP-49  questionnaires  for  each  prosthesis.The   patients   were   then   interviewed   using   a   pre written script  of  6  questions  developed  from  a  literature  review  and expert  opinions.  The  interviews  usually  lasted  5  to  15  minutes,and  the  patients  were  not  queued  in  any  direction  regarding their   responses.   The   interviews   were   recorded   and   later transcribed.  To  provide  a  meaningful  summary,  the  responses were  minimally  condensed.  Responses  were  compiled  around direct  quotes  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.An   intraoral   exam   was   then   performed   and   prosthetic complications  assessed  in  the  categories:  biologic  and  prosthetic (divided into technical and patient-directed; Table 1). The percentage of prostheses free from complications at the time of recall   was   determined,   not   including   complications   to   the opposing  arch.  ‘‘Prosthetic  failure’’  was  defined  as  complications   severe   enough   that   remake   of   the   prosthesis   was recommended  by  the  provider.Data analysis Statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  SPSS  (v.20,  Chicago,Ill)  with  significance  levels  set  atP,.05.  A  2-sided  Fisher's Exact test was used to determine significance between varying complication  rates  among  materials.  For  patient  satisfaction  as assessed   by   OHIP,   median   scores   were   compared   using   nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test, as the data was found to be not  normally  distributed  according  to  the  Shapiro–Wilk  test.Differences between median OHIP-49 scores for each prosthetic material   were   calculated.   Pairwise   comparisons   between prosthetic   groups   were   performed   using   Mann–Whitney   U tests.  Multivariate  linear  regression  analysis  was  performed  to assess  the  relationship  between  the  occurrence  of  complications   and   a   patient’s   reported   OHIP   score.   Incidence   of responses  to  patient  interview  questions  was  reported  across prosthetic  designs. RESULTS General characteristics (Table 2)In  total,  37  patients  with  49  prostheses  (25  single  arch;  24 double  arch)  met  the  inclusion  criteria  and  presented  to  the clinic  for  dental  examination.  Specific  details  are  provided  in Table  2.Complications (Table 3)BiologicNo   participants   lost   implants   or   displayed   radiographic pathology  other  than  marginal  bone  loss.  One  maxillary  MAIFCDP  and  3  maxillary  RCs  demonstrated  radiographic  bone loss  greater  than  1/3  the  length  of  the  implant,  none  of  which resulted  in  implant  or  prosthetic  failure.Prosthetic Four  of  13  patients  with  zirconia  prostheses  presented  with  a chief  complaint  of  loss  of  a  screw  access  plug  (P¼.01).  Not  all screws   could   be   accessed   for   looseness   due   to   crown cementation   over   implant   access   holes   in   RC   prostheses.However,  no  patients  presented  with  prosthesis  mobility  due to  loose  or  fractured  screws.  Two  prostheses  (1  MA;  1  PVZ)demonstrated   marked   anterior   wear.   Both   were   mandibular prostheses  that  were  deemed  ‘‘failures’’  due  to  an  excessive number   of   tooth   fractures.   Posterior   wear,   observed   as obliteration  of  the  central  groove  anatomy  of  at  least  1  tooth,was  the  most  commonly  noted  complication  overall  (10  of  22 MA;   3   of   14   RC;   1   of   7   MZ;   2   of   6   PVZ   prostheses).   The Monolithic  zirconia  prosthesis  identified  as  having  wear  was opposing implant-supported single-unit restorations, and the 2PVZ prostheses identified with wear were opposing each other.The  second  most  commonly  noted  complication  was  chipping and  fracturing  of  teeth  (4  of  22  MA;  6  of  14  RC;  3  of  6  PVZ prostheses).  Additionally,  4  of  the  RC  prostheses  had  complications categorized as ‘‘debonding.’’ Three had lost portions of the   composite   gingiva   (Figure   1)   and   2   had   crowns   that debonded  from  the  frameworks  (Figure  2).Functional Patients   who   were   dissatisfied   with   the   esthetics   of   their prostheses  (2  of  22  MA  and  1  of  6  PVZ)  stated  that  they  felt their  provider  had  not  listened  or  been  able  to  achieve  the aesthetics they desired. One patient with a MA prosthesis and 2 patients  with  RC  prostheses  felt  that  their  speech  had  been affected  and  did  not  resolve  to  their  satisfaction  over  time.Complication incidence (Figure 3)Overall,  MZ  had  the  lowest  complication  rate  (Figure  4),  while PVZ  prostheses  had  the  highest  with  only  1  of  6  prostheses being  entirely  complication-free. Complications to the Opposing Arch (Table 4)The  frequency  of  wear  to  the  opposing  dentition  with  MA  (4  of 22)  and  RC  (3  of  14)  prostheses  was  similar.  This  complication seemed  to  occur  with  greater  frequency  for  zirconia  prostheses with (3 of 6) and without (2 of 7) porcelain veneer, but the trend was  not  statistically  significant  (P¼.155).  Tooth  fracture  in  the opposing arch was also common. Two of the MA, 2 of the RC, and2 of the PVZ prostheses with fractures were in patients with both upper  and  lower  prostheses  which  were  deemed  to have  failed.Prosthetic failures Six prostheses  in  3  patients  were deemed prosthetic  failures;  2MA prostheses opposing each other (Figure 5), 2 PVZ opposing each other (Figure 6), and 2 RC prostheses opposing each other(Figure 7). All of the failures were due to excessive chipping and fracturing  of  the  prosthetic  teeth.  No  MZ  prostheses  failed  for any  reason.Oral health-related quality of life Average  OHQoL  scores  were  low  across  all  prosthetic  groups,indicating   that   patients   had   an   excellent   OHQoL   and   were satisfied.  The  differences  between  prosthetic  groups  were  not statistically  significant  (P¼.16).  Patients  with  PVZ  prostheses reported the most complications that negatively impacted their OHQoL,  with  an  average  total  score  of  29  (Figure  8).  Patients with MZ prostheses reported the lowest score with an average of  7.  The  7  OHIP-49  categories  were  also  analyzed  separately. The  average  scores  were  less  than  1  (1¼‘‘hardly  ever’’)  perquestion  in  every  category  and  for  every  prosthetic  material,with  the  exception  of  patients  with  MZV  prostheses  in  the functional   limitation   category.   In   this   category   the   average score  per  question  was  1.18  (Figure  9).  Across  all  prosthetic groups,  patients  ranked  functional  limitation  as  causing  the greatest disturbance to their OHQoL and psychological or social disability  as  the  least.  The  trend  in  each  of  the  seven  OHIP-49 categories was that patients with MZ prostheses had the lowest scores,   the   fewest   complaints,   and   the   greatest   overall satisfaction.Patient interviews (Table 5)The   findings   from   the   patient   interviews   confirmed   that patients  were  generally  satisfied  to  very  satisfied  with  their therapy and thought their prostheses ‘‘looked great.’’ However,the results also highlighted that IFCDPs can have an impact on food  selection  and  speech.  Patients  also  perceived  difficulty maintaining good oral hygiene and may be bothered by excess material  bulk  even  more  than  1  year  after  prosthesis  delivery.Relationship between complications and OHIP scores(Figure 10)The overall correlation between OHQoL, as determined by total OHIP-49 score and the incidence of complications was assessed using  multivariate  linear  regression.  The  number  of  complications  was  not  found  to  be  a  predictor  of  OHQoL. DISCUSSION Metal–acrylic No  implants  failed  in  the  course  of  this  study,  and  technical complications  were  noted  more  often  than  biologic,  with  over half  of  the  prostheses  (29  of  49)  having  at  least  1  technical complication. For MA prostheses, the most common complication observed in this study was posterior tooth wear, with 10 of22   of   prostheses   displaying   wear   after   only   21   months   in function.  One  similar  study  found  that  tooth  replacement  dueto  wear  was  required  in  22  of  46  prostheses  after  5  years,12 whereas  another  found  that  8  of  46  patients  required  full-arch tooth  replacement  10  times  over  an  average  follow-up  period of 8 years and 3 months.13 One reason the results of this study may  indicate  a  higher  incidence  of  wear  is  that  many  studies that   evaluate   wear   with   MA   IFCDPs   use   full-arch   teeth replacement,   also   known   as   retreading 51as   the   endpoint.However,  the literature  shows  that  full-arch  tooth  replacement is usually only necessary after 5 to 10 years in service.12,13,51 Duo to   the   shortened   duration   of   follow-up   for   this   study,   a definition  of  wear  that  could  be  objectively  assessed  and  that would   be   visible   within   the   duration   of   the   study   was established.   It   is   important   to   note   that   this   endpoint   is different from that which is generally used in medium- to long-term  studies,  and  there  is  no  documentation  regarding  what percentage  of  these  patients  with  posterior  tooth  wear  will later  require  full-arch  tooth  replacement.Another  important  factor  that  contributes  to  the  risk  of complications  is  the  nature  of  the  opposing  dentition  and/or prosthesis.52 It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  incidence  of complications for prostheses opposing implant-supported fixed prostheses or natural dentition can be dramatically higher than for  prostheses  which  oppose  complete  dentures.52 All  prostheses   included   in   this   study   opposed   natural   dentition,another   implant-supported   fixed   prosthesis,   or   an   implant-supported  removable  prosthesis.  Therefore,  the  risk  of  complications indicated by this study is likely to be higher than that of many  studies,  which  include  prostheses  opposing  traditional complete  dentures.9,13,14,53–56 Another commonly noted complication, tooth fracture, was seen in 4 of 22 of MA prostheses. This is similar to the findings of Gothberg  et  al53who  noted  that  fractures  of  the  resin  matrix, including of the acrylic resin teeth, were noted in 17 of 75 patients after 3 years. This is also corroborated by Purcell et al,12who foundthat 9 teeth broke in 46 prostheses within a 2-year time frameOne  interesting finding  of this  study  was that  no  instancesof chipping or fracturing of the acrylic gingiva were noted with MA  prostheses.  This  finding  is  different  from  several  studies that reported resin veneer fracture to be a prevalent, if not the most  prevalent,  prosthetic  complication.9,10,55,56 Two  potential reasons  for  this  difference  are  that  all  prostheses  included  in this  study  were  delivered  in  an  academic  environment  with careful attention paid to ensure adequate prosthetic space and that all prostheses had a milled titanium bar substructure rather than  a  cast  framework.Retrievable crown The  most  common  complication  observed  in  the  retrievable crown  prostheses  included  in  this  study  was  chipping  and  or fracturing   of   at   least   1   restoration   (occurring   in   6   of   14 prostheses),  all  of  which  were  porcelain-fused-metal  restorations. This is similar to the results of Malo ́et al who found that mechanical  complications  occurred  in  27  or  55%  of  prostheses restored  with  bilayer  all-ceramic  restorations,  most  of  which were   chipping   and   fracturing   of   the   crowns.15 However,   it should   be   noted   that   several   reports   have   been   published using  monolithic  lithium  disilicate  restorations  cemented  onto a   milled   bar,   with   marked   improvement   in   mechanical complications.16,18 Monolithic zirconia For  MZ  prostheses,  the  most  common  complication  noted  in this study was wear of the opposing arch (2 of 7). This study is one  of  the  first  to  examine  clinically  wear  opposing  full-arch zirconia  restorations.  Although  in  vitro  studies  indicate  that well-polished   zirconia   can   result   in   very   little   wear   to   the opposing  arch,  the  few  clinical  studies  that  exist  on  this  topic demonstrate  mixed  results.57,58 If  the  results  of  this  study  are consistent  in  larger  sample  sizes,  it  could  indicate  that  either zirconia is not being polished ideally in routine clinical practice or that in vitro studies may not be adequately modeling clinical ware.Porcelain-veneered zirconia With PVZ prostheses, chipping and fracturing of the porcelain veneer   was   a   commonly   noted   complication   (3   of   6 prostheses).   Early   studies   on   full-arch   porcelain-veneered zirconia   noted   similar   or   worse   findings.   For   instance,   in2010  Larsson  et  al  noted  that  9  out  of  10  prostheses  chipped within  the  first  3  years.28 These  results  might  indicate  that patient  and  provider  desires  for  esthetic  translucency  leading to the selection of laminated zirconia can place the patient at risk  of  chipping.  However,  more  recent  studies  on  PVZ  have indicated   that   with   proper   cutback   design   and   laboratory protocols,   incidence   of   complications   may   be   dramatically reduced.27,30Many   laboratory   protocols   have   recently changed   as   a   result   of   the   chipping   identified   in   earlier studies. The incidence reported in this study may indicate the laboratories  had  not  yet  adopted  the  developing  changes  in processing.   It   may   also   indicate   that   in   the   real   world,laboratories  may  not  be  complying  with  the  extended  firing cycles  now  being  recommended.Oral health-related quality of life The  most  important  finding  from  the  overall  OHIP-49  score was  that  the  average  patient  had  a  very  high  OHQoL,  patient satisfaction,   regardless   of   the   prosthetic   material   selected.Average OHIP-49 scores among prosthetic designs ranged from 7 to 29, which is consistent with Limmer et al.22Limmer et al is the  only  study  to  publish  patient  satisfaction  data  with  MZIFCDPs and found that 12 months after enrollment in the study,the   average   OHIP-49   score   was   18   after   having   completed therapy   with   mandibular   monolithic   zirconia   IFCDPs.   The Studies   that   examine   MA   IFCDPs   have   used   OHIP-14,37,39,40 and  have  reported  correspondingly  low  OHIP-14  scores,  also indicating high OHQoL. No studies have examined OHQoL witheither   RC   or   PVZ   prostheses.   No   statistically   significant differences   were   noted   in   oral   health-related   quality   of   life among the different prosthetic designs (P¼.16), indicating that in  the  context  of  this  study,  all  designs  provided  a  treatment solution  which  satisfied  patient  expectations.  Analysis  of  the individual  subsections  of  the  OHIP-49  questionnaire  found  a trend  that  functional  limitation  was  the  most  important  factor for   all   groups   when   measured   as   an   average   value   per questions.  Similarly,  other  recent  articles  indicate  that  patients with MA and MZ prostheses noted the greatest reduction in the categories   of   functional   limitation,   pain,   and   psychological discomfort.22,39 Effect of complications on oral health-related quality of life In this study the number of complications was not found to be a  predictor  of  the  patient’s  OHQoL,  overall  satisfaction.  This Differs   from   some   implant-supported   overdenture   studies,which   have   found   a   relationship   between   patients’   OHQoL and therapeutic efficacy, functionality, and comfort, particularly during  speech  and  mastication.7,59,60 Additionally,  it  has  been demonstrated  with  implant-supported  overdentures  that  ongoing  maintenance  such  as  relining,  adjustments,  and  chang-ing   the   nylon   retentive   elements   negatively   impact   patient well-being.34In  contrast,  a  recent  systematic  review  of  patient satisfaction  with  conventional  complete  dentures  notes  that there is limited data to support a correlation between technical specifications   of   the   denture   and   reported   patient   satisfaction.61 Instead,   psychosocial   factors,   such   as   the   patient's relationship  with   the  prosthodontist   and  patient   self-image,including   the   patient’s   perception   of   esthetics   and   speech,cannot   be   underestimated.61–63 Additionally,   socioeconomic factors,  such  as  employment  status  and  level  of  education,  as well  as  patient  age  and  prior  dental  experiences  have  been found  to  play  an  important  role  in  patient  satisfaction  with complete dentures.35,60,64–66 These factors could play a similarly important  role  in  patient  satisfaction  with  IFCDPs,  and  might obscure  a  possible  relationship  between  patient  satisfaction and  complications.Patient interview For  the  novel  patient  interview,  the  questions  were  open-ended.  Therefore,  patient  responses  were  open-ended  and varied  in  focus  based  on  individual  patient  experiences.  To Summarize   effectively,   responses   were   pooled   across   all material  types.  Most  patients  were  very  (14%)  to  extremely satisfied  (73%)  with  their  therapy  and  thought  their  prostheses  ‘‘looked  great’’  (89%),  which  is  consistent  with  previously published  studies  (Table  3).39,40In  this  study,  some  patients mentioned difficulty  adjusting  to  the  material  bulk  (14%)  and frustration  with  food  entrapment  in  the  space  between  the prosthesis   and   the   natural   gingiva   that   went   beyond   a hygiene  issue  (8%).  A  similar  concern  was  addressed  by  Ohet  al  who  found  that  13.8%  of  patients  were  dissatisfied  with the  way  foreign  substances  got  caught  under  their  prosthesis.39 Most patients  (84%)  felt that chewing  with their prosthesis was   satisfactory,   which   is   consistent   with   other   clinical reports.39,40A third of patients felt that they could eat anything they wanted (34%), which was not mutually exclusive from the group of  patients  (38%)  who  actively  tried  to avoid  foods  they perceived   as   hard   (ice,   popcorn,   nuts)   and   more   likely   to damage   their   prostheses.   Unlike   other   reports,   no   patients noted  any  disruption  of  meals40or  problems  with  chewing trauma  to  the  lips  and  cheeks.39In  terms  of  the  effect  of  the  prostheses  on  speech,  a  wide variety of responses existed, ranging from ‘‘I have no problems’’to  ‘‘I  had  problems  initially,  but  am  fine  now’’  to  ‘‘I  still  have  to focus  on  speaking  clearly.’’  Only  a  small  percentage  of  patients(5%,  Table  3)  felt  that  they  were  still  not  able  to  speak  clearly,whereas some (14%) said that their speech had actually improved since  initiating  therapy.  Oh  et  al 39 reported  100%  satisfaction with ‘‘comfort during pronunciation.’’ Martı ́n-Ares et al 40 reported that   patients   hardly   ever   had   difficulty   pronouncing   certain words, and had significantly fewer problems with pronunciation than patients with complete dentures or overdentures.Regarding  hygiene  of  the  prostheses,  many  patients  (59%,Table  3)  commented  that  a  Waterpik  helped  significantly  in keeping their prostheses clean. Many patients (54%) commented  that  they  did  not  feel  that  cleaning  their  prosthesis  was particularly  challenging  or  onerous,  although  some  (16%)  did mention   that   this   took   approximately   15–20   minutes   daily.According to Martı ́n-Ares et al, difficulty cleaning the prosthesis was the patient’s biggest complaint with IFCDPs. Even still, they noted  that  these  concerns  arose  infrequently.40 Limitations The outcomes of this study reflect multiple providers treating patients  according  to  their  individual  needs,  rather  than  a prescribed   study   protocol.   This   may   have   allowed   the introduction  of  clinician  bias  in  planning  prosthetic  design and   material   selection,   potentially   reducing   the   reported complications  for  MA  and  PVZ  prostheses,  in  particular.  If  a patient  had  certain  characteristics  that  the  provider  might assume put the patient at risk for complications (ie, history of bruxism,  young  age,  male  gender,  low  Frankfort-mandibular plane  angle,  prior  history  of  complications),  he  or  she  might have   been   planned   for   a   more   durable   MZ   prosthesis.Additionally,   if   the   provider   noticed   a   large   number   of acrylic   tooth   fractures   during   the   provisional   phase,   a different   prosthetic   material   may   have   been   selected   for the   final   prosthesis.   Therefore,   MA,   and   possibly   PVZ prosthesis  could  have  had  a  greater  incidence  of  complications   if   the   patients   had   been   randomized   for   prosthesis design.   Although   this   lack   of   randomization   and   the influence   of   provider   bias   may   raise   concern   regarding comparisons  of  complications  among  prosthetic  materials,the data indicates that in an appropriate patient population,MA  prostheses  can  result  in  acceptable  clinical  performance and  high  patient  satisfaction.One potential shortcoming of this study was that it did not assess  the  percentage  of  patients  who  routinely  wore  their occlusal  guards.  Although  it  was  frequently  mentioned  in  the patient  interview  section  regarding  TMJ  concerns,  routine  use of  occlusal  guards  was  not  quantified  in  any  other  way  in  this study.   A   more   thorough   assessment   of   occlusal   guard   use might  have  helped  to  understand  the  incidence  of  technical complications,   including   wear   and   fracture   of   both   the prosthesis   and   the   opposing   arch.   Practice   guidelines   now recommend  such  use  when  indicated  by  clinical  signs.67 Due   to   the   retrospective   nature   of   this   study,   another limitation  was  difficulty  differentiating  between  certain  complications  of  interest  (eg,  occlusal  wear)  and  iatrogenic  causes(eg,  occlusal  adjustments).  Additionally,  the  prostheses  includ-ed  in  this  study  were  fabricated  by  multiple  laboratories  with varying  techniques.  Lastly,  it  is  important  to  note  the  small sample  sizes  for  several  of  the  study  groups  included  in  this paper,   particularly   MZ   and   PVZ   prostheses.   Therefore,   the conclusions  of  this  paper  should  be  considered  as  preliminary,pilot  study  outcomes  that  need  to  be  corroborated  by  future studies  performed  with  larger  sample  sizes.CONCLUSION This retrospective study evaluated clinical and patient-centered experiences  with  MA,  RC,  MZ,  and  PVZ  prosthetic  designs.  It  is the first to report clinical OHQoL and patient satisfaction across multiple  IFCDP  prosthetic  designs  and  relate  it  to  the  rate  of complications.  Results  demonstrate  overall  patient  satisfaction and high OHQoL across  all prosthetic designs. However, futurewell-controlled   prospective   clinical   trials   are   needed   to corroborate   our   pilot   results   regarding   the   influence   of prosthetic  design  on  patient-centered  outcomes.  Within  the limitations   of   this   study,   the   following   conclusions   can   be made:1.  Complications   rates   were   high   and   varied   based   on prosthetic  design  and  material.2.  Monolithic  zirconia  had  the  lowest  incidence  of  complications.3.  Patients  were  satisfied  with  their  prostheses  regardless  of prosthesis  design  and  rate/occurrence  of  complications.4.  No difference in OHQoL was noted among patient-centered domains  using  OHIP-49.5.  Although  patient  interviews  reported  favorable  outcomes,results   indicate   IFCDPs   can   have   an   impact   on   food selection,  speech,  and  patient-perceived  difficulty  maintaining  oral  hygiene.

NUTRITION IN THE ELDERLY,"Gordon L. Jensen, MD, PhD, Melissa McGee, MS, RD, and Jeff Binkley, PharmD, BCNSP","Nutrition and health are major concerns for older persons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that by 2050, 1 in 5 Americans will be 65 years  old  or 0lder.4~ Among the fastest  growing  segments of the population are the oldest old, those aged 85 years and older. With aging comes a  growing burden of chronic  disease and  health care  resource use. Nutrition affects many of the chronic disease processes that afflict older persons. Changes in physiology, metabolism, and function that accompany aging result in altered nutritional requirements. Better understanding of these changes and familiarity with nutritional screening, assessment, and interventions can guide practitioners to provide the best possible care for older persons. ","CHANGES WITH AGING Body Composition and Organ Functions Aging is associated with changes in body composition. Most characteristic is  a decline in skeletal muscle mass called su~copeniu.~~~ 6o Many older persons also exhibit an increase in total body fat with greater intra-abdominal (visceral) fat stores.48 Abdominal adiposity has been linked to the development of  coronary artery disease,  dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance.~~ Novak~~ studied 500 men and women, aged 18 to 85 years, and observed that body fat increased  from 18% in younger men  to 36% in  older men and from 33% in younger women  to 44% in older women. The consequence of these changes in body  composition is that well-standardized nutrient requirements for younger or middle-aged adults cannot be generalized to older adults. The aging  process affects multiple organ functions (Table 1). A decline in organ  function  may affect nutritional assessment and  intervention. Although it  has been suggested that changes in gastrointestinal  function are modest, gastrointestinal changes with aging can affect nutrient intake and assimilation. Poor appetite and hunger, reduced  appreciation for food, and diminished physical activity encompass the anorexia of aging.16, 73 This term may be particularly applicable to institutionalized frail subjects who often exhibit a  decline in food intake. Studies have  yielded conflicting results  as to whether food intake is  actually  reduced among healthy  older persons  in comparison with  their younger counterparts. Older persons may not increase food intake appropriately after deprivation.g0, 93 A diminished sense of smell and altered taste perception can blunt  appetite  and  the enjoyment of eating. For most  persons, olfactory discrimination  is  decreased substantially by age 70.24 The discrimination of sweet, sour, bitter, and salty tastes is impaired?z Notable aging changes in the oral cavity may  affect nutritional status adversely 108 Teeth become stained  and  worn  down. Roots become fragile and susceptible to  fracture. Periodontal  disease  is common. Tooth loss  is the  end result. An edentulous state or ill-fitting dentures can make chewing difficult. An older person  cannot open his or her mouth as widely  or chew as strongly as a younger person. This change likely reflects a decrease in the mass of the muscles of mastication. The tongue loses muscle  mass with aging, but this  does not appear to limit swallowing or phonation in  healthy individuals. Of older  persons, 40% complain of dry mouth.63 Although there is a loss of secretory parenchyma in the salivary glands, there does not appear to be a decline in stimulated salivation. Factors that  contribute to a  dry mouth may include medical conditions,  medications, compromised  fluid intake, and dehydration. Although the oral cavity often is overlooked in the nutritional assessment of older persons, it is important. Sullivan et aP7 found that the number of general oral problems is a strong predictor of involuntary weight loss. Many such problems are amenable to simple interventions. Modest changes in esophageal motility were revealed in swallowing studies of many otherwise asymptomatic  older persons.121 (See also the article on ”Esophageal Diseases in  the Elderly,” p. 335.) These findings may  include decreased upper and lower esophageal sphincter pressures with a reduced  amplitude of   peristaltic contractions, incomplete sphincter relaxation, delayed esophageal   emptying, frequent   tertiary contractions, and esophageal dilation.~ Alterations in esophageal motility may  relate  to a  reduction in the  number of neurons in the myenteric plexus that occurs with aging. A clinically significant impairment in esophageal motility generally is  observed  only in the setting of an  underlying pathologic  condition, such as diabetes mellitus or neurologic disease.Ioo With the exception of chronic atrophic gastritis,  gastric acid secretion, whether basal or stimulated,  appears to be  preserved  with aging. (See also article on “Acid  Peptic Disorders in  the Elderly,” p. 363.) Type A  atrophic gastritis is  relatively uncommon (<5% of persons >60 years old) and may  be associated with  antiparietal cell and anti-intrinsic  factor  antibodies and  pernicious anemia.” Type B atrophic gastritis is commoner (>25% of persons >60 y old) and is associated with non autoimmune conditions.” Helicobacter pylori has been detected in many persons with  atrophic  gastritis  and hypochlorhydria; what has long been  considered a normal part of the aging process may be due to H. pylori infection.lo5 Aging is associated with an increased risk of  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ga~tropathy.~~ Although older  persons  use NSAIDs with increased frequency, it  is likely that  impaired mucosal defenses also play a  role.  Mucosal prostaglandin  synthesis declines, and secretion of bicarbonate, sodium ion, and non parietal fluids is decreased. Impaired  gastric  motility and emptying are  observed with aging.”, 131 Asymptomatic older persons exhibit a delayed gastric emptying time for mixed meals in comparison with younger adults.  Underlying disease processes that affect autonomic nervous system  function  may  result in symptomatic impairment of gastric emptying. The structure and  absorptive function of the small  intestine appear to be well preserved with aging.61 (See also the article on ”Diarrhea and Malabsorption in the Elderly,” p. 427.) Enterocyte height appears to be relatively unchanged. Brush-border enzyme activity for  glucose transport is  maintained.130 Although lactase activity commonly declines, sucrase and maltase activities are unaffected. Small intestinal integrity  appears to  remain  intact, and lactose and mannitol absorption tests remain within normal limits.lo6 Vitamin BIZ absorption generally is adequate except in  the  setting of atrophic ga~tritis.~,~~ It appears  that fat absorption is not compromised at  usual levels of fat  consumption.6 Frank fat malabsorption is unusual and reflects underlying pathology in  biliary, pancreatic, or intestinal function. Absorption of zinc may fall with age, but overall zinc balance is unchanged because of a decreased rate of excretion.’26 Absorption of calcium declines and may contribute to the  high prevalence of osteoporosis among older persons.1z,35 Contributing factors may include atrophic gastritis and poor vitamin D intake, as well as a fall in active intestinal transport of calcium and a reduction in the number of vitamin D receptors. The motility of the small intestine is well preserved.~ (See also the article on ”Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in  the Elderly,” p. 517.) Orocecal transit times are  similar in older and younger subjects.& All phases of the  migrating motor  complex are maintained with only modest changes in the  amplitude of contraction P Underlying neurologic and infiltrative disease processes can result in clinically relevant compromise in motility. The weight of the pancreas  declines with aging, and histologic changes include ductal epithelial hyperplasia and lobular  fibrosis.5~ (See the article on ”Pancreatic and Biliary Diseases in the Elderly,” p. 531.) Despite these morphologic changes, the exocrine functions of the pancreas appear to remain adequate and do not result in absorptive compromise, unless there is underlying disease with associated pancreatic The colon  may undergo many structural changes that adversely affect tensile strength and function with aging. (See also the article on “Diverticular Disease in the Elderly,” p. 475.) Increased numbers of collagen, elastic, elaunin, and oxytalan fibers are observed in the colonic wall. Neuronal density declines. This may explain why diverticulosis is  commoner in the  elderly than  in  the young. Studies that have examined colonic transit time as a function of age have yielded conflicting results.7o (See also the article on ”Constipation and Fecal Incontinence in the Elderly,” p. 497.) Postprandial augmentation of mass movements and segmental  contractions of the colon are similar in all  age  groups, however. Other factors that affect colonic transit, such as dietary intake, medications, disease, and inactivity, must be considered caref~dly.~ Self-report of constipation increases with age and is  more prevalent among women.39, ‘~5 Laxative use follows the same age and gender trends. There is an increased frequency of fecal incontinence among older persons. The rectal pressure threshold that elicits the sensation of rectal filling has been observed to increase with age? Contributing factors to incontinence may include decreased rectal elasticity, thickening of the internal anal sphincter, and  impairment of anal canal resting and maximal squeeze pressures.6s Nonetheless, many persons with clinically significant fecal incontinence have other contributing factors, including previous bowel surgery, diabetes mellitus, or dementia. ’ Energy Requirements A reduced basal metabolic rate (BMR) in older persons seems to be  associated largely with loss of   muscle mass. Because Bh4R is the principal determinant of total  energy  expenditure,  energy  requirements must  be  adjusted for older persons. The presence  or absence of disease states  and  the highly  variable contribution of physical  activity are  important factors. Tzankoff and Norris~~~ found that  an age-related decline in BMR was  almost  entirely attributable to sarcopenia. Klausen et alB measured 24-hour energy expenditure using whole- body  calorimetry in healthy adults  during a  5-year period  and  found  that  the mean BMR was 4.6% lower in  the middle-aged group (50-65 y  old,  n = 39) than  in  the younger group (20-29 y  old,  n = 98), even  after adjusting for differences in body composition and physical activity. Starling et a1115 studied the  determinants of daily total energy  expenditure  and free-living  physical activity in older white  men and women and  found that  the strongest independent predictors of physical activity energy expenditure were maximum oxygen consumption, fat-free mass, and body mass, regardless of gender. After adjustment for body  composition, there were no significant gender differences in total energy expenditure, BMR, or physical activity energy expenditure. The 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for energy for men and women 51 years  old or older  is 126 kJ/kg/d (30 kcal/kg/d).n The Food and Nutrition Board convened an expert panel  to re-examine macronutrient requirements, so new  recommendations  may be forthcoming. Factors that  should be considered when  determining  energy  needs  for  older  persons  include  physical activity, current  medical diagnoses, social situation, and individual  patient concerns. As research evidence  mounts,  it  is  becoming  more  apparent  that  the energy needs of the older person  should be determined  individually. The Harris-Benedict equations differ by  gender and may be used  to predict the  basal  energy  expenditure (BEE) of older  persons (Box l).40 These formulas were  derived from indirect calorimetric studies of healthy  younger adults and take into account age (y), weight (kg), and height (cm). The BEE may be adjusted for perceived stress by using empirical stress factors (in a range of 1.00-1.76) to calculate total  energy needs.  Reports suggest that stress factors of 1.00 to 1.55 may match closely indirect calorimetric measurements of resting energy expenditure for many  older persons who are In any consideration of energy needs for older persons, care must be taken  to  avoid  overfeeding, while still meeting basal requirements. Macronutrient Requirements Modified  food guide pyramids have been released for older  persons using the US. Department of Agriculture (USDA) food guide pyramid model. 4, 101 The food selections have  been  adjusted  to be relevant  to  the  older  target  audience, and appropriate intakes of   water; fiber; and supplements of calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin BI2 are provided. Requirements for protein  have been  based  largely on nitrogen  balance studies  rather than maintenance of muscle  mass. The RDA for protein for individuals  aged 51 years and older is 0.8 g/kg body weight/d,n  but some authors now recommend 1.0 g/kg body weight/d or higher.14 Protein in the diet generally approximates 10% to 20% of total  energy intake, regardless of age.I0 Among community-dwelling older adults, median protein intakes tend to exceed the RDA.lo3 Protein needs in acute stress or chronic illness are less well characterized.  Inadequate intake,  bed  rest, injury, or  infection may result in negative nitrogen  balance. Certain diseases, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency, may necessitate protein restriction. In general, hospitalized  older patients  without signs of  protein intolerance warrant a protein intake of 1.5 g/kg of  body weight/ d if  under stressful conditions (see previous The Dietary Guidelines for Americans lB do not make specific macronutrient recommendations for older  persons but provide  general recommendations for any age group. It  is suggested that no more than 30% of total energy come from fat, with no more than 10% from saturated fat sources. Fat serves as a key source of energy and of essential fatty acids as well as a  vehicle for transporting fat- soluble vitamins. Many undernourished older  persons  insist  on following  ill- ,advised low-fat diets even when in dire need of increased energy intake. Carbohydrates are another key source of energy for the body and provide fiber in the diet. Energy obtained from carbohydrates should approximate 55% to 60% of total caloric intake per day, with a greater emphasis on complex carbohydrates than on simple sugars.'% Micronutrient Requirements Revisions to the Dietary Reference Intakes offer RDAs with more specific guidelines for older  person^.^^^-^^^ For the first time, the RDAs have been split into two groups, those for persons  aged 51 to 70 years and those for persons older than age 70. Recommendations for selected nutrients have been adjusted in view of new  research findings, including  changes in recommendations for calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin D, fluoride, thiamine, riboflavin, nia- cin, vitamin Bc folate, vitamin BIZ, pantothenic acid, choline, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium. Table 2 highlights the newest changes in the RDAs for older Americans. Fluid Requirements Fluid requirements warrant close attention because dehydration is  a  common fluid or electrolyte disturbance among older persons. The aging process is associated with  a decreased perception of thirst,  impaired  response  to  serum osmolarity, and reduced  ability  to  concentrate urine after  fluid deprivation.~~ Compromised fluid intake can result from disease states that cause a reduction in a person's mental or  physical  ability to recognize  or  express thirst or in decreased access to water.71 In general, fluid needs of older persons may be met with 30 mL/kg body weight/d, or 1 mL/kcal consumed. Fluid needs may be increased during episodes of fever  or  infection and with the administration of diuretics or laxatives. In assessing an elderly  patient,  signs of dehydration  should be noted, including  a  decreased urine  output, elevated body temperature,  constipation, mucosal dryness, skin turgor changes, and mental  confusion.  Altered fluid status, either overhydration or under hydration, may  affect anthropometric and biochemical measurements, resulting in unreliable assessments. NUTRITIONAL SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT Anthropometrics Anthropometric measurements have  served as  a cornerstone of nutritional assessment in older persons. A useful indicator of  nutritional risk and morbidity is a weight loss of 10 lb  in the preceding 6 months.94 This degree of weight loss is predictive of functional  limitation^^^ and health care ~harges.4~ The minimum data set used by Medicare-certified nursing homes defines weight loss as a 5% or greater loss of weight in the past month or a 10% or greater loss of   weight in the past 6 months. Ideal body weight often is used as a reference measure but has  limited value because it  requires subjective assignment of frame  size, and well-validated reference tables for older  persons are not available. Body mass index (BMI), defined as weight (kg)/height (m*), has received increasing attention as new National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines regarding body size classification have been released (Table 3).76 BMI is a practical measure of body size and indirect measure of  body fatness that does not require use of a reference table of ideal weights.  A risk threshold for a  low BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2 is  suggested.  Other anthropometric tools include skinfold and circumference measurements, but these have had limited practical application in patient care settings because of the difficulty in  training  personnel to  achieve  acceptable reliability. High-technology body composition assessments that  are impractical for routine clinical use  include water displacement, bioelectrical impedance, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, CT, nuclear h4R imaging, and total body counting of the naturally occurring potassium isotope (40K). Inadequate Nutritional Intake Inadequate nutritional intake generally has been  defined as an average or usual intake of servings of food groups, nutrients, or energy below a threshold level of the RDA. The limited  reliability of accurately assessing dietary intake measures is well documented so that  thresholds of 25% to 50% less than  the RDA usually  have been selected to  define an inadequate intake. A study observed reduced  energy intake (<5O% of calculated maintenance energy requirements) in 21% of a  sample of hospitalized older per~ons.''~ The patients with compromised energy intakes had higher  rates of in-hospital mortality and 90- day mortality  compared with  patients above the threshold for energy  intake. The minimum data  set uses a  threshold of less than 75% of food provided to prompt  a nutritional assessment in long-term care facilities. Surveys of dietary intake conducted among nursing home residents suggest that 5% to 18% of   them have  energy  intakes  below  their  recommended average energy expenditure.~~ Energy intakes among older  men and  women  in  the community setting were estimated in  a  nationwide food consumption survey.lo2 Investigators reported  that 37% to 40% of men and women studied had energy  intakes less than two thirds of the RDA, and many reported skipping at least one meal each day. Energy intakes estimated by consumption  surveys  must be interpreted with caution, however, because doubly labeled water studies suggest that older persons underreport true energy intakes by 20% to 30Y0.3~. 49, 86 Laboratory Parameters: Albumin, Prealbumin, and Cholesterol Hypoalbuminemia has been well validated as a powerful risk indicator for morbidity and mortality, but it lacks specificity and sensitivity as an indicator of nutritional  status  and may  be associated with  a host of injury, disease, or inflammatory conditions.25, 85, 95 Albumin is a negative acute-phase reactant and is subject to a cytokine-mediated decline in synthesis and to increased degradation and transcapillary  leakage. The synthesis of albumin does  not  appear to decrease with age, but longitudinal studies of serum albumin levels suggest that levels  decline  modestly with aging independent of di~ease.'~, Io4 A  serum albumin value of 38 g/L or less appears to have utility as a screening indicator among older persons.@ The prognostic value of hypoalbuminemia may be due largely  to its utility  as a  proxy measure  for underlying injury, disease, or inflammation. Adverse outcomes associated with hypoalbuminemia in the community  setting include  functional  limitation,  sarcopenia, health care use, and mortality.~, 47 In the  hospital setting, hypoalbuminemia has been associated with  an increased length of hospital stay, complications,  readmissions, and mortality.'~, 23, 33 Other possible protein markers of nutritional status are being investigated. Prealbumin (serum half-life = 2-3 d) has received the most attention because it has  a considerably shorter half-life in  serum  than  albumin  (serum half-life = 14-20 d) and may reflect short-term changes in protein status Prealbumin appears to  suffer  from many of the  same limitations as  albumin as an indicator of nutritional  status  and is confounded by a  cytokine-mediated response to injury, disease, or inflammation. Serum cholesterol has been linked to nutritional status because low cholesterol levels (460 mg/dL) often are observed in undernourished persons with serious underlying disease, such  as rnalignan~y.~~, 97 Poor  clinical  outcomes, including increased  complications, length of stay, and mortality, have been described among  hospitalized and institutionalized   older  persons with hypercholesterolemia.78~ 97 A study of community-dwelling older persons  found that subjects  in the lowest quartile of serum cholesterol levels did not differ from other subjects in their nutrient intakes.36 It  appears likely that,  similar to albumin,  acquired  hypocholesterolemia is a  nonspecific feature of poor  health status unrelated  to nutrient or  energy  intakes and reflects a  proinflammatory condition.28 Of interest is the observation that community-dwelling older persons with hypoalbuminemia and hypocholesterolemia exhibit the highest rates of adverse functional and mortality  outcomes in comparison with  persons  with hypoalbuminemia or hypercholesterolemia alone.8s It might be hypothesized that patients with multiple  indicators of inflammatory status are likely to have the most serious underlying conditions. Multi-Item Nutritional Screening Tools The  lack of a  single  assessment measure  that is  a valid indicator of a person’s comprehensive nutritional  status  has  prompted  the development of multi-item t00ls.8~ Nutritional status in the elderly can be influenced by a variety of factors, including: inactivity inadequate funds or resources mobility and transportation issues poor or restricted diets , chronic disease poverty social isolation functional limitations dementia depression poor dentition polypharmacy alcohol or substance abuse Although  older  persons in acute  or chronic care settings have been studied extensively to identify indicators and predictors of nutritional status, those in the community setting have been subject to  less investigation. More  recently, multi-item nutritional screening tools for older persons have been disseminated widely, and health professionals are beginning to use such tools for a variety of applications. In theory, the combination of multiple assessment items has  the potential  to  improve the  opportunity to  identify  high-risk subjects, but the effectiveness of this approach remains  to be clarified. It  must be determined whether these tools have appropriate specificity and sensitivity to identify undernourished persons and whether these individuals are amenable to interventions that improve their outcomes.99 The Nutrition Screening Initiative (NSI) is a collaborative effort between the American Dietetic Association, the American Academy of Family Practitioners, and the National Council on the Aging, I~C.~O A consensus approach was used by the NSI to  develop  three interdisciplinary nutrition risk-screening tools  to aid in the evaluation of   the nutritional status of   older persons. The DETERMINE checklist PO was created to raise public awareness regarding nutritional concerns of older persons. This self-report questionnaire is composed of 10 items and is intended to help identify potential risks, but not to provide a detailed assessment of diagnosis. The  Level I screenso is  a  comprehensive tool intended for use by health care professionals and  incorporates measures of height and weight  as well as  additional assessment  items regarding weight change, dietary habits, functional status, and living environment. The  Level I1 screenso encompasses all the items from Level I with additional biochemical and anthropometric measures as well  as a more detailed evaluation of depression and mental status, if   indicated. The  Level I1 screen must  be  administered by  medical and  nutrition professionals who are more highly trained than those who administer the Level I screen and is suggested for use in the diagnosis of malnutrition. The Mini-Nutritional  Assessment  (MNA)lZ9 originally was developed  to evaluate  the risk for malnutrition  among frail older  persons  and to  identify persons who may benefit from early intervention. More extensive cross-validation studies have been completed since its development. More than 600 elderly subjects have been studied to date, including those in community settings. The MNA must be administered by a trained professional and consists of 18 items, including BMI, mid arm and mid calf circumferences, weight loss, living environment, medication use, dietary habits, clinical global assessment, and self-perception of   health and nutritional status. A shortened screening version of the MNA that contains only six items has been made available and is subject to  ongoing evaluation. NUTRITION SYNDROMES Sarcopenia Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass.29, 52, 6o Biopsy studies reveal a reduction in the number and size of type I1  muscle fibers with aging,  whereas type  I fibers are The possible  relationship  between sarcopenia and functional decline is of considerable interest but  has  not been established. Sarcopenia could be an inexorable part of aging, but  sedentary lifestyle or as  yet  unrecognized  factors  may be  major contributors. Possible causes  for  sarcopenia include accelerated  muscle  loss  or  changes in  muscle accretion or  responsiveness  to  trophic hormonal or  neurologic  factors. Other suggested pathogenic factors are altered cytokine regulation, decline in endogenous growth hormone production, decreased androgen and estrogen production, and loss of a motor neurons in the spinal colu11u1.~~ Changes in dietary intake, protein metabolism, or disuse atrophy resulting from an inactive lifestyle may be  contributor^.^^, 52, 6o Experimental therapeutic approaches that have resulted in increased skeletal muscle mass include administration of trophic factors, such as growth hormone and testosterone, and resistance strength training.31, lO9, 111 The role of undemutrition  in  the  development of sarcopenia is unknown, and  the benefit, if any, of nutritional intervention awaits further investigation. Cachexia and Wasting Patients with severe  weight loss and diminished nutritional  intake have long been characterized indiscriminately as having cachexia or wasting, but more distinct  definitions  have  been suggested for  these syndromes more recently based on  the presence (cachexia) or  absence (wasting) of a  cytokine-mediated response to injury, inflammation, or  disease.96 This conceptual approach can be helpful in  understanding  the pathophysiology, even though many patients exhibit components of an inflammatory response and semistarvation. The inflammatory  cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 [IL-11, and IL-6) are believed to  play key roles in triggering the acute-phase  metabolic  response to inflammation indirectly by altering secretion of   hormones and directly by affecting target Manifestations of this response may include an elevation in resting energy expenditure, net export of amino  acids from  muscle to liver, increase in gluconeogenesis, shift toward the production of positive acute-phase proteins, and decline in the synthesis of albumin.56 These actions culminate in a catabolic state. Despite  erosion of body cell mass, weight  loss  may not be apparent because extracellular fluid is retained. Although the acute-phase metabolic response may be an  appropriate adaptive response in the setting of acute inflammation, it  can be associated with an increased rate of complications and mortality, if severe  or protracted. Diseases or  injury states characteristic of cachexia include rheumatoid arthritis, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection without serious opportunistic infection, and critical injury with adequate nutritional support. In the context of modern health care, patients with a severe inflammatory response may survive for prolonged periods. Modulation of the response to inflammation with anticytokine and anabolic agents has been the focus of research, but these interventions have met with mixed results and only  limited clinical application to date. Nutritional support interventions may serve to blunt semistarvation and associated wasting, but further studies are needed to show beneficial outcomes. Semistarvation without cytokine-mediated inflammation results in wasting of body cell mass without evidence of the acute-phase metabolic response.96 A pure wasting syndrome is characterized by reduced resting energy expenditure and preservation of visceral proteins.  Increased extracellular fluid  generally is not evident. The common feature of wasting conditions is compromised dietary intake that results in obvious  weight loss. Typical wasting  disorders include marasmus, cancer, advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with an opportunistic infection,  critical illness without  nutritional  support, and chronic organ failure syndromes (i.e., renal, hepatic, or respiratory failure). The distinction between wasting and cachexia often is blurred because many patients with these disorders also have  evidence of active inflammation. Marasmus  is the classic syndrome of semistarvation with manifest loss of subcutaneous fat and skeletal muscle.  Among patients  with cancer, AIDS, and organ  failure syndrome, weight loss associated with wasting portends a poor outcome. Interventions in patients with wasting syndromes generally have focused on nutritional supplementation and  administration of appetite-stimulating agents, but the outcome and ability to  increase body cell mass appear to be  determined largely by the underlying disease process and associated underlying inflammatory response. It is extremely difficult to accrue body cell mass in the end-stage organ failure syndromes, whereas simple semistarvation without an underlying disease may be treated readily. , Protein-Energy Undernutrition Historically, protein-energy undernutrition (PEU) has been defined by the presence of   clinical (physical signs such as weight loss) and biochemical (visceral protein)  evidence of inadequate intake. In acute and long-term health care settings, the most commonly used threshold  to  define PEU has been a  serum albumin level less than 3.5 g/dL.8 The prevalence rate for PEU among  older persons in  the  hospital has been described as greater than 33Y0,’~. 19, 74, ”* and prevalence rates for nursing homes and other  long-term care facilities may  be 33% or greater.’, lZo, lZ1 Community-dwelling older persons have a lower prevalence rate,  generally less than Io4 Prevalence studies for PEU often have been based solely on meeting a low serum albumin threshold, but many persons with PEU have an  underlying injury, disease, or  inflammatory condition. It  is likely that components of inadequate nutritional intake and cytokine-mediated inflammation  may be present. Low serum  albumin or other visceral protein measures  often are not indicative of a  compromised intake of dietary protein. That is the reason why treatment of  PEU must include identification and therapy of any  underlying disease  process  or injury  as well as  nutritional  support if appropriate. Failure to Thrive Although the term failure to thrive originally was used to  describe infants who did not achieve milestones in height,  weight,  or behavior  compared with population-based reference data,  the  term  has been adapted to  describe older persons who lose weight, exhibit a decline in physical or cognitive function (or both), and show signs of hopelessness and helplessness.” The National Institute on Aging described failure to thrive as  “a  syndrome of weight loss, decreased appetite and poor nutrition, and inactivity, often accompanied by dehydration, depressive symptoms, impaired immune function, and low Because it  has been  difficult to  characterize failure to thrive as a discrete clinical syndrome, some authorities have advocated abandoning the term as a disease construct in favor of targeting 4 potentially  treatable contributing domains: (1) impaired physical functioning, (2) undernutrition, (3) depression, and (4) cognitive impairment.lo7 In light of the limitations of the designation failure to thrive as a  systematic disease  construct, there are no prevalence  estimates  available, and nutritional or other treatments have not been tested rigorously. Obesity Excess body  weight and even modest weight  gain (25 kg) in middle age  may  be associated with  undesirable medical  comorbidities in later life including  hypertension, diabetes mellitus,  cardiovascular  disease, and osteoarthritis 5, 18, 30, 42, 50, 67 Untoward  outcomes  associated with obesity  include impaired  functional  status,=, 45, 57 increased health care resource  use? 47 and increased mortality.21, 41,116, 122 Changes in body weight (increase or decrease) may correlate even more strongly with mortality and comorbid  conditions  such  as cardiovascular disease or functional limitation.5~. 66, 75 The surging prevalence of obesity in  the United  States extends to  persons in their 60s and 70s. The prevalence of obesity (BMI 230 kg/m2) has climbed from National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I  (14.1%) to  NHANES I1  (14.5%) to NHANES I11 (22.5%)?’ Trends were similar across the spectra of age,  gender, and  race/ethnic  groups.  A  striking 33% of a  rural Pennsylvania sample of Medicare risk participants met this obesity threshold.4~ The NIH has  suggested  that: “Age  alone should  not  preclude weight loss treatment for older adults. A careful evaluation of   potential risks and benefits in the individual patient should guide management.”76 The emphasis must be on achieving a healthier weight to promote improved health, function, and quality of life. A combination of prudent  diet, behavior  modification, and activity and exercise  may  be appropriate for selected candidates. Appetite-suppressant or absorption-modulating  medications have  not been  tested adequately  among older persons to recommend their use at this time. NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIONS Oral Nutrition and Supplements Many older persons may find it difficult to maintain adequate energy and nutrient intake by eating a well-balanced diet. Health professionals who care for older persons should encourage appropriate dietary intake for as long as practicable. Consideration should be given to simple interventions that do not interfere with the overall medical treatment plan. Dental care should be implemented to correct underlying oral health concerns. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study may  be helpful for patients with  swallowing dysfunction to ascertain the  risk for aspiration and to modify the diet, as indicated. Restrictive therapeutic diets should be  liberalized, when feasible. Food intake can be promoted by catering to personal food preferences as much as possible. Consideration should be  given to  providing  foods of appropriate consistency with attention to color, texture, temperature, and arrangement. The use of herbs and  spices may help to compensate for altered senses of smell and taste that often accompany old  age. Functional limitations should be addressed, and persons needing assistance with meals should be helped. Individual food packages that are difficult to open should be avoided. Attention should be  given to the meal setting; when appropriate, patients may be placed together to increase sociability and food intake.  Adequate time should be set  aside for leisurely meals. Title I11 C of the Older Americans Act has provided for congregate and home-delivered meals for older persons, regardless of  economic status. Although this  service is available in many parts of the United States, there often is a long waiting list. When these  measures  prove  inadequate, an alternative  approach to  improved nutrient  intake for older persons who can eat is to use  dietary supplements. Historically, liquid supplements have been used, but  newer barlike supplements are preferred by many older persons when chewing is not problematic. Although food intake sometimes  is  decreased by oral supplementation  with these energy-enriched and protein-enriched formulations, there is usually an increase in overall nutritional intake because of the nutrient quality and density of the supplements. Although beyond the scope of the present article, there is growing interest in the use of nutritional  supplements in health  promotion. A  great  variety of vitamin and  mineral supplements now are marketed aggressively to older persons and are available in supermarkets and drugstores. Because approximately 50% of older persons take self-prescribed dietary and herbal supplements, it is imperative for the patient and his or her physician to obtain information about all supplements.127 The appropriateness and safety of each supplement  should be evaluated critically because consumers often are unaware of potential risks and side effects of many over-the-counter supplements. The practitioner should use the latest Dietary Reference Intakes from the Food and Nutrition Board to help evaluate patient queries.83, Another resource is the Physicians  Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines.82 Tube Feeding For persons who are unable to eat enough  to sustain  adequate nutrition by any means, tube feeding may be appropriate.  Indications for tube feeding are as follows 2"" 5l: Oncologic disease Neoplasm Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Inability to swallow Cerebrovascular accident Dysphagia Head  trauma or comatose state Advanced dementia Degenerative or debilitating disease Huntingdon's chorea Advanced Parkinson's  disease Demyelinating disease Sepsis Surgery Severe malnutrition Burns Organ failure Depression Failure to thrive Hypermetabolism or inadequate  oral intake for more than 5 days Other Tube feedings  can be provided  through  several  different access routes  to  the gastrointestinal tract. Nasoenteric tubes (8F or 10F) terminating  in  the  stomach or duodenum often are used for short-term enteral feedings. An attractive option for the  older  patient who requires  longer  term support or who is  at risk  for accidental tube displacement is a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. A percutaneous  endoscopic gastrostomy offers a  less invasive  alternative  to  a  surgical gastrostomy and does  not  require  general  anesthesia.  Jejunostomy  feedings deliver nutrients into the jejunum and may be appropriate for selected patients with  gastric dysfunction  or  obstruction. Compared with a  gastrostomy tube,  a jejunostomy tube  may  reduce  the  risk for aspiration. Tube feeding  requires integrated  care and may necessitate institutionalization for some persons. Manual dexterity, cognitive ability, and caregiver status must be evaluated  to  determine if  tube  feeding can be administered safely in alternative care sites. Selection of an enteral  feeding formula  should  take into consideration the location of the  feeding  tube,  energy and protein  requirements of the  patient, ability of the patient to digest and absorb nutrients, and expense and availability of the product in relation to its anticipated duration of  use. A standard polymeric formula (4.2 kJ/mL or 1 kcal/mL) that provides RDA levels  or  greater  for nutrients  can be used for many  patients. Pancreatic or biliary insufficiency and reduced intestinal absorptive function may warrant use of specialized elemental formulations that contain medium-chain triglycerides. Disease-specific formulas may be considered for selected patients. Concentrated formulas of 6.3 to 8.4 kJ/ mL (1.5-2 kcal/mL) may be useful for patients whose volume intake is restricted, but these also carry a greater risk  for dehydration with long-term use. Most older persons require 1400 to 2400 mL of 1.0 kcal/mL  formula during a  24-hour period to meet their estimated energy  requirements. To meet  fluid requirements, free water can be added using a bolus regimen, as indicated. Full- strength tube feeding should be started at 25 mL/h, increasing gradually in rate to the target volume to allow accommodation of  the gastrointestinal tract. Gastric residuals should be monitored intermittently, while feedings are being advanced and tolerance is established. One advantage of the gastric feeding route is that it offers the possibility of   delivering bolus feedings rapidly over 20 to 30 minutes several times  daily. This aspect is particularly attractive for long-term or home use  because an infusion pump is not required and the  patient  has greater freedom than allowed by continuous infusion. Tube feeding is well  tolerated by  many  older  persons, but there are risks associated with  its  administration. Diarrhea  frequently is  attributed to tube feedings and occurs in 5% to 30% of tube-fed older persons.11o Medications are, however, a  leading cause of diarrhea and  warrant systematic review. Bacterial contamination and  the osmolarity of the  formulation also  are  frequently cited causes of diarrhea. In some cases, consideration may be given to a trial of fiber- enriched feedings to reduce the diarrhea. Aspiration is the most serious common complication of enteral feeding and may occw  in 23% to 58% of patients receiving gastric feedings.'I7 Precautions in patients with an impaired gag reflex and associated aspiration risk include elevating the head of the bed and close monitoring of gastric  residuals. Bolus feedings are contraindicated in  these persons. For persons at long-term risk of aspiration, jejunal feeding is an option. Parenteral Nutrition Appropriate use of parenteral nutrition requires careful patient selection. Parenteral nutrition should be considered  only when  the gastrointestinal tract cannot be used for at least 5 to 7 days.  Indications include a  nonfunctional gastrointestinal tract,  obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract,  prolonged  ileus, severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage, severe malabsorption, intractable vomiting, high-output fistulas (>500 mL/day), severe  enterocolitis, severe  pancreatitis, mesenteric ischemia, and peritonitis. There has been little published information concerning use of parenteral nutrition in older persons, and much has been extrapolated from studies of young and middle-aged adults.'= The same stan- dard solutions  containing  dextrose and  amino acids are  used for parenteral nutrition in older and younger adults. Lipid emulsions are added to provide a concentrated source of energy and essential fatty acids, and electrolytes, minerals, and vitamins may be tailored to meet the patient's needs. Older persons generally  tolerate parenteral nutrition well. Older  persons are susceptible to the same complications of parenteral nutrition as are younger persons,  such  as  dextrose intolerance and complications of catheter  insertion, including catheter-related venous thrombosis and sepsis.g1 Older persons do not appear to be at greater  risk of complications than younger adults so that it  is not  appropriate to  exclude potential candidates for parenteral nutrition solely on the basis of age. Ethical factors must be considered in the selection of nutritional support interventions for an older person.  Adequate  hydration and nutrition  always must be provided to an older patient, unless (1) a fully competent subject refuses nutritional support after having been apprised adequately of  the potential consequences and records this in written form, with witnesses, or (2) a terminally ill subject has executed  a  legally binding living  will  or  medical  directive that precludes  nutritional support in the event of terminal illness or impending death. Nutritional support may be withheld or withdrawn in concordance with advanced care directives after careful review of comorbidities and futility. SUMMARY Nutrition is a prime concern for the optimal health of older persons. Nutritional requirements for older persons must take into account the physiologic changes that occur with aging. The gastrointestinal  tract is the site of key structural and functional changes that affect nutrient intake and assimilation. A working knowledge of nutritional screening, assessment, and interventions can assist the practitioner in providing quality care for the older patient. ",-,"1.

There has been much interest in dietary strategies to improve immunity in older people, but there is an assumption that modulation of the immune response in older people will be based on the same principles as for young adults. Recent evidence suggests that ageing fundamentally alters the impact of nutrition on immune function. As a result, interpretation of data from studies investigating the impact of diet on immune function is highly dependent on subject age. Study design is critically important when investigating the efficacy of dietary components, and most studies involving older people include rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria based on medical history, laboratory tests, general health status and often nutritional status. However, immunological status is rarely accounted for, but can vary significantly, even amongst healthy older people. There Are several clear examples of age-related changes in immune cell composition, phenotype and/or function, which can directly alter the outcome of an intervention. This review usestwo case studies to illustrate how the effects ofn-3 PUFA and probiotics differ markedly in young v. older subjects. Evidence from both suggests that baseline differences in immuno-senescence influence the outcome of an intervention, highlighting the need for detailed immunological characterisation of subjects prior to interventions. Finally, future work elucidating alterations in metabolic regulation within cells of the immune system as a result of ageing may be important in understanding the impact of diet on immune function in older people. Ageing: Fatty acid: Immunity: Nutrition: Probiotic","Nutritional status has a profound influence on resistance to infection, which is exemplified by the vicious cycle between undernutrition and infection in developing countries(1).  However,  vulnerable  groups  in  developed countries are also at risk of age- or disease-related malnutrition, which can impact on the immune response to infection  and  to  vaccination.  Thus,  while  decreased immune function due to malnutrition primarily affects children  in  developing  countries,  in  the  developed world, it is mainly a problem for older people(2).By 2050, approximately 25 % of the population will be older than 65 years(3)and the impact of this on public health is a major global challenge. However, decreased immune function as a result of malnutrition should not be confused with immunosenescence; an obvious difference is that malnutrition and, to some extent its consequences, are treatable. Immunosenescence is irreversible and describes the biological ageing of the immune system, which is associated with a progressive decline in both innate and adaptive immunity, poor response to vaccination and increased prevalence of cancer, infections and autoimmune and chronic diseases. While nutritional interventions may delay this process, the evidence for this remains controversial, particularly in terms of the nature and potency of immunomodulatory activity and of translation into a corresponding change in clinical outcome(4,5). Furthermore, there is a fundamental lack of understanding as to how immunosenescence alters the response of cells of the immune system to dietary components. Most studies examining the effects of diet on immune function fail to adequately characterise target populations in terms of nutritional status, health status,genetic background and few, if any, characterise them in terms of the immunological status. This review focuses on two case studies, which demonstrate that failure to account for immunosenescence can significantly influence the outcome of a nutritional intervention. It also explores proposed mechanisms by which ageing alters metabolic regulation of immune cells and whether metabolic pathways could be targeted for immunoregulation.Case study: ageing alters the immune response ton-3PUFAFatty acids play diverse roles in all cells, serving as an important source of energy, as structural components of cell membranes, signalling molecules, bioactive mediators and regulators of gene expression. Human immune cell phospholipids contain about 1 % EPA and 2·5 % DHAin addition to 20 % arachidonic acid(6,7). As the long-chainn-3 PUFA content of the diet increases, lymphocyte arachidonic acid decreases in a curvilinear fashion.In human studies, dietaryn-3 PUFA never exceeds 3 %of total energy, whereas in animal studies, intake is often considerably higher, and this is thought to explain the discrepancies that exist between animal and human studies investigating the immunomodulatory effects of n-3 PUFA(7). As a result, it remains unclear to what extent and at what dosen-3 PUFA have immunomodulatory  effects  in  human  subjects.  Nevertheless,  the literature suggests that fish oil has a greater impact on immune  function  in  elderly  compared  with  young subjects(8–10)and that this may be related to the fact that older subjects appear to incorporate EPA into plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells more readily than younger subjects(11)(Fig. 1). EPA resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in neutrophil respiratory burst in older, but not younger subjects(11). However,prostaglandin E2 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was decreased in both groups and phagocytosis and cytokine production were not affected in either group(11). This highlights the fact that age is likely to be an important factor when considering the impact of n-3 PUFA on immunity, not only because of the influence of immunosenescence, but also because immune cells from older subjects appear to be more responsive to the availability ofn-3 PUFA. Recent work suggests that the cholesterol content of T lymphocytes from healthy elderly subjects is higher than that of young subjects,  and  that  membrane fluidity  is  subsequently decreased(12).  Furthermore,  the  coalescence  of  lipid rafts at the site of T cell receptor engagement is impaired in elderly subjects(12,13). The impact of ageing on lipid raft composition and function appears to be most evident in the CD4+T cell population and affects cytokine signalling(13,14). Thus, the greater responsiveness of T cell membranes ton-3 PUFA in older subjects could result in alteration of lipid raft structure, and subsequently of cell function, effects which are absent in youngersubjects.Case study: ageing alters the immune response to probiotics Influenza isa major cause of death in older people and while vaccination offers a prophylactic solution for preventing infection and associated complications, immunosenescence significantly impairs vaccine efficacy(15). Potential adju-vantsanddietarystrategiestoimprovetheimmuneresponseto influenzavaccines are therefore of interest, particularly in older people. Emerging evidence suggests that the resident gut microbiota plays an influential role in shaping antiviral defenses and modulating the outcome of viral infections through  inflammasome-mediated  cytokine  release(16).Antibiotic-treated mice have reduced levels of IL-1 secretion in the lung during influenza infection, supporting the suggestion that gut-resident bacteria are involved in regulating cytokine production(16).Ithasbeenspeculatedthatgutmicrobesreleaselowlevelsofpatternrecognitionre-ceptor ligands, which provide signals for inflammasome-mediated cytokine release (for example, in the lung during influenza infection). These in turn regulate the activity of respiratory dendritic cells during activation of adaptive immunity against the virus(16), and together, this forms the basis for the hypothesis that pre- and probiotics may modulate responses to infection or vaccination.Trials investigating the use of probiotics in prevention of common respiratory illnesses have produced mixed results(17), although a recent systematic review concluded that they significantly reduce episodes of acute upper respiratory tract infection and antibiotic usage in infants and young to middle-aged adults(18). Response to vaccination is increasingly being used as a surrogate for the response to infection(19).The Majority Of Studies investigating the impact of probiotics on responses to vaccination have been conducted in healthy adults, andsomeshowbor-derline effects of probiotics on serum or salivary IgA titres,although the clinical relevance is not clear(20). Studies in infants and in elderly subjects, particularly those examining the response to influenza vaccination, are very limited,as are studies on the effects of prebiotics on immune func-tion(21)and vaccination(20). Since ageing is associated with reduced biodiversity and compromised stability of the gut microbiota(22), as well as immunosenescence, older individuals may derive particular benefit from intervention with pre- and/or probiotics.Previous studies investigating the effects of probiotics on the response to vaccination have mainly focused on antibody production. While some studies have reported a modest effect of probiotics on the antibody response to vaccination in adults, trials in older subjects are largely inconsistent and data are limited(20). In a recent study(the PRIMAGE (Probiotics, Immunity and Ageing)trial), we demonstrated that while there was marked impairment of the antibody response to influenza vaccination in older subjects, intervention with a novel synbio-tic,Bifidobacterium longum bv. infantis CCUG 52486 combined  with  gluco-oligosaccharide  (B.  longum+Gl-OS) failed to reverse this impairment(23). Although there is general consensus that ageing impairs the response to influenza vaccination(24), there are very few robust studies specifically comparing responses of young and older subjects, and there are no other studies directly comparing the efficacy of pre- and probiotics on the immune response of young and older subjects to vaccination. In the PRIMAGE trial, the response of the young and older subjects to the intervention differed to some degree. In older subjects consuming the synbiotic,there was a trend for reduced seroconversion to the Brisbane subunit of the vaccine, whereas in the young subjects, there were trends for enhanced production of vaccine-specific  IgM  and,  to  some  extent,  IgG(23).Increased production of vaccine-specific IgM and IgG following intervention with probiotics has been reported in several other studies(25–29). The possibility that there is a differential immune response to probiotics in young y. older subjects has also been demonstrated inin vitro studies. You and Yaqoob(30)demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from older subjects (60–85 years) were more responsive to the immunoregulatory effects (IL-10 induction) of two strains of bifidobacteria than young subjects (18–30 years), whereas peripheral blood mononuclear cells from young subjects were more  responsive  to  the  immunostimulatory  effects(IL-12 induction) of two strains of lactobacilli. Further Studies demonstrated that probiotics increased the responsiveness of dendritic cells in older subjects to a greater degree than young subjects, but this was not sufficient to overcome the impact of immunosenescence in a mixed leukocyte reaction(31). The choice of probiotic,particularly for older individuals, is a matter of debate and it has been suggested that‘successfully aged’donors of probiotic strains might survive better in an older host and achieve a more suitable equilibrium with the resident microbiota(32).B. longum bv. infantis CCUG 52486 is an example of a strain present in particularly healthy subjects aged >90 years(33). It has subsequently been demonstrated  to  have  particular  ecological fitness  and anti-pathogenic effects in vitro(34)and, as described earlier,  immunomodulatory  effects,  which  are  strongly influenced by the age of the host(30,31).Further  immunological  characterisation  in  thePRIMAGE trial revealed that B and T cell profiles differed markedly between young and older subjects, and that vaccination increased numbers of specific memory subsets in young subjects, but failed to do so in older subjects (S Enani, A Przemska-Kosicka, CE Childset al.,unpublished results). A key finding was the observation that there was a greater degree of immunosenescence at baseline in older subjects randomised to the synbiotic,which occurred entirely by chance, but could explain the particularly poor response of these subjects to the vaccination(23). T cells are particularly susceptible to senescence, resulting in loss of CD28; repeated antigenic exposure, for example to cytomegalovirus, is suggested to play a major role in this(35,36). Latent infection with cytomegalovirus has been demonstrated to result in a poor response to infection and vaccination(36). In thePRIMAGE trial, not only did older subjects randomized to the synbiotic have a significantly higher number of senescent (CD28−CD57+) helper T cells at baseline compared with those randomised to the placebo, they also had significantly higher plasma levels of anti-cytomegalovirus IgG and a greater tendency for cytomegalovirus seropositivity. Moreover, higher numbers of CD28−CD57+helperT cells were associated with failure to seroconvert to the Brisbane subunit of the vaccine, strongly suggesting that the subjects randomised to the synbiotic were already at a significant disadvantage in terms of likely ability to respond to the vaccine compared with those randomised to the placebo and that differences in immunosenescence between the randomised groups at baseline may have influenced the outcome of the intervention (Fig. 2). Future work therefore needs to consider prospective randomisation of subjects based on robust immunological markers; this is challenging given the wide range of potential markers and uncertainty regarding their predictive value. Ageing alters metabolic regulation of T cells Over the past few decades, our understanding of T cell activation has extended to exploration of integration between canonical T cell signalling pathways and metabolic signalling programmes(37), and it has been proposed that immunosenescence is linked to alterations or defects in that integration(38). Although several transcription factors and serine/threonine kinases are central to the integration of immunological and metabolic pathways(37),the energy sensor, AMPK, is of particular interest in the context of ageing. AMPK is a central regulator of metabolic stress and is activated by an increase in the AMP:ATP ratio, as well as by T cell receptor engagement. In fact, it has been suggested that AMPK activation in response to antigen anticipates ATP depletion even  in  the  presence  of  adequate  nutrients(23).In AMPK-deficient T cells, metabolic stress due to glucose deprivation induces enhanced cell death. Senescent T Cells demonstrate spontaneous phosphorylation- and therefore activation- of AMP(38). However, contrary to expectation, senescent cells did not contains low levels of ATP(8,38). Instead, it is suggested that AMPK activation triggered by glucose deprivation results in activation of the p38 pathway, which leads to DNA damage and immunosenescence(38).  Conversely,  AMPK  silencing restores proliferation(37). This is a previously unrecognised mode of activation for p38 in T cells and the first demonstration of a pathway which integrates low nutrient sensing with DNA damage and senescence. The observation that nutrient deprivation triggers pathways linked with immunosenescence seems to contradict the widely held belief that energy restriction enhances lifespan,but data on energy restriction and infections is not clear cut and this remains an important area for future work.Transcription factors and signalling proteins involved in regulatory and metabolic pathways represent novel targets for immune modulation. Indeed, it has been suggested that targeting AMPK and mechanistic target of rapamycin may be a strategy for suppressing immune responses  and  treating  inflammatory  diseases(37).However, the suggestion that this may allow more selective regulation of immune responses than ubiquitous signalling pathways should be interpreted with caution as there is no clear reason to believe that this is the case.Conclusion Ageing alters the immune response to dietary interventions; specific examples described in this review demonstrate that young and older subjects respond differently to interventions involving dietary fatty acids and probiotics. It is critical that baseline differences in immunosenescence in dietary studies involving older subjects are accounted for as they can directly influence the outcome of the intervention. Ageing also alters metabolic regulation of T cells; elucidation of alterations in metabolic regulation in ageing T cells may prove to be important in understanding the impact of diet on immune function in older people.Acknowledgement The author acknowledges Agnieszka Przemska-Kosicka,Caroline  Childs,  Sumia  Enani,  Catherine  Maidens, Honglin Dong, Jialou You and Iman Bin Dayel, who contributed to some of the work described in this review.

Patient-Related and Financial Outcomes Analysis of Conventional Full-Arch Rehabilitation Versus the All-on-4 Concept: A Cohort Study,"Charles A. Babbush, DDS, MScD, Ali Kanawati, DDS, MBA, MS, Georgios A. Kotsakis, DDS, and James E. Hinrichs, DDS, MS","Background: Patient-related variables such as cost of treatment,length of the treatment period, and comfort  provided  by  the  interim prosthesis when treatment planning for full-arch rehabilitation are often neglected in dental publications. Methods:Two patient cohorts were followed up longitudinally in this study: the“All-on-4 treatment concept group”and the“historical group.”The number of implants,total treatment time, number of surgical procedures, number of sinus grafts, necessity for immediate provisional  implants,  adjusted  cost associated for treatment in each group, and the quality of interim prosthesis were compared. Results:The total adjusted cost for patients receiving All-on-4 treatment concept averaged at $42,42263860 (€31,39262856), whereas the mean total adjusted cost for the historical group was $57,944620,198(€42,87962113) (P¼0.01). The difference in cost had a mean valueof $7307 (€5407) per jaw. Factors associated with complexity of treatment and patient comfort, such as the quality of interim prosthesis,number of surgeries, and duration of treatment time, all significantly favored the All-on-4 treatment concept group in comparison with conventional treatment modalities. Conclusions: When  implant rehabilitation of the total jaw is sought, the All-on-4 treatment concept should be considered the least costly  and  least  time  consuming treatment  option.  (Implant  Dent 2014;23:218–224) Keywords:finances,  patient related, all-on-4 treatment concept,dental implants","The use of osseointegrated dental implants in clinical practice began more than 5 decades ago with the novel work of Brånemark.1 The initial aim at that time was to provide an aggressive solution for improving the quality  of  life  of  fully  edentulous patients. Dental implants have become the premier choice among other treatment alternatives for replacement of missing teeth in contemporary clinical practice. Even though various treatment approaches are available for the restoration of partially edentulous patients,the restoration of fully edentulous jaws has  been  revolutionized,  thanks  to the introduction of implant-supported restorations.2 The high success and survival rate of implants has given a significance impetus to their mainstream use in clinical practice. Selection among the various approaches available for the rehabilitation of complete edentulism has been further challenged under the light of recent advances such as the All-on-4  (All-on-4;  Nobel  Biocare,Göteborg, Sweden) treatment concept.3 The All-on-4 treatment concept has initiated a transition from a mechanical approach  for  implant  dentistry  toa new era where treatment planning is based on biomechanics and function,esthetics, and overall quality of life. Maló et al3,4 used bioengineering principles to pioneer the All-on-4 treatment concept and suggested that the placement of 4 implants in strategic positions in an edentulous jaw can provide adequate support for the immediate loading of a fixed restoration. Use of this innovative treatment  planning  approach  permits immediate loading with a fixed provisional restoration. At 3 to 4 months, fabrication of a fixed definitive prosthesis is initiated.5,Initially, there was significant skepticism regarding this approach based on knowledge from in silico analysis that angled abutments or /implants are associated with higher stress in the bone.7 However,  more  elaborate  protocol-specific models were developed that verified the feasibility of placing 2 straight and 2 tilted implants and found the support for the fixed prosthesis to be equal or superior to conventional concepts.8–10 Subsequently, the engineering principle that dictated the use of as many straight implants as possible in a jaw begun to decrease with the introduction of new evidence.Over the last decade, there has also been an increase in the volume of scientific evidence documenting the clinical performance of the All-on-4 treatment concept, which has enhanced its’widespread clinical use. Following the report of longitudinal data by Maloet al,11 several other authors have verified the high success rates associated with the use of this protocol, such as Galindo and Butura12In their study,857 implants were placed as 2 pairsper jaw according to the All-on-4 treatment concept. After 3 years of follow-up,only 3 implants failed.12 Babbush et al 5 reported a 99.6%cumulative survival rate with follow-up of up to 29-months for 708 implants placed in complex cases including immediate implant placement and immediate loading using the same concept.In even wider studies, Babbushand Brokloff 13 and Graves et al 14 have reported results from 1001 and 1110 implants, respectively, which were placed with the same protocol. Their outcomes further supported the success rates reported in the previous studies. The clinical success of the All-on-4 treatment concept is well documented in the literature, and it is considered to be a predictable technique with a very good prognosis.15 Additional studies that have demonstrated the impact of the All-on-4 treatment concept on the quality of life of these patients have concluded that majority of them is highly satisfied with this type of treatment, even more so thanks to the immediate-fixed provisional prosthesis.16,17 Despite the previously cited benefits of the All-on-4 treatment concept,implant treatment planning is still largely approached on an empirical basis in accordance with the familiarity of the surgeon and the restorative dentist with specific technique. Patient-related variables such as cost of treatment,the length of treatment, and comfort provided by the interim prosthesis during the transition from the surgical insertion phase until delivery of the final prosthesis are often neglected in clinical research. The application of results of studies on the clinical performance of the All-on-4 treatment concept has been hindered by the lack of evaluation of factors other than purely clinically related variables,such as implant success or prosthesis survival. The missing part of the equation may be the answer to the question whether the All-on-4 treatment concept provides a substantial financial benefits when compared with conventional full-mouth implant rehabilitation strategies.The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate patient-related financial outcomes of treatment between a cohort of patients treated with traditional approaches for the rehabilitation of the complete jaw versus a cohort of patients treated with the All-on-4 treatment concept. Secondary outcomes such as the number of surgeries, the duration of treatment, and the quality of the interim restoration (removable vs fixed) were also evaluated to assess the  complexity  of  each  treatment approach from a patient’s perspective.Results of this study may encourage clinicians to include a patient-related perspective in their decision-making philosophy when planning treatment for the implant rehabilitation of the total jaw. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two patient cohorts were randomly selected following chart review of the records of a single private practice and were followed up longitudinally in this study: the All-on-4 treatment concept and the“historical (HIS) group.”All patients were surgically treated in the same private practice by one of the authors(C.A.B.), a board-certified, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, with extensive experience in implant reconstruction since 1968. All patients consented to the proposed treatment plan at the time of treatment.The HIS group consisted of patients who  underwent  treatment  between January 1991 and October 2008 using conventional implant treatment-planning approaches.2 Treatment alternatives included full-arch fixed restorations on natural  dentition,  implant-supported overdentures, or fixed full-arch implant-supported restorations on at least 6 implants perjaw(HISgroup)(Figs.1 and 2).Patients in the“All-on-4 treatment concept”(AOF) group underwent treatment using the All-on-4 treatment concept 3  from September 2008 to October 2010 (Figs. 3 and 4).Inclusion criteria:•Patients requiring complete rehabilitation of the maxilla and the mandible.•Completed treatment with full-arch fixed restorations on natural dentition, implant-supported overdentures,fixed implant-supported restorations on at least 6 implants per jaw (HIS group), or fixed screw retained restorations on 4 implants per jaw (AOF).Exclusion criteria: inadequate financial data, patients who had received discounts, patients electing to tolerate removable partial dentures, and patients with unrestored natural teeth.Demographic data, the number of extractions, the number of implants placed, necessity for sinus augmentation, type of final prosthesis, and follow-up time were recorded for patients in each cohort. The number of surgical interventions and the type of interim restoration were also evaluated as factors associated with the patients’well-being.Fewer surgical interventions were considered as providing increased patient satisfaction in comparison with a greater number of surgical interventions.The types of interim restorations employed were fixed screw-retained,fixed cemented-retained,fixed teeth-supported,full denture,or non provisional prosthesis. Interim restoration alternatives were categorized according to their impact on quality of life as reported by Babbush 16 and Brennan et al.18 Two“quality gradients”for interim prosthesis were assigned according to the following assumption:fixed provisional restorations either on teeth, or implants were considered as satisfactory (grade A), whereas interim full dentures or no provisional restorations were considered as compromised alternatives (grade B).Patients were followed up for at least 2 years postloading for evaluation of implant success according to the criteria of Buser et al 19 Briefly, the absence of subjective symptoms, active peri implant disease, and mobility were assessed clinically when radiographic examination  was  performed  during routine follow-ups to verify the absence of pathology and/or bone loss around the implant.Financial Analysis Both patient cohorts were followed up until placement of definitive restorations for estimation of treatment expenses. Direct costs for each intervention were retrieved from patients’financial records and were adjusted using the 2013 version of a specialized software(CPI Inflation calculator; Bureau of Labor statistics, US department of Labor), which reflects the current value of money of a specific amount of finances spent during a previous year, based on the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  All  treatment  costs  were adjusted to June 2013 prices before statistical analysis. The analysis was performed from a patient’s perspective.The surgical fee and prosthetic fee were combined to calculate total expenses per patient incurred during treatment of each jaw. The cost per arch ratio (CPAr) was estimated for each patient cohort after adding the implant and prosthesis cumulative costs for each patient in the cohort,dividing it by the number of patients and further dividing by 2. The CPAr was used as a direct measure of value for money for each cohort. Based on 2013 currency exchange average, an exchange rate of 0.74 was used to estimate the US dollar to Euro conversions.Statistical Analysis Demographic data and data associated with type of treatment and finances were reported descriptively using mean or median as a measure of central tendency and SD or range as a measure of variance when indicated. An unpaired t test, or a Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the number of implants,total treatment time, the number of surgical procedures, the number of sinus grafts, necessity for immediate provisional implants, and adjusted cost associated for treatment in each group depending on results of a Shapiro-Wilk normality test for each variable. Dataon the quality of interim prosthesis were treated as ordinal data, anda Mann-Whitney ranked test was used for assessing the difference on the quality  of  the  interim  prostheses between the 2 groups.An application specific software was used for statistical analysis, andthe threshold for significance was set atP,0.05.20 RESULTS Both cohorts had similar baseline characteristics with the historical consisting of 15 patients (6 men and 9 women; mean age at baseline, 55 years;range, 15–81 years) and the All-on-4 treatment concept consisting of the same number of patients (9 men and 6 women), with a mean age of 62 years at baseline (range, 46–82 years). Age and gender were not significantly different at baseline between the 2 groups (P¼0.065 andP¼0.29, respectively).Patients in the AOF group required an average of 6.8764.41 extractions in the maxilla and 8.7363.71 in the mandible, whereas patients in the“traditional”group required 6.9364.46 in the maxilla and 5.4065.51 in the mandible. No significant difference was identified between the 2 groups. Treatment characteristics for patients of both groups are presented in Table 1. All patients in the AOF group were treated using NobelActive (NobelBiocare) implants. More heterogeneity was observed in the HIS group with IMZ (Friedrichsfeld AG, Mannheim,Germany), Nobel Replace (Nobel Biocare), Replace Select (Nobel Biocare),Steri-oss (Steri-Oss, Yorba Linda, CA),Camlog (CAMLOG Biotechnologies AG, Basel, Switzerland), and NobelActive (Nobel Biocare) implants being used. Patients in the AOF group had significantly less implants placed and needed no adjunctive sinus augmentation procedures or immediate provisional implants to support interim prosthesis.Restorations in both groups of patients remained functional throughout the observation period for a 100%prosthesis survival rate in each group.In the AOF group, 1 NobelActive implant failed before delivery of the final prosthesis and was replaced and incorporated into the prosthesis with no further complications or failure. The Implant cumulative survival rate at the end of the follow-up was 99.17%(119/120). In the HIS group, 2 patients experienced implant failure. In 1 patient who had 10 implants placed in the maxilla, 1 was not osseointegrated at the second-stage surgery. The remaining 9 implants were deemed adequate to support a fixed restoration, and the implant was not replaced. In another patient, 2 implants fractured after the patient reported being involved in a“fist-fight.”They were each replaced at stage 2 surgery and were loaded with no further complications.Differences between groups were identified in the mean follow-up time that was 41.32610.19 months in the AOF group and 139.40661.57 in the HIS group. This difference is attributed to the transition of this clinic setting toward the use of the All-on-4 treatment concept in recent years.Patient-Related Financial Outcomes The use of a specialized inflation calculator software allowed to estimate the mean total cost for each treatment modality based on June 2013 values.The total cost for patients receiving theAll-on-4 treatment concept averaged at$42,42263860 (€31,39262856),whereas the mean total cost for the HIS group was $57,944620,198(€42,87962113). The maximum in each group was $47,987 (€35,510)and $89,961 (€66,571), respectively. Statistical analysis revealed that treatment in the HIS group was significantly more expensive (P¼0.01).The median CPAr in the AOF group was $21,328 (€15,783) for rehabilitation of 1 arch, whereas the HISgroup  had  a  median  of  $28,635(€21,190), for a difference of $7307(€5407) per jaw that yielded the AOF concept group statistically significant less costly (P¼0.01). Comparison of CPAr between groups revealed that the majority of CPAr values in the AOF group were within the lowest quarter percentile of the HIS group (Fig. 5).Patient-Related“Well-Being”Outcomes During the post implant placement healing period, all patients in the AOF group were restored with“A”quality provisional restorations in both jaws.In the HIS group,“B”quality restorations were delivered in the maxilla of 10 of 15 patients (66.6%), all of which were immediate complete dentures. In the mandible, 3 patients were provisionally restored with immediate complete dentures, and 1 patient elected to proceed with no provisional denture;the remaining patients (11/15) received fixed interim restorations (Fig. 6).In the HIS group, an average of 2.760.8 surgeries were required for the total rehabilitation of both jaws, whereas a single surgical intervention was performed in all cases in the All-on-4 treatment  concept.  Statistical  analysis revealed that a significantly lower number of surgeries is required for patients undergoing treatment with the All-on-4 treatment concept protocol (P,0.001). DISCUSSION In this study, we longitudinally followed up 2 cohorts of patients. The Most relevant finding was that the cost of treatment per jaw was significantly less in the AOF group in comparison with the HIS group. The difference was approximately $7300 (€5400), which can be translated to $14,600 (€10,800)for patients that require maxillary and mandibular prostheses.It has been well documented that the All-on-4 treatment concept in full-arch reconstruction is a viable long-term treatment modality.11,21–23 Most current results from a large patient pool have shown that the pros-theses’survival rate for the All-on-4 treatment concept cases is 99.2% with up to 10 years of follow-up, whereas the implant success rate is as high as 94.8%.11 Undoubtedly, clinical success andfinancesare 2 pivotal factors in patients’decision-making process to accept or reject a proposed treatment plan.24–28 Our study also included outcomes from the assessment of quality of life during treatment. The quality of interim prosthesis in each patient was selected as an appropriate surrogate for the patient's quality of comfort during the transitional phase from the time of extraction until the delivery of the definitive prosthesis.  It  is  well  documented  that removable dentures yield significantly less patient satisfaction in comparison with fixed restorations and are associated with unsatisfactory masticatory ability and have a negative effect on the person's’social life.29–31 Comparison of the AOF and the HIS cohort showed that the quality of interim prosthesis was statistically significant better in the AOF group.Forty-seven percent of subjects in the HIS group could not have a fixed interim prosthesis based on conventional treatment planning.Babbush16was thefirst to discussthe patient related-aspects of treatment using the All-on-4 treatment concept.The results showed that 95% patients were satisfied with their experience after  treatment,  with  74%  patients describing themselves as extremely satisfied. These findings point out that the economics for the patient is not the only benefit associated with the All-on-4 treatment concept approach.The All-on-4 treatment concept is based on fundamentally patient-oriented rationale for the rehabilitation of total jaws. It is a result of the optimization of 4 factors: function, biomechanics,affordability, and patient comfort.The 2 latter factors had not been compared with traditional implant treatment planning until now. The difference in the mean cost per jaw that we identified was approximately 25.5%relative to the mean cost per arch forthe HIS cohort. This is a significant financial benefit for a patient that is already called to allocate a large amount of funds. In addition, the results showed a difference in the number of surgical interventions as 2.7-fold and total treatment time as 2.1-fold, in the HIS group in comparison with the AOF.The Findings of this study aim to provide  clinicians  with  a  broader perspective  for  treatment  planning for full-arch rehabilitation. When treatment alternatives are discussed with patients, it is important to address such factors as duration of treatment, patient quality of life during treatment, andfinances, in addition to clinical success including survival of the prosthesis and individual implants. The All-on-4 treatment concept was found to be significantly   better   than   conventional treatment in regard to all the financial and patient-related outcomes investigated in this study. CONCLUSION The financial  analysis revealed a highly significant decrease in cost for the All-on-4 treatment concept compared with the corresponding cost of using a conventional implant treatment planning approach. The difference in cost had a mean value of $7307 (€5407)per jaw. It can be concluded that, when implant rehabilitation of an edentulous arch is sought, the All-on-4 treatment concept should be considered the least costly treatment option.Factors associated with complexity of treatment and patient comfort, such as the quality of interim prosthesis, the number of surgeries, and duration of treatment time all significantly favor the All-on-4 treatment concept in comparison with conventional treatment modalities.

OLD AGE ALONE MAY NOT BE A RISK FACTOR FOR DENTAL IMPLANT FAILURE,"Srinivasan M, Meyer S, Mombelli A, Müller F.","SUMMARY Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, prospective case–control studies, and prospective case series were selected without date or language restrictions. Inclusion criteria included those studies evaluating implant success rate in completely or partially edentulous patients age 65 years or older requiring dental implant for fixed or removal prosthesis. A search was conducted of 4 electronic databases in addition to a manual search.Key study factor Implant system, loading protocol, partial or complete edentulousness, and typeof prosthetic rehabilitation (fixed or removable prosthesis).Main outcome measure The primary outcome was implant survival rate. Marginal bone loss and rates of technical, mechanical, or biological complications were secondary outcomes.Main results The search process resulted in 11 studies (2 RCTs, 1 prospective cohort, 1 case–control, 1 prospective comparative, and 6 prospective case series). A meta-analysis was performed on the post-loading implant survival rates at various time points (1, 3, 5, and 10 years). The random effects model revealed an overall 1-year post-loading implant survival of 97.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 95.8-98.8; I 250.00%,p5.968;n511 studies). Six studies provided data for a 3-year analysis, and the model revealed an overall post-loading implant survival rate of 96.3% (95% CI: 92.8-98.1). Five-year post-loading implant survival rate was 96.2%(95% CI: 93.0-97.9), whereas 10-year survival rate was 91.2% (95% CI: 83.4-95.6,n53 studies). The reported 1-year average marginal bone loss (peri-implant marginal bone level changes [PI-MBL]) ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 mm, and the re-ported 5- and 10-year PI-MBLs were 0.7 and 1.5 mm, respectively. Information Pertaining to the technical and biological complications in the included studies was inadequate for statistical analysis. Conclusions The authors concluded that dental implant therapy in elderly edentulous patients is a predictable, long-term treatment option that offers high implant survival rates, clinically acceptable MBL changes, and minimal complications. Therefore, age alone need not be considered a factor in choosing dental implant therapy.","COMMENTARY AND ANALYSIS The elderly population ($65 years) has obviously increased throughout the world. This increase is due to many factors,including increased life expectancy, reduction in mortality,slow growth, and urbanization.1,2 The introduction of dental implants, without a doubt, improves to a large extent patients’oral rehabilitation because of its apparent predict-ability.3 The candidates for dental implant treatment are not restricted to the younger population. Recently dental implants that support removable or fixed prosthesis for elderly  patients  have  been  considered  a  primary rehabilitative option.4,5 Most previous studies revealed a comparable survival rate for dental implants in younger and older populations.However, some studies suggest the bone and soft tissue healing around implants is poor in older patients, partly due to their higher prevalence of systemic disease and the metabolic  changes  accompanying  aging.2,6-8In  fact,currently there is no clear evidence to accept or refute the argument that old age is a risk factor for dental implant failure.Strengths of this systematic review This systematic review was reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines.9A well-structured PICO question and clearly listed inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in this review. Two authors conducted a thorough literature search independently. Moreover, the disagreements were resolved through discussions and they contacted authors for missing data.Weakness of this systematic review One of the greatest limitations in this review is that it includes different study types: RCTs, prospective cohort studies, case–control studies, and even case series. This Mixture of studies led to weak evidence, especially from case–control studies and case series because of the many limitations in these study forms. These include selection biases and associated confounding factors.10 Another Important weakness in this review is the absence of assessment of the quality of included studies even for 2 RCTs because the RCTs, cohort studies, and case control studies could only be considered as prospective case series as stated by the authors of this review.This review was unable to identify RCTs with objectives similar to those in the framed population intervention/exposure comparison outcome (PICO) question because there were none. Hence, the conclusions drawn from the results of this meta-analysis, although credible, should be interpreted cautiously. The author reported in the conclusion part of this review that there is robust evidence for implant placement in older people but really this conclusion is not true because we cannot draw this level of evidence from this review with its included studies as previously mentioned.Conclusions and implications for dental practice The elderly are among the most important candidates for oral rehabilitation using dental implants. Based on the present review, the dental implant survival rate is high, MBL changes are clinically acceptable, and there are minimal complications in older people, all of which mean that old age alone is not a risk factor. Although dental implants are a highly successful treatment modality in this population, other confounding factors that may be associated with increased age (eg, systemic diseases) must be carefully assessed before any dental implant treatment planning. Rather than aging itself, the specific nature of the disease process, such as osteoporosis or diabetes, and local bone quality and quantity at the implant site, mostly related to aging, are important for successful dental implant treatment.The evidence from this review is weak due to the type of available included studies. Consequently, it is highly recommended that further well-designed studies be conducted with the following requirements: RCTs, large sample size, andlonger follow-up periods to produce more robust evidence.",-,"1.

"Trends in Dental Implant Use in the U.S., 1999-2016, and Projections to 2026","H.W. Elani, J.R. Starr, J.D. Da Silva, and G.O. Gallucci","Dental  implants  have  become  an  increasingly  popular  treatment  choice  for  replacing  missing  teeth.  Yet,  little  is  known  about  the  prevalence and sociodemographic distribution of dental implant use in the United States. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed data from 7 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999 to 2016. We estimated dental implant prevalence among adults missing any teeth for each survey period overall as stratified by sociodemographic characteristics. We calculated absolute and relative  differences  from  1999–2000  to  2015–2016  and  fit  logistic  regression  models  to  estimate  changes  over  time.  We  also  used  multivariable logistic regression to estimate independent associations of sociodemographic covariates with the presence of any implant. We projected the proportion of patients treated with dental implants into the year 2026 under varying assumptions of how the temporal trend would continue. There has been a large increase in the prevalence of dental implants, from 0.7% in 1999 to 2000 to 5.7% in 2015 to 2016. The largest absolute increase in prevalence (12.9%) was among individuals 65 to 74 y old, whereas the largest relative increase was ~1,000% among those 55 to 64 y old. There was an average covariate-adjusted increase in dental implant prevalence of 14% per year (95% CI, 11% to 18%). Having private insurance (vs. none or public insurance) or more than a high school education (vs. high school or less) was each associated with a 2-fold increase in prevalence, with an almost 13-fold (95% CI, 8 to 21) increase for older adults. Dental implant prevalence projected to 2026 ranged from 5.7% in the most conservative scenario to 23% in the least. This study demonstrates that dental implant prevalence among US adults with missing teeth has substantially increased since 1999. Yet access overall is still very low, and prevalence was consistently higher among more advantaged groups.Keywords: endosseous dental implantation, prevalence, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, projection, cross-sectional studies, dental care ","Introduction The  concept  of  osseointegration  was  introduced  nearly  50  y  ago (Brånemark et al. 1969). Since then, implant dentistry has developed from an experimental invention to a successful and predictable  treatment  modality  for  replacing  missing  teeth  (Buser  et  al.  2017).  Dental  implants  have  gained  popularity  because,  in  contrast  to  other  treatment  modalities,  they  preserve adjacent tooth structure and bone (Jivraj and Chee 2006; Battle-Siatita et al. 2009). Moreover, implant rehabilitation for patients  who  are  edentulous  and  partially  edentulous  report-edly  enhances  masticatory  function  and  quality  of  life  (Tang  et al. 1999; Jofre et al. 2013; Hartlev et al. 2014). Therefore, dental implants have become an important treatment option for replacing missing teeth (Tarnow 2014; Buser et al. 2017).Little is known about the prevalence of dental implant use among the US population (Alkan et al. 2018). There is a general  impression  that  use  of  implants  has  been  increasing,  and  market research indicates that the overall number of implants used has been increasing. What has not been documented is the temporal trend in the proportion of patients receiving implants when  they  are  missing  teeth.  Evaluating  current  and  future  trends  in  the  prevalence  of  implants  is  important  for  understanding potential health disparities in access to this treatment and could also assist in the allocation of health care resources. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to describe trends in the prevalence of dental implants among adults in the United States from 1999 to 2016 and in the sociodemographic characteristics of implant recipients over time. The secondary objective was to project implant prevalence to the years 2021 and 2026 under several simple, realistic scenarios. Materials and Methods We  analyzed  data  from  the  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey  (NHANES),  conducted  by  the  National Center  for  Health  Statistics  (Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention 2017). NHANES is a cross-sectional stratified mul-tistage  probability-sampled  survey  of  the  civilian  noninstitutionalized population of the United States, conducted annually beginning  in  1999.  NHANES  surveys  include  information  about  participants’  racial/ethnic  background,  socioeconomic  position, and health conditions. Participants also undergo clinical examination, including a detailed oral examination of tooth condition,  tooth  count,  periodontal  status,  occlusion,  dental  treatment needs, and overall oral health status.We used data from 7 NHANES surveys conducted between 1999  and  2016,  excluding  participants  <18  y  old  and  those  without a dental examination (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017). Regarding implant prevalence, all individuals missing ≥1 permanent teeth were eligible for analyses (N=32,758).The  study  outcome  was  the  proportion  of  individuals  receiving at least 1 dental implant—a whole-mouth binary outcome  (any  implant  present  or  absent)  derived  from  32  tooth-level   indicators   of   condition.   We   use   the   term   implant prevalence in this study to indicate the number of individuals who have at least 1 dental implant among all of those with at least 1 missing tooth. We also created 2 indicators of implant location: by dental arch (maxilla or mandible) and by the position in the arch (anterior or posterior).For sociodemographic variables, we categorized education into high school degree or less versus greater than a high school education  and  race  into  White  versus  non-White.  Because  NHANES assessed educational attainment only for adults aged ≥20  y,  this  was  a  further  age  restriction  for  analyses  that  included education. For comparability across surveys, we col-lapsed  health  insurance  variables  into  3  categories:  private,  public, and no insurance.Statistical Analysis We  estimated  the  survey-weighted  proportion  of  individuals  receiving at least 1 implant for each survey period overall and stratified  by  sex,  age,  education,  race,  and  insurance  status,  with  95%  CIs.  Additionally,  we  stratified  implant  prevalence  by dental arch, location in the arch, and tooth position. We estimated changes in prevalence over time by calculating absolute and  relative  differences  from  1999–2000  to  2015–2016.  We  also estimated the independent associations of each characteristic  with  the  presence  of  any  implant,  in  a  survey-weighted  multivariable logistic regression model that included NHANES year and participants’ age, sex, education level, race, and insurance type. We evaluated whether the temporal trend in implant prevalence was different according to these same characteristics by adding multiplicative interaction terms in separate models (e.g., sex × year or education × year).Before  projecting  the  proportion  of  people  treated  with  implants  5  and  10  y  out  from  the  last  NHANES  data  set,  we  compared the average annual change in log odds of having an implant  between  the  unadjusted  and  covariate-adjusted  models, and the difference was negligible. Because there was little evidence of confounding by sociodemographic factors, including  age,  we  used  unadjusted  logistic  regression  models  to  regress  presence  of  any  implant  versus  year.  After  fitting  the  model,  we  added  new  observations  for  the  years  2021  and  2026  and  derived  predicted  values  (and  corresponding  95%  prediction interval; StataCorp 2013; Inlow 2018) for all years. To  vary  assumptions  about  how  the  temporal  trend  would  be  predicted  to  continue  into  the  years  2021  and  2026,  we  proposed  4  simple  scenarios.  Specifically,  we  assumed  that  the  increase in implant prevalence would 1) stop, 2) slow, 3) continue at the same pace, or 4) continue at an increased pace. We operationalized  these  assumptions  by  varying  which  years  were included in the model fitting. For all 4 scenarios, we used logistic regression to regress the presence of any implant versus year. For the first scenario, we assumed that the proportion of eligible patients with any implant would remain the same as the  fitted  value  (i.e.,  average  probability  estimated  by  the  regression line for all years) in 2015 to 2016. For the other 3 scenarios,  we  predicted  the  future  prevalence  based  on  the  slope of the regression line, using all years from 2000 to 2016 for scenario 2, excluding 2015 to 2016 in scenario 3 (in case it was aberrantly high), and excluding 1999 to 2000 and 2001 to 2002 in scenario 4 (because the proportion with implants did not really start taking off until 2003 to 2004 or later). We plotted all observed percentages, fitted percentages, and projected percentages  over  time  (in  years).  Because  we  did  not  adjust  these  models  for  covariates,  the  projected  populations  are  assumed to have similar population distributions by age, insurance type, and so on. We know that this assumption may not be true. However, we picked several otherwise realistic scenarios that provide a range of rough estimates for implant use through 2026. The least realistic scenario is also the most conservative, predicting  that  the  increase  in  prevalence  of  implants  might  abruptly stop.We  used  survey  weights  to  account  for  the  complex  survey  design  in  making  population  inferences.  We  analyzed  the  data  with  STATA  13  (StataCorp  2013).  This  study  was  reviewed  by  the institutional review board of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public   Health   and   determined   to   be   “not-human   subjects   research” since the data are publicly available and de-identified.Results Among US adults aged ⩾18 y in this study, 32,758 had at least 1 missing tooth, and 618 had at least 1 implant (Table 1). The majority of that sample were women (56%) and had received greater than a high school education (77%). Twenty-eight per-cent were in the age category of 65 to 77 y; most were White (80%);   and   around   54%   had   private   health   insurance.   Compared  with  these  distributions,  adults  with  missing  teeth  but without implants had a slightly lower proportion of women and a much lower proportion of those who had greater than a high  school  education  (59%),  were  White  (70%),  and  had  health insurance (public + private: 83% vs. 95%).There  has  been  a  substantial  increase  in  the  proportion  of  individuals receiving implants in the United States. From 1999  to  2000,  the  prevalence  of  implants  among  adults  missing at least  1  tooth  was  0.7%  (95%  CI  =  0.4%  to  1.2%).  A  pronounced  increase  in  prevalence  was  not  seen  until  2009  to  2010 (1.9%, 95% CI = 1.4% to 2.5%), and the prevalence was 5.7% (95% CI = 4.1% to 7.7%) from 2015 to 2016. A similar increasing  trend  did  occur  across  all  socio demographic  variables examined, including sex, age, education, race, and health insurance (Table 2). Since 1999, the largest absolute increase (12.9%) in implant prevalence was among those 65 to 74 y old, while the largest relative increase was 1,034% among those 55 to 64 y old.Roughly  half  the  implants  were  placed  in  the  mandible  (51%, 95% CI = 45% to 57%) and half in the maxilla (49%, 95% CI = 43% to 55%), although the percentage placed in the mandible  was  at  times  slightly  higher  or  lower  than  50%  depending  on  the  survey  year  (Fig.  1).  Additionally,  most  implants  were  placed  in  posterior  sites,  except  for  1999  to  2000, when nearly 54% (95% CI = 32% to 75%) were placed in  anterior  sites.  When  stratified  by  site,  the  most  common  tooth to be replaced by an implant was number 19 (18%, 95% CI =  14%  to  22%)  or  number  30  (17%,  95%  CI  =  13%  to  22%; Appendix).From  1999–2000  to  2015–2016,  there  was  an  average  covariate-adjusted  14%  increase  in  implant  prevalence  per  year  (95%  CI  =  11%  to  18%)  (Table  3).  Independent  of  the  temporal  trend,  specific  characteristics  were  associated  with  greater  implant  use,  including  almost  a  13-fold  increase  in  implant prevalence for older adults (65 to 74 y) as compared with younger adults (18 to 34 y) (95% CI = 8 to 21). In addition,  having  private  insurance  and  greater  than  a  high  school  education was each associated with a 2-fold increase in implant prevalence. No subgroup differences in trend met significance thresholds of P< 0.05 (not shown). Descriptively, among age groups, the temporal trend was much stronger for people 65 to 74 y, and there was a much slower increase in implant prevalence  among  those  with  no  medical  insurance  versus  those  with public or private insurance, as well as among people with a high school education or less versus those having greater than a high school education (Appendix Fig).In only the most conservative scenario would dental implant prevalence projected to the year 2026 be <10% (Fig. 2). If the trend continues at the current pace, a jump from 5.7% to 17% can be expected by 2026 (95% CI = 11% to 27%). If the trend steepens,  prevalence  could  reach  23%  (95%  CI  =  13%  to  39%). Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe and project population  trends  in  the  prevalence  of  dental  implants  in  the  United   States.   We   used   nationally   representative   data   to   describe the prevalence of dental implants among adults missing  at  least  1  tooth,  as  well  as  associations  with  socio demographic  characteristics.  There  was  a  large  increase  in  the  prevalence  of  dental  implants  from  1999  to  2016.  Although  this  trend  was  generally  observed  for  all  sociodemographic  indicators in this study, it was most pronounced among older adults and was much slower to change among adults without health insurance or with only a high school education or less.Across years, adults with higher than a high school education and of White race were more likely to have received dental implants.  There  was  also  a  wide  gap  in  implant  prevalence between adults with and without health insurance. A major barrier for receiving dental implants is the high cost (Zimmer et al. 1992; Christensen 2012). In the United States, public insurance does  not  cover  dental  implants,  and  depending  on  the  dental  plan,  private  insurance  may  cover  only  part  of  the  total  cost.  Additionally, the lack of availability of dentists with sufficient implant  training  (Christensen  2012)  and  patients’  knowledge  about this treatment option may be contributing to this disparity (Deeb et al. 2017).These  results  highlight  the  increased  adoption  of  dental  implants in the current treatment of missing teeth; growth that has  been  fueled  in  part  by  scientific  advances  in  the  field  of  implant  dentistry  (Buser  et  al.  2017).  Very  few  studies  have  been  designed  to  examine  trends  in  the  prevalence  or  use  of  dental implants. However, there is a growing body of literature regarding  specific  aspects  of  dental  implant  use,  such  as  implant  design,  material,  and  clinical  behavior,  that  suggests  an   increase   in   implant   utilization   (Annibali   et   al.   2012;   Papaspyridakos  et  al.  2012;  Pieralli  et  al.  2017).  Marketing  research has also indicated that the overall number of implants sold  has  been  increasing  and  that  market  share  in  North  America  is  less  than  that  of  other  regions  of  the  world—as  compared  with,  for  example,  Europe,  which  dominated  the  market in 2016 (Grand View Research, Inc. 2018). Our analysis  complements  the  market  research  in  that  we  examined  trends  in  the  prevalence  of  the  use  of  implants  among  US  patients who appear to be eligible to receive them. The results highlight not only a health disparity but also a gap in market penetration.Although, in general, the risk of losing teeth has decreased over the last few decades (Wu et al. 2014), the US population is  aging.  These  factors  will  likely  combine  such  that  the  demand  for  dental  implants  will  continue  to  rise  in  the  next  decade.  If  the  observed  trend  continues  at  an  average  rate similar to that observed since 2003 to 2004, projection models suggest that among adults missing teeth, the prevalence of dental implant use could reach as high as 23% by the year 2026.We  used  a  simplified  projection  approach,  and  the  results  must be interpreted accordingly. The goal of the prediction was simply  to  document  the  average  change  in  prevalence  of implant over time. Thus, we did not adjust these  regression  models  for  underlying  characteristics of the population that have changed  over  time  and  will  continue  to  change  (Muller  and  MacLehose  2014).  The most obvious expected demographic trend,   as   mentioned,   is   the   continued   aging  of  the  population,  and  because  the  risk  of  tooth  loss  increases  with  age,  we  may have underestimated implant prevalence projected to 2026. Nevertheless, the covariate-adjusted  (including  age  adjustment)  and  unadjusted  models  differed  only  negligibly  in  the  estimated  average  rate  of  change  in  prevalence  per  year.  This suggests that, though clearly related to implant use, age did not confound the temporal  trend,  supporting  the  use  and  interpretability  of  the  unadjusted  regression approach.In  future  work,  we  will  build  on  this  preliminary evidence by developing more rigorous cost-benefit  analyses  under  different  assumptions  about  demographic  and clinical trends. We will also factor in the number of missing  teeth  and  number  of  dental  implants  rather  than  using  a  simple  prevalence  estimate,  which  serves  as  an  indicator  of  access.  Although  one  might  expect  each  patient’s  probability  of any dental implants to increase with the number of missing teeth, the distribution of tooth loss itself is highly socio demographically skewed.Another  source  of  possible  underestimation  of  implant  prevalence is that we included adults missing any teeth, including  third  molars.  Although  third  molars  are  rarely  replaced,  initial  descriptive  analyses  indicated  that  close  to  1%  of  all  dental  implants  in  this  study  were  placed  at  the  third  molar  location; thus, we included them in the analysis.Tooth loss affects about 52% of adults in the United States (Dye et al. 2015). Despite an overall decrease in its prevalence, tooth loss remains a prevalent dental condition that is unequally distributed  among  the  population.  Disparities  by  sociodemographic  status  have  been  documented,  and  adults  from  disadvantaged  groups  consistently  experience  a  greater  burden  of  this condition (Cunha-Cruz et al. 2007; Elani et al. 2012; Peres et  al.  2015;  Elani  et  al.  2017).  Tooth  loss  negatively  affects  chewing ability, quality of life, and aesthetics, and the extent of this  impact  depends  on  the  number  of  missing  teeth  and  their  location  (Sheiham  and  Steele  2001;  Gerritsen  et  al.  2010).  Options  for  dental  treatments  to  replace  missing  teeth  vary  depending on the severity of tooth loss, the condition of remaining  teeth,  alveolar  ridge  condition,  patients’  financial  ability,  and providers’ expertise. Among the various treatment options, including  traditional  fixed  and  removable  prostheses,  dental  implants have become the most desirable treatment due to their functional and aesthetic advantages (Tarnow 2014; Buser et al. 2017). However, our findings document similar persistent disparities  for  receiving  implant  treatment.  Thus,  disadvantaged groups  are  most  vulnerable  to  having  missing  teeth  and  also  appear to lack access to this emerging dental treatment option.According to this study, only 6% of adults benefited from the  advantages  of  tooth  replacement  with  dental  implants  as  recently  as  2016.  Further  efforts  should  be  made  to  better  understand  the  factors  associated  with  this  disparity  and  to  ensure that a larger portion of the population has access to dental implant treatment. Conclusion Based  on  nationally  representative  data,  this  study  demonstrates  that  dental  implant  prevalence  among  US  adults  has  substantially increased since 1999. This trend was not uniform across sociodemographic indicators examined; implant prevalence was consistently higher among more advantaged groups. A range of reasonable projection estimates suggest that dental implant  prevalence  could  be  as  high  as  23%  by  2026.  These  findings provide valuable information for workforce development and for the implant industry to allocate resources for the anticipated future demand among patients eligible for implant treatment yet not receiving it.Author Contributions H.W.

Implementing virtual OSCE using an open-source online interactive 3D library,"Ahmed Mahrous DDS, MS, Rawa Alammari DDS, MHI, MS, Amira Elgreatly DDS, MS",-,"1 PROBLEM The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted dental education.1 Dentistry is a hands-on profession;likewise,dental education has always relied on providing hands-on material to dental students to aid in the visualization of complex structures such as dental anatomy or dental prostheses. Due to social distancing guidelines imposed by the pandemic, students have limited access to those materials. Consequently, it has become challenging to deliver information to dental students. It has also been challenging to deliver Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs)2 that rely on physical material like casts or extracted natural teeth. At the University of Iowa College of Dentistry & Dental Clinics, students learn dental anatomy through a combination of lectures and hands-on examination of a physical library of extracted natural teeth that are handled in accordance with the CDC guidelines. Several OSCEs are conducted during the dental anatomy course to assess student competence in tooth identification. When the stay-at-home orders took effect, our ability to teach tooth identification and conduct an OSCE was compromised.A solution to virtualize natural extracted teeth and make them accessible to a wide range of devices was necessary. 2 SOLUTION Natural teeth were scanned using an open architecture scanner (3 shape, Copenhagen, Denmark) then textured and detailed using the open-source 3D content-creation program; Blender (Blender Foundation, Amsterdam,Netherlands). The 3D models were meticulously detailed and textured to faithfully reproduce natural tooth anatomy(Figure1). In order to facilitate the accessibility to the 3d Models across a range of devices, a Website was created to contain the 3D models. The Dental Atlas3(Figure 2) was launched as free,online resource to facilitate the viewing of 3D models of permanent and deciduous dental anatomy. The Web-based format requires no downloads and facilitates accessibility dueto compatibility with desktop and mobile devices and all available operating systems.In order to conduct the OSCE, a combination of the 3D models, Canvas (Instructure Inc, Salt Lake City, UT, USA)and Zoom (Zoom Video Communications Inc. San Jose,CA, USA) is used. A list of links to non-identifiable 3d models is created. The links are embedded into Canvas Online tests/quizzes. A Zoom session is started alongside the Canvas test/quiz and the instructor moderates the timing of each question. Once all questions are conducted the students are to submit all quizzes (Figure3).3 RESULTSThe use of the dental atlas virtual 3D models has been found to be a useful tool in the virtual delivery of tooth identification content as well as the OSCE examination.In addition to improving spatial learning of complex structures,4the use of virtual 3D models overcomes some disadvantages of using natural teeth. Natural extracted teeth are often fractured, lost, or damaged. Natural teeth incur cost and effort to acquire and sanitize according to the CDC guidelines.5 Due to the positive feedback from students and faculty, and the success of using the dental atlas Website virtual 3D models in student instruction and conducting the virtual OSCE, there may be value in transitioning to virtual online tooth models post pandemic.

Stress in doctors and dentists who teach,"Harry Rutter, Joe Herzberg & Elisabeth Paice","Objective To explore the relationship between a teaching role and stress in doctors and dentists who teach.Methods Medline,  PubMed,  BIDS  database  for  social sciences literature, and the ERIC database for educational  literature  were  searched  using  the  key  words 'stress' or 'burnout' with  the  terms  doctor,  physician,dentist, teacher, lecturer, academic staff, and university staff. Other books and journals known to the authors were also used.Results Many studies have shown high levels of stress in doctors,   dentists,   teachers,   and   lecturers.   A   large number of factors are implicated, including low autonomy, work overload, and lack of congruence between power  and  responsibility.  Doctors  and  dentists  who take on a teaching role in addition to their clinical role may  increase  their  levels  of  stress,  but  there  is  also evidence  that  this  dual  role  may  reduce  job-related stress.Conclusions Working as a doctor or dentist may entail higher  levels  of  stress  than  are  experienced  by  the general  population.  In  some  situations  adding  in  the role of teacher reduces this stress, but more research is needed to explain this finding.

Many doctors   and   dentists   take   on   a   dual   role,   having responsibility  for  teaching  students  and  postgraduate trainees   as   well   as   caring   for   patients.   Since   the reforms   of   the   undergraduate   curriculum   and   of specialist  training,  the  teaching  and  training  responsibilities   of   consultants   have   become   much   more time-consuming,   and   may   possibly   contribute   to stress.The NHS   Plan 1 Suggests   that   the   careers   of consultants   should   be   phased   so   that   they   carry different  responsibilities  at  different  stages.  One  of the  responsibilities  which  could  be  removed from the many and delegated to a few consultants, perhaps later in  their  career,  is  the  responsibility  for  teaching  and training.  Would  such  a  separation  relieve  the  strain caused  by  carrying  too  many  roles?  Or  would  losing the   teaching   and   training   role   aggravate   stress   in doctors   and   dentists?   We   set   out   to   review   the literature  on  stress  in  doctors,  dentists  and  teachers,to  explore  whether  the  stressors  were  similar  and whether  there  was  any  evidence  that  taking  on  a teaching role aggravated or mitigated stress in doctors and  dentists.  We  carried  out  a  search  on  Medline,PubMed, BIDS database for social sciences literature,and  the   ERIC  database  for  educational  literature,using  the  key  words 'stress' or 'burnout' with  doctor⁄physician⁄dentist⁄teacher⁄lecturer⁄academic  staff⁄university  staff.  We  also  used  books,  reports  and  papers already known to us. Defining stress and burnout Stress  has  been  defined  as  a  process  which  causes  or precipitates  individuals  to  believe  they  are  unable  to cope with the situation facing them, and the feelings of anxiety,  tension,  frustration,  and  anger  which  result from the recognition that they are failing in some way and  the  situation  is  getting  out  of  their  control.2 Sustained  stress  may  lead  to  anxiety  and  depressive reactions, as well as physical health problems such as coronary  heart  disease.3A  well-validated  measure  of stress is the 12- or 28-question General Health Questionnaire  (GHQ-12,  GHQ-28),  designed  to  pick  up symptoms of psychological morbidity in populations.4 Burnout  has  been  defined  as  a  syndrome  of  emotional exhaustion, depersonalization (treating people in an  unfeeling,  impersonal  way),  and  reduced  personal accomplishment which occurs among individuals who work  with  people  in  some  capacity.  The  most  widely used  measure  for  this  is  the  Maslach  Burnout  Inventory.5 Stress in doctors and dentists Many  studies  have  shown  high  levels  of  stress  in doctors,  with  psychological  morbidity  ranging  from 19% to 47%,6–9 compared with a rate of around 18%for the general employed population.10A  questionnaire  study  of  1133  consultants  carried out   by   Ramirezet al.associated   stress   with   work overload,  followed  by  feeling  poorly  managed  andresourced;   managerial   responsibilities;   dealing   with patients’  suffering;  keeping  up  to  date;  being  responsible for the quality of work of other staff, and having to deal   with   relatives.11 Those   who   felt   insufficiently trained in management and communication expressed higher  levels  of  depersonalization  and  lower  levels  of personal accomplishment than those who felt adequately   trained.   Job   satisfaction   was   protective against job stress and depersonalization, with autonomy and feeling well managed and resourced acting as major contributors to job satisfaction.An  in-depth  exploration  of  some  of  the  factors causing  stress  was  carried  out  by  Allenet al.through a   series   of   focus   group   discussions   with   hospital consultants.12The  researchers  found  that  the  role  of the consultant had become increasingly complex, with increasing demands from a variety of sources along with greater accountability to a variety of stakeholders. For example, Royal Colleges and postgraduate deans were demanding ever higher standards of trainee supervision,while the service contribution  of trainees was steadily eroded   by   reductions   in   their   working   hours   and duration  of  training.  These  responsibilities  had  been  imposed  on consultants  who felt decreasing  power  to influence  the  means  by  which  they  could  best  be handled.  The  consultants  felt  themselves  to  be  ultimately accountable in terms of patient care but without the power to determine how these services were to be delivered.  The  greatest  rewards  in  terms  of  job  satisfaction were provided by patients but they also caused some of the greatest stress in that they were increasingly demanding of time and energy, had unrealistic expectations, were increasingly aggressive and, perhaps most stressful of all, were more and more likely to complain.Lack of congruence between power and responsibility was again an important theme, which is echoed in other reports showing that lack of autonomy, lack of control over   work,   and   reduced   participation   in   decision-making are important factors causing stress and anxiety in doctors.13–15In studies of general practitioners, the four stressors most predictive of job dissatisfaction and stress were the demands  of  the  job  and  patients’  expectations;  interference with family life; constant interruption at work and home, and practice administration.16,17 Dentists  have  similar  levels  of  stress  and  depression.18In an interview study, the factors which dental practitioners  referred  to  most  often  as  causing  stress were system changes in running a dental practice, andrising  patient  expectations.  Staff  turnover,  financial worries, a feeling  of  having to see too many patients,aggression  from  patients,  litigation  and  the  stress  of working  with  other  team  members  were  also  cited.19 Working with colleagues may be a source of stress, butso is isolation.20 Stress, burnout, and depression must be a matter of concern  in  professions  where  humanity,  compassion and competence are such essential attributes.More  information  about  some  of  these  studies  is shown in Table 1.Stress in teachers and lecturers Levels of stress and depression in school teachers have been  shown  to  be  as  high  or  higher  than  those  in doctors   and   dentists.21 Many   of   the   stressors   are similar: workload, lack of resources, poor relationships with colleagues, unrealistic expectations from managers and difficult interactions with pupils and parents.22A study of 1110 school teachers in Canada showed correlations    between    isolation    and    occupational stress.23 Another large Canadian study found a relationship between bureaucratic interference and emotional exhaustion; this in turn was related to greater depersonalization,  feelings  of  lower  personal  accomplishment,and greater somatization.24 Other studies have shown stress in teachers to be related to working hours,25 role overload,26 and concerns such as pupil misbehaviour,time⁄resource    difficulties,    professional    recognition needs, workload and poor relationships.27 Stressors in higher education, including medical and dental  education,  where  students  are  more  likely  to have made a positive decision to attend and teachers are likely to have competing demands in terms of academic productivity,  differ  from  those  in  school  level  education. Explorations of the roles and stress in academic life  have  been  extensively  described  by  Fisher,  who noted that university staff are expected to teach, meet tutorial, laboratory or seminar commitments and at the same time carry out research, run experiments, obtain research funding, and write papers and books.28 Academic staff have traditionally enjoyed a high degree of personal control over their jobs, but this has diminished in  recent  years.  The  development  of  the  research assessment  exercise  in  the  United  Kingdom,  whichlinks  university  income  with  research  achievements,creates  significant  pressure  to  perform  research  and seek  funds  with  which  to  do  this,  at  the  expense  of teaching. In addition to academic demands from their employers, there are increasing demands from students,whose views of what constitutes good performance may differ from those of their teaching staff.29 Teaching has been subjected to a prolonged period of change in recent years. Teachers have been required to assimilate changes, modify their behaviour and evaluate success   by   assessing   the   progress   of   their   pupils.Travers & Cooper surveyed a random sample of 1790 teachers  drawn  from  a  cross-section  of  school  types,sectors  and  teaching  grades  across  the  UK.30 they found   that   this   group   of   teachers   reported   more manifestations of stress than comparable occupational groups,  including  general  practitioners  and  dentists.The top ten sources of pressure for this group were lack of  support  from  the  government;  constant  changes taking place within the profession; lack of information as  to  how  the  changes  were  to  be  made;  society’diminishing respect for the profession; the move toward a  national  curriculum;  salary  out  of  proportion  to workload;  having  to  produce  assessments  of  pupils;dealing with basic behavioural problems; lack of non-contact time, and the fact of being a good teacher not necessarily meaning promotion. The two major predictors of job dissatisfaction were the management structure of the school and lack of status or promotion. The NHS doctor or dentist with a teaching or training role would recognise many of the same factors.Stress in doctors and dentists who teachIf high levels of stress are a feature of both health care and teaching, then are stress levels even higher in those who  combine  the  roles?  Harden  has  suggested  that there   are   particular   pressures   on  medical   teachers which involve changes in health care delivery, in public expectations and in medical education.31He has drawn together the interacting factors causing stress in medical teachers  in  the  form  of  a  complex  equation.  The stressors involved in the equation include the teaching workload, the number of teaching weeks, the number of students,  the  intensity  of  teaching,  the  tasks  to  be undertaken  by  the  teacher  and  the  number  of  staff;additional   factors   included   the   clinical   workload,research  activities  and  administrative  workload.  The equation also incorporates other factors, such as loss of teacher   autonomy,   role   conflict,   rewards   and   job satisfaction,  available  resources  and  forms  of  support for the teacher. In particular, increasing demands are being made on the teacher in medicine with regard to student assessment. Postgraduate training for junior doctors has recently been   reformed   adding   to   the   pressures   on   their consultants.32,33 The reforms were intended to shorten the  time  it  took  to  train  consultants  in  the  UK,  by improving  the  structure  and  content  of  training  programmes. They were intended to be accompanied by an increase in the number of consultants, but this increase has  not  so  far  materialized.  The  reforms  have  led  to more  work;  further  loss  of  autonomy  for  consultants,who can no longer appoint their own trainees, and the threat  of  losing  recognition  for  training  if  externally imposed standards are not met.12The introduction of aformalÔrecord of in-training assessmentÕhas increased the burden on consultant trainers. They must provide objective   reports  about   the   trainee’s   progress,   but writing  an  adverse  report  and  discussing  it  with  the trainee can be stressful. Further, the trainer who agrees to take on a trainee who has been identified as poorly performing carries a heavy burden of responsibility to his or her peers and patients, as well as to the trainee.34 Despite all this, we could not find any research which demonstrated that doctors and dentists with undergraduate  or  postgraduate  teaching  responsibilities  were any more stressed than their peers.Factors which reduce stress Teachers  who  take  a  course  in  human  relations  may suffer  less  stress.35Hallet al.studied  32  male  and female teachers and found that following such a course there was a reduction in reported stress, indications of amore humanistic orientation towards pupil control, andan increased sense of an internal locus of control.An  American  study  reported  on  subjects  recruited from   a   University   teaching   programme   who   were assigned  to  meditation  training  or  a  control  group.36The  meditation  group  subjects  were  found  to  have significantly  reduced  stress  symptoms  compared  with those in the control group.In Sweden, a stress control programme was targeted at  high  school  teachers.37A  treatment  group  of  56 teachers   followed   the   programme,   which   involved discussions about various aspects of stress. Compared With  a  control  group  of  33  teachers,  the  programme participants  reported significantly  less  stress  following the programme.Senior faculty members in a Californian college were invited to an off-campus retreat to identify policies and practices  which  served  as  a  bridge  or  barrier  to  their own professional development.38 Following these meetings, specific action was taken to create projects to bring lecturers  to  campus  to  assist  tenured  female  faculty members  in  completing  their  doctoral  dissertations,and  to  restructure  a  compulsory  beginning  of  term faculty meeting to include discussion of educationally related topics.A  study  of  black  women  lecturers  in  Botswana 39 identified  the  role  of  positive  thinking,  a  form  of cognitive therapy, as a stress treatment measure.Although excessive workload was a constant theme in studies  of  stress  in  teachers  and  doctors,  effective interventions may involve extra work or responsibilities.Chinese secondary school teachers 40 found that teachers who took on additional pastoral duties felt a greater sense of accomplishment than others, despite having to work harder.Successful techniques for reducing stress in dentistsincludedÔswitching   offÕfrom   dentistry   and   taking exercise.18 General  practitioners  in  partnerships  were less depressed than those who worked in single-handed practices,   and   those   who   had   half-days   free   had significantly  lower  depression  scores  than  those  who did not.41 A  review  of  research  on  stressed  doctors highlighted   the   importance   of   protecting   time   for practitioners’ own professional development, informing employers  if  working  conditions  or  hours  were  unacceptably   stressful,   and   recognising   the   benefits   of interprofessional working.42 Can a teaching role mitigate stress in doctors and dentists?There  is  evidence  that  the  teaching  role  may  reduce stress.  A  recent  survey  of  stressors  affecting  psychiatrists   revealed   that   teaching   medical   students   and doctors  caused  them  little  or  no  stress.43In  a  survey of  general  practitioners,  the  degree  of  involvement  intraining  was  inversely  related  to  depression  scores.There  was  also  a  significant  association  between  low anxiety scores and being involved in training.41 Why should a teaching role mitigate stress in doctors?One factor may be professional status and peer recognition. Wrightet al.surveyed trainees at four teaching hospitals in the USA and asked them to name physicians   whom   they   considered   to   be   excellent   role models.44 Five attributes were found to be independently  associated  with  being  an  excellent  role  model:spending  more  than  25%  of  time  teaching;  spending 25 hours or more per  week teaching, and conducting rounds  during  time  spent  as  an  attending  physician;stressing the importance of the doctor–patient relationship during teaching; teaching psychosocial aspects of medicine,   and   having   served   as   a   chief   resident.Promotion  prospects  may  be  improved  by  an  active teaching  role.  In  a  study  of  factors  associated  with promotion of academic staff within medical schools in the USA and Canada, teaching skills, clinical skills and mentoring  skills  were  the  three  most  highly  ranked.45The authors concluded that most, but not all, promotion committees assign high importance to the special contributions of clinician-educators.Frederick  Herzberg  highlighted  the  value  of  job enrichment  in  improving  job  satisfaction  and  motivation.46 He  suggested  that,  paradoxically,  adding  new responsibilities   could   motivate   employees   to   work harder, if as a consequence  they gained more control over their environment.For professionals motivated by the desire toÔmake adifferenceÕ, training young doctors to treat a condition seems more productive than simply doing the treating oneself.47 In  the  UK,  medical  consultants  who  were also clinical tutors or directors of education, and hence significantly involved with the management of medical education,  were  more  positive  about  their  work  than other consultants. These doctors had their own place of retreat, their own budgets, their own staff and their own specific roles, and these led to a sense of control and autonomy despite the increased work involved.12 Discussion We  found no  evidence  in  our  review  of  the  literature that  doctors  and  dentists  with  teaching  or  training responsibilities were any more stressed than their non-teaching counterparts. On the contrary, there was some evidence that a teaching or training role might mitigate stress.  The  reasons  for  this  must  be  speculative,  but might include lessened isolation, increased self-esteem in  response  to  the  attention  of  students,  a  sense  of autonomy  over  what  and  when  to  teach,  power  over those  in  a  more  junior  position,  added  interest  inpatients  as  a  source  of  teaching  opportunities,  and  a sense  of  helping  the  future  patients  of  those  being taught.The evidence for the impact of a teaching role on job-related  stress  is  confusing.  Teaching  and  academic work  involve  exposure  to  stresses  such  as  potentially reduced  status;  increased  external  policing  (e.g.  by academic assessors), and thus reduced autonomy, and altered interpersonal relationships with colleagues such as trainees. There is, however, a more positive side to the  teaching  role,  which  may  also  be  associated  with increased status, more autonomy, and greater occupational variety and interest. It seems likely that teaching does not influence job-related stress per se, rather it is the  personal  and  professional  circumstances  affecting that teacher which are of most importance. There are,for example, enormous differences in both the clinical and  the  teaching  role  between  a  teaching  hospital consultant,  a  general  practice  trainer,  and  a  junior doctor   providing ad   hoc teaching   for   his   or   her colleagues on the ward.Much  of  the  evidence  cited  in  this  review  can  be criticised on several grounds. Sample sizes are small in many  of  the  studies,  some  of  which  also  have  low response  rates,  and  a  number  of  papers  demonstrate clear  selection  bias.  Chambers’  paper,  for  example,compares the health and lifestyles of GPs and teachers,but it is based on small sample sizes and low response rates, which reduces the reliability of its conclusions.21 The generalizability of much of the published data can also   be   questioned,   given   the   narrowness   of   the selection   criteria   shown   in   several   of   the   papers mentioned.    McManus et al.have    criticised    the research  on  stress  in  doctors  on  the  grounds  that published  papers  may  exaggerate  stress  as  a  consequence  of  questionnaires  that  specifically  focused  on stress,  thus  creating  a  demand  characteristic.48 Their research using the GHQ-12 demonstrates lower levels of  stress  among  doctors  than  those  found  in  other studies,  and  which  are  equivalent  to  levels  in  the general  population,  but  they  acknowledge  that  the comparison  can  only  be  approximate  because  of  arange of confounding factors.Conclusions This  review  of  current  literature  reveals  a  number  of gaps in understanding of the factors involved in occupational stress in doctors and dentists, and the association between these factors and a teaching role. Further Research is required to tease out these links, identify both positive and negative factors implicated in job-related stress,  clarify  any  causal  relationships  that  may  exist,and accurately establish the prevalence of stress within these professions. The relationship between a teaching role and job-related stress remains poorly understood,and research is needed to disentangle the general from the  specific  factors.  Teachers  at  certain  medical  and dental  schools  may,  for  example,  experience  much higher or lower job-related stress than those at others,as  a  result  of  particular  cultural  or  organizational circumstances, and these need to be separated out from generic  factors  applicable  to  all  such  establishments.Comparison   should   also   be   made   across   different teaching and learning environments, from medical and dental schools to hospitals and primary care practices.The  time  is  long  overdue  for  moving  away  from  a professional culture that accepts and expects job-related stress as an inevitability, and to concentrate on improving the working conditions of all in the profession.Contributors JH and EP performed the original literature review and wrote  the  first  draft.

Use of a structured approach and virtual simulation practice to improve diagnostic reasoning,"Michael Dekhtyar, Yoon Soo Park, Judy Kalinyak, Saumil M. Chudgar,Kelly Bossenbroek Fedoriw, Khadeja J. Johnson, Craig F. Knoche, Lisa Martinez, Nina Mingioni,Amber T. Pincavage, Rachel Salas, Fred Sanfilippo, Stephen M. Sozio, Nancy Weigle,Sarah Wood, Jillian Zavodnick and Scott Stern","Objectives: In 2015, the National Academy of Medicine IOM estimated that 12 million patients were misdiagnosed annually. This suggests that despite prolonged training in medical school and residency there remains a need to improve diagnostic reasoning education. This study evaluates a new approach.Methods:A total of 285 medical students were enrolled in this 8 center, IRB approved trial. Students were randomized to receive training in either abdominal pain (AP) or loss of consciousness (LOC). Baseline diagnostic accuracy of the two different symptoms was assessed by completing a multiple-choice question (MCQ) examination and virtual patient encounters. Following a structured educational intervention, including a lecture on the diagnostic approach to that symptom and three virtual patient practice cases,each student was re-assessed.Results:The change in diagnostic accuracy on virtual patient encounters was compared between (1) baseline and post intervention and (2) post intervention students trained in the prescribed symptom vs. the alternate symptom (controls). The completeness of the student’differential diagnosis was also compared. Comparison of proportions were conducted usingχ2-tests. Mixed-effects regressions were used to examine differences accounting for case and repeated measures. Compared with baseline,both the AP and LOC groups had marked post-intervention improvements in obtaining a correct final diagnosis; a 27% absolute improvement in the AP group(p<0.001) and a 32% absolute improvement in the LOC group (p<0.001). Compared with controls (the groups trained in the alternate symptoms), the rate of correct diagnoses increased by 13% but was not statistically significant (p=0.132). The completeness and efficiency of the differential diagnoses increased by 16% (β=0.37,p<0.001) and 17% respectively (β=0.45, p<0.001).Conclusions:The study showed that a virtual patient platform combined with a diagnostic reasoning framework could be used for education and diagnostic assessment and improved correct diagnosis compared with baseline performance in a simulated platform.Keywords:clinical reasoning; diagnostic error; education; simulation.","Introduction As part of their Quality Chasm Series, the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the IOM) released a report to broaden health care professions’understanding of diagnostic error, defined as“the failure to (a) establish an accurate and timely explanation of the patient’s health problem(s)...”One of the salient recommendations of this report was to“enhance health care professional education and training in the diagnostic process.”The report highlighted a key issue: health professions education currently does not emphasize training in clinical reasoning [1].To enhance training in diagnostic reasoning, it might be helpful to develop a process to supplement the traditional apprenticeship model. A number of ideal objectives would be helpful for this new supplemental approach.They are: (1) an objective, reproducible way to measure diagnostic reasoning defined as the application of medical knowledge to diagnose a patient, (2) the use of medical evidence as the bases for diagnostic reasoning education,and (3), scalable to facilitate widespread utilization.The first goal,an objective,reproducible way to measure diagnostic reasoning efficacy that best mimics a real patient encounter might be provided with technology-enhanced learning or virtual simulation. Ideally this simulation platform should replicate all components of the diagnostic process with a patient, including active data acquisition from the history, physical exam, and tests ordered and then assessing each of those components in addition to the final diagnosis.Additionally, the platform should provide case specific, stu-dent  specific  feedback  to  enhance  learning.  To  further encourage  adoption,  this  platform  should  be  scalable.Finally, to maximize efficacy, this platform should facilitate the authoring of a large variety of cases including new diagnoses such as COVID-19.Of the technology platforms available,  i-Human  Patients  interactive,  virtual  patient application fulfilled these requirements without the need of anything more than a device with browser access.The second objective, a structured, diagnostic reasoning process based on medical evidence, is available in the form of the Symptom to Diagnosis (S2D) educational framework developed by Stern and colleagues [2]. The textbook emphasizes a stepwise algorithmic approach to evaluate patients based on pivotal concepts supported by published medical literature.This study tested the hypothesis that the S2D diagnostic reasoning approach videos paired with practice virtual  patient  encounter  simulations  (VPES)  could improve the diagnostic accuracy in medical students as evidenced by their ability to diagnose new simulated case with diagnoses not previously encountered. Subjects and methods Participants and funding The American Medical Association (AMA) acted as the Contract Research Organization (CRO) from September 2017 through June of 2018 by: recruiting eight United States medical schools, obtaining university IRB approval, over-seeing development and administration of study protocol,data collection and analysis. Five schools made this a required portion of their curriculum, while three allowed students to volunteer. All participating students were in the late phase of the second year or in the early medicine clerkships of their third year. Duration of access to cases varied by institution to accommodate each schools’academic calendars. Institutions could use grant funds to offer additional incentives to enroll participants. The study was funded by the Marcus foundation.Diagnostic reasoning approach The symptoms of abdominal pain (AP) and loss of consciousness (LOC) were chosen for the study because the diagnostic approaches and complexity differ substantially,providing  distinct  challenges  in  teaching  diagnostic reasoning. Specifically, the diagnostic approach to AP was thought to be more intuitive and straightforward (focusing on the location and time course of the pain) whereas the diagnostic approach to LOC is more complex with the need to both distinguish syncope from non-syncope as well as distinguish the differing types of syncope.Virtual simulation platformi-Human Patients was used. IHP provided the ability to create an evidentiary medical database to guide and support authoring of VPES that supported the S2D diagnostic reasoning approach. The software collects each diagnostic reasoning decision made throughout a patient encounter such as: (1) questions asked of the virtual patient in the history, (2) physical exams performed, (3) differential diagnoses list, (4) tests ordered, (5) application of pivotal concepts and (6) accuracy of final diagnosis. A treatment plan is also requested, but was not scored for this study.The differential diagnosis list was evaluated for both completeness and efficiency. Completeness was defined as the percentage of the case authors’differential diagnoses that the student correctly identified. Efficiency assesses the ability of the student to appropriately narrow their differential diagnosis list. The efficiency was calculated as the number of appropriate diseases included in the student’s differential diagnosis divided by the total number of diseases they included.Automated qualitative and quantitative feedback was provided to the student in the intervention phase. Each symptom had at least 10 different VPES cases with uniquefinal diagnoses.Study design The study comprised three phases: (1) baseline knowledge and diagnostic reasoning assessment. (2) Randomization of students into the AP or LOC training groups, followed by training in the assigned symptom and (3) post-intervention knowledge and diagnostic reasoning assessment (Figure 1).The  randomization  allowed  students’accuracy  to  be compared with baseline as well as compared with students assigned to the alternate symptom who served as controls.Participation time was on average 16 h for learning the platform and study completion.At baseline, the students’knowledge was assessed using a multiple-choice question (MCQ) knowledge examination developed by faculty representatives from each participating institution using a test blueprint and standards for item-writing (Paniagua, 2016) [3]. Test questions were clinical vignettes with a focus on diagnosis and were unique for pre and post intervention assessment but of similar difficulty. Diagnostic competencies for AP and LOC were assessed by the completion of a simulated patient case for each symptom.For the intervention, students were randomized to APor LOC. Students were trained in their assigned symptomusing (1) lecture and (2) practice cases with that symptom. The≈2-h lecture was pre-recorded and articulated a specific diagnostic approach to the student’s assigned symptom (AP or LOC). Subsequently, the students practiced this approach on three different VPES (with different final diagnoses) that included a 5-min video explanation at case completion that summarized and reiterated the pivotal concepts.The post-intervention assessment included completion of another MCQ knowledge examination and a VPES case for both symptoms, so that the AP group served as a control for the LOC group and vice versa. Selected cases represented a broad scope of possible diagnoses including must-not-miss and common diseases (see Appendix). Post-intervention cases were selected to be different from the simulated cases that students encountered during training to evaluate their ability to extrapolate the learned approaches to other diseases, rather than simply use illness script recognition.To avoid inadvertently favoring the intervention, post-intervention cases were selected to be of similar or greater difficulty than the pre-intervention cases. Case difficulty was assigned by participating faculty based on whether the diseases were common or rare, the presentation was typical or atypical, and whether test results were concordant or discordant. Case authors for each symptom used in this study reached consensus for the case-specific differential diagnosis.Study engagement The research team hypothesized that student engagement would influence the impact of the intervention. Engagement was measured with objective measures (symptom video viewing time and case play duration) and learner-reported subjective measures (five-point Likert-type scale of learner rating of case-play effort). Confirmatory factor analysis generated an engagement score, checking for model fit indices (comparative fit index=0.92, standardized root mean squared residual=0.045). Students were categorized into three groups based on their engagement scores obtained through confirmatory factor analysis post-estimation: (1) low (34.4% of participants), (2) moderate(25.3% of participants), and (3) high (40.3% participants).Statistical analysis Data were extracted from the platform and compiled. The Internal consistency reliability of the knowledge assessments were examined using Cronbach’s alpha. Descriptive statistics were used to examine overall trends in data and changes in performance across study phases. Chi-squared tests were used to test for proportional differences andt-tests for mean comparisons. Additionally, to appreciate the magnitude of the intervention, a measure analogous to that used in therapeutic trials was calculated. In therapeutic trials, a concrete measure of the intervention’s effect is the number needed to treat, defined as the number of patients that need to be exposed to an intervention in order to prevent a single adverse outcome. Similarly, ratios of proportions were used to derive the number of students needed to train (NNT) to prevent a single incorrect final diagnosis. Mixed-effects regression models were used to examine pre-post differences, controlling for site effects and associated covariates (participation status [mandatory or  voluntary]  and  training  phase  within  school  [pre-clerkship or clerkship]); analyses also examined pre-post differences considering the specific intervention case (APor LOC). Standardizedβcoefficients were derived to allow comparisons  across  measures.  Additionally,  analyses examined effects by the three engagement-level categories.Data compilation and analyses were conducted using Stata 14 (College Station, TX). The University of Illinois at Chicago, the central review board for the AMA, and each participating site’s review board designated this study as exempt.Results Participant statistics Among 749 eligible learners, 512 students participated. Of these, 126 (25%) dropped out prior to starting the study and101 (20%) failed to complete the study. Of the 285 students who completed the study (Figure 2), 48% were female with a mean age of 25.4 years (SD=3.00). There were no significant differences in baseline performance between students who completed the study and students who dropped out. A total of 141 students were randomized to AP, and 144 were randomized to LOC intervention. There were no significant differences in baseline performance between the two groups. Internal-consistency reliability (Cronbach's Alpha) of all knowledge assessments was >0.70.Pre and post intervention total group statistics Knowledge test All-together, learners showed a 10% increase in symptom specific knowledge as determined on MCQ test performance (standardizedβ=0.77), p<0.001. Analysis by symptom found the increase in knowledge for AP increased by 17% (standardizedβ=0.92) but no significant increase in knowledge performance was found in the LOC group.History taking Between baseline and post-intervention, learners’history completeness  increased  by  3%  (standardizedβ=0.11,p<0.001) and efficiency in history taking increased by 4%(standardizedβ=0.18,  p<0.001).  Learners  with  high engagement had nearly double the impact of the intervention for completeness in history taking (standardizedβ=0.21, p<0.001). Differential diagnosis Completeness of the differential diagnoses increased by 16% (β=0.37, p<0.001). This was statistically significant for the  AP  and  LOC  subgroups  (15  and  16%  increases respectively.)Efficiency of the differential diagnoses increased by 17% (standardizedβ=0.45, p<0.001). This was statistically significant for the LOC subgroup (19% increase, p=0.013)but not the AP subgroup (14% increase, p=0.52).The overall effect size (standardizedβ)for completeness of the differential diagnosis varied by student engagement,being 0.25 for students ranked as low engagement, 0.45 for those with moderate engagement and 0.42 for those with high engagement (p<0.001). Theβfor the efficiency of the differential diagnosis also varied by engagement, being 0.32 for students ranked as low engagement, 0.45 for those ranked as moderate engagement, and 0.57 for those ranked as high engagement (p<0.001).Improvement in differential diagnosis is graphically illustrated in Figure 3. At baseline, most of the students had incomplete differential diagnoses (<50%) and were quite inefficient (<50%), as illustrated by the solid black circles.After the intervention there was an improvement in both measures. Whereas, almost none of the students were in the top right quadrant (>50% complete and efficient) prior to training, significantly more students were found in the top right quadrant after training(β=0.11, p=0.003), confirming improvement in both efficiency and completeness.Accuracy of final diagnoses: post-intervention vs. baseline At baseline (pre-intervention), the correct diagnosis rate for the two symptoms combined was 41%. After intervention, the  correct  diagnosis  rate  in  the  assigned  symptoms improved to 71%. This represents an absolute improvement of 30% (p<0.001) and a relative improvement of 58% based on theχ2-test. For the AP subgroup, the correct diagnosis rate  improved  from  65%  at  baseline  to  92%  post-intervention, a 27% absolute (p=0.049) and 71% relative improvement based on theχ2-test. In contrast, the correct diagnosis rate at baseline for LOC was only 17%. After Intervention, this improved to 49%, representing a 32%absolute and 39% relative improvement in correct diagnoses (p<0.001) Table 1.Accuracy of final diagnoses: post-intervention vs.control In addition to comparing students with their baseline performance we compared the students post intervention performance. Here students trained in their symptom were compared with students trained in the alternate symptoms who served as the control group. Although the trend favored students trained in their assigned symptom over the control group (a correct diagnosis rate of 71 vs. 58%)this was not statistically significant (p=0.132) (Table 2).Number of students needed to train to prevent one missed diagnosis The  NNT  to  prevent  one  incorrect  final  diagnosis(compared with baseline) was 3.3 overall, and 3.7 for students trained in AP, and 3.1 for students trained in LOC.Discussion Given the magnitude of diagnostic error in medical practice in the United States, it is clear that additional approaches to improve this core skill are needed and worth testing.Croskerry [4] has suggested that patients seen in internal medicine are diagnostically“undifferentiated”and that this might then lead to a higher diagnostic failure rate. A variety of suggestions have been made to improve training and decrease error, including simulations and gaming [5]and modeling the process used by expert clinicians. Cros-kerry and others argue that such clinicians use dual process reasoning. System 1 thinking utilizes illness script narratives to facilitate rapid hypothesis generation. It is fast and requires minimal cognitive load but relies on a large repertoire of ad hoc prior experiences. System 2 thinking, an analytical reasoning process, is utilized for ill-defined,  complex  cases.  Conversely,  junior  clinicians’paucity of experiences provides fewer illness scripts and in turn forces them to utilize System 2 more often than their senior colleagues [6–8]. Durning and colleagues argue that the best strategy is the one with the broadest repertoire of strategies [9] and an ideal educational strategy should facilitate both System 1 and System 2 thinking [7, 10–12].System 1 thinking could be augmented with patient simulations that increase the students’exposures to illness scripts, including uncommon but life threatening diseases[10, 13], atypical presentations, provide practice, feedback and some contextualization. This can help provide exposure to tremendous numbers of cases, that may be critical to accurate diagnoses [14]. Patient simulations can also provide practice at System 2-schema based thinking when students encounter cases whose illness script are unfamiliar. System 2 thinking could also be facilitated by well-designed lectures emphasizing a systematic content specific diagnostic approach.In their systematic review, Lambe and colleagues found only one small educational study (29 students) that evaluated the use of dual processing on diagnostic accuracy [15, 16]. The current study addresses whether an educational intervention that utilizes lectures emphasizing an analytical diagnostic approach combined with virtual patient simulations could improve diagnostic reasoning skills in a large group of medical students across multiple institutions. The study design included the use of evidence-based diagnostic reasoning approaches, which emphasizes decisions based on a content specific branching diagnostic algorithm (schema) to focus the differential diagnosis,conceptually similar to those described by Coderre [8].Additionally,   the   study   used   technology-enhanced educational practice in the form of VPES, and the selection of a cloud-based platform which made the approach easily generalizable and scalable. A total of eight institutions participated. All students were either beginning or within their clerkship rotations, therefore the study wasa supplement to any diagnostic reasoning approaches they may have had within their institutions. There was extensive discussions among the university participants on the design of a control group. Most felt it was essential that each study arm had the opportunity to experience both theS2D lectures and VPES platform. Therefore, it was felt infeasible to withhold the S2D lecture or VPES from any study arm and the decision was made to randomize students to different symptoms. This compromise in study design could be viewed as a weakness, as it would have been interesting to determine the relative impact of the S2D lectures alone vs. only the VPES with the internal“coaching or learning feedback”. This would be interesting to address in future studies.The current study showed the approach significantly improved completeness of the differential diagnoses by16% (standardizedβ=0.37), and efficiency 17% (stan-dardizedβ=0.45)  with  the  rates  of  correct  diagnosis increasing  by 30%  reflecting  moderate effects  of the intervention (all p<0.001). It is worth emphasizing that the final VPES case diagnosis was purposefully different than the students had previously encountered. This limits students’ability to use System 1 thinking (“illness script recognition”)  and  requires  the  slower  analytical  S2 approach presented in the lectures and reinforced with the VPES practice cases.With the increasing emphasis on entrustment in clinical decision making [17, 18], it would be ideal if there were a mechanism by which learners could practice high-stakes skills in low-stakes settings to gain experience as they move towards entrustment. Results of this study indicate that for every four students trained, one misdiagnosis was prevented. Although we cannot extrapolate this finding to a clinical setting without substantial additional research,the collected data suggests that VPESs can provide health systems and institutions objective assessment of progress towards more accurate diagnoses, suggesting it could be used as a measurement tool to document when a student has achieved a higher level of entrustment.Many institutions are building and revising assessment  programs  for  learners  and  may  be  considering technology-enhanced simulations, specifically virtual pa-tient platforms, as formative components of an assessment system. The study demonstrated that detailed performance data can be provided to faculty and that in-program feedback received through simulation can create situations for students  to  understand,  self-correct  and  practice  the complex clinical skills required to improve diagnostic competence. Also, although not anticipated at the time of the study’s conception, recent challenges created by the COVID pandemic emphasize the need for more flexible,asynchronous, distant learning tools to augment the clinical arena [7]. Such a tool can function well in this environment.Although not the goal of the current study, future research  utilizing  technology-enhanced  simulation should be able to help educators more fully understand the different ways students approach diagnosing a patient, and may help us understand how to teach this better in addition to helping them develop a differential diagnosis strategy. This may be particularly helpful as we begin to shift from the traditionally taught History and Physical (H&P) to the H&P+360 where we begin into view the patient’s situation more in its entirety. Finally,the ability of technology-enhanced simulation platforms to store, compute, and analyze data can enhance our longitudinal analyses incorporating similar outcome variables and can study the trajectory of interventions to understand implications regarding the NNTandrelated clinical and systems level contributions for each learner.The results of this study should also be considered within the context of the study’s limitations. Several issues may have limited the apparent impact of the study. All Participating students were randomized to some type of intervention. (Ensuring every student had exposure to the diagnostic reasoning approach and platform). First, it is possible that the diagnostic approach outlined by the lectures had some generalizable effect that crossed over to the other symptom (a potentially useful outcome). This is supported by the improvement in the rate of correct diagnosis in the control group over their baseline performance(58 vs. 41%). This is the likely explanation for the lack of significant improvement when the intervention group was compared with the control group. Second, since some of the students were doing this while on rotation, they might have had additional exposure in the symptom to which they were not assigned. This possibility could not be controlled. Third, an additional limitation was that the intervention could be considered“low stakes”in that it was voluntary and did not count towards any curricular creditor score. Therefore, this might have resulted in less than maximal effort as was evidenced by the greater improvement in students with higher levels of engagement.Another limitation was that only 2 symptoms were studied. Additional research is needed to see if this translates across more symptoms and whether integrating this approach into a curricular program could achieve a greater level of competence. One curricular proposal would insert this simulated structured curriculum, addressing many common symptoms seen in internal medicine, family medicine and emergency medicine, between the preclinical and clinical years.The final and most important limitation of the study is the need to prove that this approach improves clinical practice. While few (perhaps no) other educational measures have met this bar, additional research would ideally test these interventions against real clinical outcomes such as process outcomes (i.e. testing appropriateness in real patients), and diagnostic accuracy.Conclusions This multi-institutional randomized control trial demonstrated  that  diagnostic  reasoning  could  be  improved through the use of a virtual patient simulation platform,paired with the S2D cognitive framework, as demonstrated by the improved completeness and efficiency of the stu-dents’differential diagnosis and accuracy of their final diagnosis in a VPES. It would be reasonable to hypothesize that this impact may be even more dramatic in situations such as the COVID pandemic which limit the students’clinical exposure and if this approach were incorporated in a meaningful and consequential way into their curriculum over a broader range of symptoms.Acknowledgments:The authors would like to thank Lisa Ksandr, project administrator at the American Medical Association, for her expert logistical assistance with coordinating study activities.

How does burnout affect physician productivity? A systematic literature review,"Carolyn S Dewa, Desmond Loong, Sarah Bonato, Nguyen Xuan Thanh and Philip Jacobs","Background: Interest in the well-being of physicians has increased because of their contributions to the healthcare system quality. There is growing recognition that physicians are exposed to workplace factors that increase the risk of work stress. Long-term exposure to high work stress can result in burnout. Reports from around the world suggest that about one-third to one-half of physicians experience burnout. Understanding the outcomes associated with burnout is critical to understanding its effects on the healthcare system. Productivity outcomes are among those that could have the most immediate effects on the healthcare system. This systematic literature review is one of the first to explore the evidence for the types of physician productivity outcomes associated with physician burnout. It answers the question,“How does burnout affect physician productivity?”Methods:A systematic search was performed of:Medline  Current,Medline  in  process,PsycInfo,Embase and Web  of Science. The search period covered 2002 to 2012. The searches identified articles about practicing physicians working in civilian settings. Articles that primarily looked only at residents or medical students were excluded.Productivity was captured by hours worked, patients seen, sick leave, leaving the profession, retirement, workload and presenteeism. Studies also were excluded if: (1) the study sample was not comprised of at least 50% physicians,(2) the study did not examine the relationship between burnout and productivity or (3) a validated measure of burnout was not used.Results:The search identified 870 unique citations; 5 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This review indicates that globally there is recognition of the potential impact of physician burnout on productivity. Productivity was examined using: number of sick leave days, work ability, intent to either continue practicing or change jobs. The Majority of the studies indicate there is a negative relationship between burnout and productivity. However, there is variation depending on the type of productivity outcome examined.Conclusions:There is evidence that burnout is associated with decreased productivity. However, this line of inquiry is still developing. A number of gaps are yet to be filled including understanding how to quantify the changes in productivity related to burnout. Keywords:Physician, Burnout, Productivity","Background There has been increasing interest in the well-being of physicians and their contributions to the quality of the healthcare system [1]. Part of this focus has been attributed to the recognition that physicians are exposed to workplace factors that increase the risk of work stress. Examples of these factors include long work hours [2], work overload [3], sleep deprivation and work conflicts [4]. In a meta-analysis, Alarcon [5] found that physician job demands, low job satisfaction and low organizational commitment are associated with emotional exhaustion among physicians. There is also recognition that long-term exposure to high work stress can result in burnout [6].Reports from around the world suggest that about one-third to one-half of physicians of various specialties experience at least one dimension of burnout (e.g., [7-11]). Burnout has been conceptualized as a syndrome consisting of three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low personal accomplishment [12]. Results of burnout include low job satisfaction [13,14], decreased mental health [15] and decreased quality of care [11].As the literature examining the prevalence of burnout among physicians has increased, there also has been growing interest in understanding the outcomes associated with burnout. Identifying the outcomes associated with burnout is critical to understanding the scope of the problem as it affects the healthcare system. For example,Williams et al. [16] found that higher levels of perceived stress affect physician intention to withdraw from practicing. Other studies have observed burnout to be related to early retirement [17]. The losses in patient services related to work cutback and early retirement have been estimated to be at least CAN $213 million [18].It has been asserted that there have been few studies examining the effectiveness of interventions designed to address burnout among physicians. A first step in filling this gap in the literature is to identify the types of outcomes that would be expected to change with the introduction of interventions. Of the types of outcomes that could be considered, productivity outcomes are among the outcomes that could have the most immediate effect on the healthcare system. This systematic literature review is one of the first to explore the evidence for the types of physician productivity outcomes associated with physician burnout. In it, we seek to answer the question,“How does burnout affect physician productivity?”In this review, we seek to identify how burnout affects the physician production of healthcare. This includes the ability to work, presence at work as well as workplace attachment.Methods This systematic review was based on published peer-reviewed articles that were publically available. Thus, it was not submitted to an ethics board for review. For the purposes of this systematic review, five databases were searched. They included: (1)Medline Current(contains journal citations and abstracts for biomedical literature in the fields of medicine, nursing, dentistry,veterinary medicine, the health care system, and the preclinical sciences), (2)Medline in process(contains journal citations and abstracts for biomedical literature that are in the process of being indexed in Medline Current),(3)PsycINFO(contains citations and summaries of journal articles, book chapters, books, technical reports, and dissertations, in the field of psychology and psychological aspects of related disciplines including medicine,psychiatry, nursing, sociology, education, pharmacology,physiology, linguistics, anthropology, sport, business, andlaw), (4)Embase(contains citations and abstracts of bio-medical, drug-related and clinical literature), and (5)Web Of Science(contains citations and abstracts from scholarlyjournals and conference proceedings in the sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities). The search period covered January 2002 to November 2012 and searches were limited to English language journals. The search was conducted between November 2012 and December 2012.Search strategy The search strategy was developed and executed with the assistance of a professional health science librarian.(See Additional file 1 for the complete search strategy used in each database.)Medline,Medline  in  Process,PsycINFO,and Embase were searched using the OVID platform; while Web  of  Science Was searched using the Thomson Reuters search interface. For the searches,burnout was defined as a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, cynicism (depersonalization) and reduced feelings of personal accomplishment related to work [12]. In addition, the searches focused on identifying articles about practicing physicians regardless of specialty who worked in civilian settings. As such, articles that primarily looked only at residents or medical students were excluded. However, search term limitations for residents and medical students were not used. This resulted in abroad search strategy to increase the likelihood that all studies on physician burnout would be found. Productivity was captured by hours worked, patients seen, sick leave, disability, quitting, leaving the profession, retirement, workload and presenteeism.Review articles and commentaries were excluded, and the reference lists of relevant studies were hand searched.Screening process Relevant articles were identified using a multi-phase screening process. To identify relevant articles, searchresults were screened first by title, then by abstract, andin the final screening process, by full-text review. Articles for which the title and abstract did not provide sufficient  information  to  determine  relevancy  were considered in the full-text review. The multi-phase screening process was completed independently by two reviewers, CSD and DL. Inclusion criteria were: (1) the study examined the relationship between burnout and work productivity, (2) the sample population was comprised of practicing physicians regardless of specialty who worked in civilian settings. Exclusion criteria were:(1) the study sample was not comprised of at least 50%physicians, (2) the study did not examine the relationship between burnout and productivity or (3) a validated measure of burnout was not used (i.e., there was no evidence that the psychometric properties of the measure had been evaluated). The inter-rater reliability correctedfor chance between CSD and DL wasқ= 0.69. Articles for which there was initial disagreement were discussed until consensus was reached.Quality assessment Articles that passed the three stage screening process moved on for quality assessment by the two reviewers(CSD and DL) using the following 10-item criteria adapted from Lagerveld et al. [19]:(1) Study population is well described (e.g., age, sex,location of the study, physician specialty, practice location)(2) Data collection methods are described(3) Participation/response rate (at baseline) was at least 50%(4) Burnout was assessed using a validated measure(5) Productivity outcome was clearly defined(6) Statistical method was appropriate for the question being answered(7) Statistical significance of associations were tested and reported(8) Study controlled for relevant confounding factors(9) Number of cases in the analysis was at least 10 times the number of independent variables(10) Research question was answered using longitudinal data (as opposed to cross-sectional data)One point was awarded for each criterion that was met for a maximum score of 10. Studies that achieved a score between 1 and 4 were regarded as fair quality.Studies with scores between 5 and 8 were regarded as good quality, and studies that scored 9 or 10 were regarded as excellent.Results Description of inclusion and exclusion The electronic literature search resulted in the identification of 870 unique citations (Figure 1). Of these, 102 entries that were commentaries were excluded. Based on the title review, 610 citations were dropped. After the abstract review, another 130 citations were excluded;this left 28 articles for full-text review. After the full-text review, 5 articles remained and their reference lists were hand searched for relevant studies. No articles were identified in the hand search process. Reasons for the full-text review exclusions were: (1) the study sample was not composed of at least 50% physicians (n = 2 articles), (2) did not examine the relationship between burnout and productivity (n = 21 articles) and (3) could not be obtained (n = 2 articles).The five studies were conducted in the US, China, HongKong, The Netherlands as well as in 12 European countries:Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Malta,Poland, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Quality assessment Based on the quality assessment, four of the five studies were categorized as good and one as excellent (Additional file 2, Additional file 3). The identified limitations were low response rates (<50%) (n = 3 studies), confounding factors not controlled for (n = 2 studies) and use of cross-sectional data (n = 5 studies).Overview of the study Burnout Table 1 includes a summary of the studies. In 4 of the 5 studies, burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-HSS (MBI) [12]. The MBI measures threedimensions of burnout. These are Emotional Exhaustion(EE), Depersonalization (DP) and Personal Accomplishment (PA). One study used a measure developed byPines et al. [20].The rates of burnout in the study samples varied.Ruitenburg et al. [21] observed a burnout rate of 6% in their sample of Dutch hospital physicians. In contrast,Soler and colleagues [22] observed that 43% of their sample of family doctors from 12 European countries had high EE, 35% had high DP and 39% had low PA. Siu et al. [14] observed that 31% of their Hong Kong sample of public hospital doctors experienced burnout. In their sample of US hospitalists, Hoff et al. [23] reported that 13% of respondents had burnout.Productivity measures The productivity outcomes that were reported in the articles included number of sick leave days, intent to continue practicing, intent to change jobs, and work ability(Table 2). All of the studies reported significant negative relationships between the three dimensions of burnout and the productivity measures used.Sick  leave There are conflicting results reported in the literature regarding the use of sick leave days. One study based on responses from family doctors from 12 European Countries found that all three burnout dimensions were significantly associated with more use of sick leave days[22]. Soler and colleagues [22] found that those who had at least one sick leave day during the year had significantly higher odds of reporting either high EE, DP or low PA.In contrast, Siu et al. [14] reported no statistically significant differences in the average sick leave days in the past year for public hospital physicians with and without high burnout scores.Intent  to  change  job Studies also reported that high burnout scores are significantly associated with intentions to leave a current position. For example, Soler et al.’s [22]12 European country study also found that those who affirmatively answered the question,“Have you seriously considered changing your job at least once over the past months?”had significantly greater odds of reporting either high EE, DP or low PA.In their study, Zhang and colleagues [24] also found a significant relationship between burnout and intention of looking for another job. Their survey of physicians practicing in one of three hospitals in Hubei province in China indicated there are significant correlations between high EE, DP and low PA and the intention of looking for another job.Intent to continue to practice medicine There is also indicates that burnout is significantly associated with intentions of quitting the current specialty. This could be problematic in systems in which there is a shortage of physicians or particular specialities. A survey of US hospitalists found that over 50% of respondents who were not at risk of burnout planned on continuing with hospital-based practice for more than 10 years [23]. In Contrast, a little more than a third of hospitalists who were at risk of burnout reported an intention of continuing with hospital-based practice for more than 10 years.Among those who met criteria for burnout, about 44%indicated they intended to continue to practice as a hospitalist for less than 4 years.Work ability A study from one academic medical center in the Netherlands found that hospital-based physicians who had high scores for both the EE and the DP dimensions of burnout had significantly greater odds of having self-perceived“insufficient”work ability [21]. Ruitenberg and colleagues [21] defined work ability as the“degree to which a worker is physically and mentally able to cope with the demands at work”(p. 2).Discussion This review indicates that countries all over the world are beginning to recognize the potential impact of physician burnout on productivity. In the studies that were identified, productivity was examined in four different ways that included number of sick leave days, intent to continue practicing, intent to change jobs, and workability. The results of the studies indicate that there is a negative relationship between burnout and productivity.However, there was at least one discrepancy depending on the type of productivity outcome of interest. For example, Soler et al. [22] found a significant relationship between burnout and sick leave while Siu et al. [14] did not. This may be because the type of productivity decrease chosen by physicians who experience burnout may be related to the context in which they practice.That is, one system may offer the option of taking sick leave while in another it may be more discouraged. This Suggests that rather than one measure of productivity, it is important to consider several depending on the context in which the study is being conducted. At the sametime, to help facilitate the translation of results to other systems, it may be important to consider a variety of productivity outcomes in the evaluation of physician burnout interventions.Research regarding the relationship between burnout and productivity loss seems to be in its infancy. There Are a number of questions that remain to be answered.For example, to what extent are the results generalizable to all physicians? Four of the reviewed studies focused on physicians primarily practicing in hospital-based settings. In addition, these studies did not report whether there were differences in productivity outcomes by specialty within the hospital setting. If there are differences in job characteristics by specialty that affect burnout, reduction in productivity may not be entirely attributable to burnout but to the type of specialty as well.Furthermore, two of the studies in this review included residents in their samples. This may have affected results. Because they are still in training, residents may have different experiences that may in turn affect the relationship between productivity and burnout. For example, if burnout is related to prolonged exposure to particular work factors, residents will have less exposure.Or, they may react differently from someone who has been practicing for a longer period of time.Another challenge of applying this literature is related to the differences in the healthcare systems. For example,are there characteristics of China’s state-run system that may not exist in non-state run settings? To improve the generalizability of future studies, it would be useful if they included more information about the healthcare system context in which the physicians practice.An additional limitation of the studies relates to the questions that ask about intent to either leave the current position or the specialty. These types of questions only gather information about intent rather than action. To the extent that intent develops into action, the measure is accurate. Otherwise, the measure could overestimate the number of people who actually follow through with their intentions.Although work ability is a promising measure of productivity, it is difficult to quantify the actual impact on productivity. Is it possible for someone who has a lowwork ability to be as productive as someone who has a high ability? The question remains to what extent does work ability correlated with productivity.All of the studies used cross-sectional data. Consequently, it is difficult to assign causality. For example,Soler et al. [22] examined the relationship between dimensions of burnout and the productivity outcomes by using the burnout dimensions as the dependent variables in regression analyses. This could also indicate that the experience of burnout is related to productivity rather than vice versa.Finally, there may be a publication bias. There may be studies which have not found significant relationships between burnout and productivity outcomes that may not have been published. If this is the case for a large number of studies, the bias could lead to an exaggeration of the relationship between burnout and productivity.It should also be noted that there may be limitations to our search. While five databases were searched, it is possible that an article could have been missed if it did not appear in any of the databases. However, that possibility is small given the broad scope of each of the data-bases. Another limitation is that the search does not include research that was not published in English.However, it should be noted that despite the language constraint, the included studies came from both Europe and Asia. This suggests that at least some of the researchers from countries in which English is not a first language are publishing in English language journals.Conclusions The findings of this systematic literature review indicate that there is interest throughout the world about the potential impact of physician burnout on productivity.There is evidence that burnout is associated with decreased productivity as it is captured in intent to leave a position or the field.However, this line of inquiry is still developing. There are a number of gaps that are yet to be filled. These include understanding whether there are differences by specialty, how the healthcare system impacts burnout and productivity, and how to quantify the changes in productivity related to burnout.",-,"1.

“Peri-Implantitis”: A Complication of a Foreign Body or a Man-Made “Disease”. Facts and Fiction,"Tomas Albrektsson, MD, PhD, RCPSG; Luigi Canullo, DDS; David Cochran, DDS, PhD; Hugo De Bruyn, DDS, PhD","ABSTRACT Background:The discrepancy  between  some  scientific  views  and  the  daily clinical  experience with  dental  implants  has made the topic of “periimplantitis” highly controversial, especially the discussion whether “peri implantitis” should even be  considered  a  “disease”  or  whether  marginal  bone  loss  instead  would  represent  a  complication  of  having  a  foreign body placed in the oral cavity.Purpose:The aim of the present paper was to present the outcomes from a consensus meeting on “peri-implantitis” in Rome, Italy (January 8–10, 2016).Materials and Methods:Seventeen clinical scientists were invited to, based on prepared reviews of the literature, discuss topics related to “peri implantitis.”Results and conclusions:  Oral  implants  may  lose  bone  or  even  display  clinical  failure.  However,  progressive  bone  loss threatening  implant survival  is rare  and limited to a  percent  or  two  of all  implants  followed up  over 10 years  or more,provided  that  controlled  implant  systems  are  being  used  by  properly  trained  clinicians.  There  is  very  little  evidence pointing  to  implants  suffering  from  a  defined  disease  entity  entitled  “peri-implantitis.”  Marginal  bone  loss  around implants  is  in  the  great  majority  of  cases  associated  with  immune-osteolytic  reactions.  Complicating  factors  include patient genetic disorders, patient smoking, cement or impression material remnants in the peri-implant sulcus, bacterial contamination  of  the  implant  components  and  technical  issues  such  as  loose  screws,  mobile  components  or  fractured materials. These reactions combine to result in cellular responses with the end result being a shift in the delicate balance between the osteoblast and the osteoclast resulting in bone resorption. However, the great majority of controlled implants display a foreign body equilibrium resulting in very high survival rates of the implants over long term of follow-up. KEYWORDS:clinical research, crestal bone loss, implant surface, inflammation, periimplantitis","INTRODUCTION: THE ROMA MEETING, JANUARY 8–10th, 2016With  the  publication  of  some  Scandinavian  papers 1–3 suggesting  that  oral  implants  suffered  a  lot  of  problems   with   marginal   bone   loss   (MBL)   and   peri-implantitis,  numerous  clinicians  were  most  surprised and  had  not  at  all  realized  nor  detected  the  magnitude  of  such  problems.  In  contrast,  most  clinicians were  convinced  that  oral  implants  fared  well  to  the benefit  of  their  patients,  with  only  minor crestal  bone loss   and   high   predictability   in   terms   of   functional success.   The   discrepancy   between   some   scientific views  and the  daily clinical  experience  made the  topic of   “peri-implantitis”   highly   controversial,   especially the  discussion  whether  “peri-implantitis”  should  even be  considered  a  “disease”  or  whether  MBL  instead would  represent  a  complication  of  having  a  foreign body placed in the oral cavity.The  topic  of  the  Roma  meeting  was  to  critically analyze  the  very  high  rates  of  implants  that  displayed problems  in  the  form  of  peri-implantitis  according  to the  Scandinavian  papers.1–3 Altogether  17  clinical  scientists,  the  majority of  those  being  periodontists,  were invited  to  discuss  to  what  extent  the  suggestions  of high  prevalence  of  numerous  problems  with  implants were  corresponding  to  clinical  reality or  were  exaggerated.  Prior  to  the  meeting,  a  number  of  manuscripts were  commissioned  to  review  the  literature  to  form  a basis  for  decisions.  These  papers  included  an  analysis of whether peri-implantitis is more common with certain  implant  surfaces,4how  commonly  the  conditionis  reported,5,6the  value  of  periodontal  indices  used  to describe  the  condition 4,7 and  whether  MBL  around oral   implants   may   occur   for  other   reasons   than   is commonly  reported.6 Furthermore,  when  disease  any-how  is  suspected  it  depends  on  immunological  phenomena;  implants  are  not  teeth.8,9 Different  implant surfaces  and  their  relation  to  MBL  was  additionally debated.   Furthermore,   the   numerous   definitions   of peri-implantitis 10 were   critically   analyzed,   since   noproper  consensus  exists  as  to  which  of  the  about  13 different  definitions  are  correct.  Surprisingly,  the  pres-ence  of  a  myriad  of  different  definitions  has  not  pre-ventedsomeclinicianstodrawverydefinitiveconclusions  about  the  magnitude  of  the  problem  of“peri-implantitis”   with   due   difficulties   to   generalizethese conclusions as common knowledge.The Suggested Notion of Very High Prevalenceof “Peri-Implantitis”In the original publications by Roos-Jansa ̊ker and col-leagues1and  Fransson  and  colleagues2it  was  claimedthat,   respectively,   6.6   and   12.4%   of   the   original,turned  Branemark-type  implants  suffered  from  progressive   bone   loss   after   the   first   year   in   function.However,  when  the  diagnosis  of  “peri-implantitis”  is based   on   a   more   liberal   approach   such   as   cross-sectional  evaluation  of  a  2  to  3  mm  bone-to-implant bone  level  instead  of  absolute  MBL,  the  number  of affected  implants  is  altered.  By  applying  even  more liberal  criteria  for  disease  such  as  a  positive  score  for bleeding  on  probing  (BoP),  probing  depth  (PD)  of4  mm  or  more  with  or  without  the  presence  of  pus on  probing,  then  18  to  43.3%  of  the  implants  in  theRoos-Jansa ̊ker and colleagues 1 study and 27.8% in the follow  up  study  of  Fransson  and  colleagues 10 suffered from   this   condition.   Even   higher   figures   of   “peri-implantitis”  were  reported  based  on  analyses  at  the patient instead of the implant level.The  old  papers 1,2reporting  very  high  values  of“peri-implantitis”   were   critically   appraised   at   theRoma   meeting.   The   meeting   discussion   benefited from   a   recently   published  paper   by  Jemt  and   colleagues 11 that  analyzed  what  happened  on  average  9.1years  later  with  the  implants  diagnosed  as  suffering from  progressive  bone  loss/”peri-implantitis”  after  5to  20  years  of  function  in  the  reports  by  Fransson And  colleagues 2,10The  bone  loss  was  indeed  not  progressive   at   all   for   more   than   90%   of   the   earlier included   “affected”   implants   that   had   only   quite insignificant  further  bone  loss  over  the  longer  follow up  time.11Jemt  and  colleagues 11 concluded  about  the Fransson  and  colleagues  papers2,10 that  “the  present study  group  lacks  scientific  stringency  to  be  used  for calculations   of   prevalence   of   peri-implantitis   in   a population.”  Indeed,  this  new  evidence  questions  the pathological  diagnostics  made  earlier.  This  discussion led to  a unanimously accepted statement at the  Roma meeting  “Well documented and proven implant systems when placed by properly trained and well educated clinicians have minor rates of implant loss and minor rates of bone loss over long term follow-up. Existing publications  on  prevalence  of  ‘Peri-implantitis’  are inflated by a number of factors that affect bone resorption (smoking, patients with a history of periodontal disease). Additionally, ‘peri-implantitis’ is often diagnosed wrongly in scientific papers by a lack of baseline radiographs or lack of ongoing bone loss measurements.Consequently, the acceptance rate for implant treatment, by both patients and clinicians may be affected unfortunately. Given the lack of a satisfactory diagnosis of ‘peri-implantitis,’ this may result in overtreatment of‘so-called disease.’ ”A   once   obtained   radiogram   taken   some   years after  the  baseline  radiograph  cannot  be  used  to  diagnose    “disease,”    nor    to    assess    progressing    MBL,because  this  requires  a  series  of  radiographs  from  different  times  of  follow-up  displaying  on-going  loss  of marginal  bone  (Figure  1).  The  latter  is  a  criterion  for peri-implantitis  diagnosis  as  clearly  stated  in  several consensus  reports.12–15 Without  such  a  demonstrated progression,  there  can  be  no  “disease,”  only  marginal bone adaptation that may be in a steady state without threatening  the  long  term  outcome  of  the  implant.This  suggestion  is  further  supported  by  the  review presented  at  the  Roma  meeting  by  DeBruyn  and  colleagues.4 This    demonstrates    that    the    long    term implant  survival  is  in  the  95  to  100%  range,  with only one study with  Titanium  Plasma Sprayed  surface implants reporting below 80% implant survival. Meantotal bone loss is by and large below 2 mm and is not affected  by  function  time  of  the  implants,  since  some studies  even  demonstrate  less  than  2  mm  bone  loss after   up   to   20   years   function.   These   are   highly improbable  figures  if  “peri-implantitis”  would  be  as problematic  as  postulated  in  the  pioneering  works.1–3 This  conclusion  is  further  validated  by  Jemt  and  colleagues 11 showing    that    95.3%    of    the    “allegedly affected”   implants   in   the   Fransson   and   colleagues study 2,10 were  still  surviving  9.1  years  later  and  not one  patient  had  lost  his/her  prosthetic  construction.A  more  recent  publication  by  Derks  and  colleagues 16 stated  that  “peri-implantitis”  is  a  major  and  growing problem based on the outcome of  a 9 years follow-up study.   In   45%   of   the   patients   and   24.9%   of   the implants  they  assessed  bone  loss  above  0.5  mm  in conjunction  with  BoP/suppuration.  What  the  authors referred  to  as  “moderate  to  severe  peri-implantitis”(BoP/suppuration  and  bone  loss>2  mm)  was  diagnosed  in  14.5%  of  the  subjects.  This  outcome  may,however,  be  biased  due  to  some  methodological  flaws and statistical errors in that there was a lack of standardization   of   the   time   for   the   baseline   radiographs which varied up  from  a  few  months up to  24  months after   surgery.   Furthermore,   in   one   fourth   of   the implants,  bone  loss  was  calculated  based  on  ortho-pantograms  which  significantly  increases  the  risk  for measurement   errors 17 and   in   44%   of   all   included implants the baseline radiograph was lacking. In those consistently   assessed   implants,   a   bone   level   of 2   mm   below   the   implant-prosthetic   interface   was arbitrarily  used  as  disease  threshold  as  suggested  previously.14 Given   those   drawbacks,   it   is   likely   that implants  with  steady  state  bone  levels  were  diagnosed as suffering from “disease.” Therefore,  these case definitions are lacking scientific evidence and may lead to unrealistically    high    prevalence    figures    for    “peri-implantitis”  as  well  as  potential  clinical  overtreatment of  implants  that  are  actually  in  a  steady  state  with respect to further bone loss.Furthermore,  the  pioneering  studies 1–3 used  not only  MBL  but  also  various  periodontal  indices  such as  BoP  and  PD  as  indicators  of  peri-implantitis.  This notion,  in  addition,  has  neither  survived  the  scrutiny of  time.  A  sensitivity  analysis  demonstrated  that  only between  19  and  43%  of  the  implants  showing  what was   termed   “progressive   bone   loss”   in   radiographs were   identified   by   either   pus   or   PD   of   6   mm   or more.4 Furthermore,  false  positives  were  between  27 and  44%  and  false  negatives  between  33  and  37%.  Inone  of  the  studies,1 it  was  demonstrated  that  there was   actually   more,   or   equal,   presence   of   pus/BoP around    implants    with    bone    gain    together    with implants   without   bone   loss,   than   around   implants with  bone  loss  which  taken  together  indicates  that one  may  critically  question  the  relevance  of  common periodontal  indices  when  diagnosing  “disease”  associated  with  dental  implants.4 In  another  critical  study of the diagnostic value of commonly used periodontal indices    in    the    diagnosis    of    dental    peri-implant“diseases,”   it   was   pointed   out   that   the   theoretical background  leading  to  the  applicability  of  these  tests was  based  only  on  a  few  animal  studies.  BoP  was found  as  commonly  around  implants  without  MBLas  it  was  found  around  implants  with  MBL6 indicative of BoP being a poor predictor for bone loss.Why Does Marginal Bone Loss Occur and How Should it be Evaluated?It is evident that long-term clinical outcomes with oral implants  are  highly  successful.4 Even  more  noteworthy however,   is   that   in   studies   that   report   that   an implant  has  “peri-implantitis,”  longer  term  follow up of  these  same  implants  demonstrate  that  most  continue   to   be   successful   many   years   later   in   the patient.11 MBL  during  the  first  year  after  implant  placement  is  regarded  as  bone  remodeling  due  to  surgical trauma  and  for  butt-joint  contaminated  interfaces,  asan  immunologic reaction  to  the bacteria and bacterial products  which  is  typically  limited  to  a  few   millimeters   away   from   the   interfaces.   Crestal   bone   loss around  an  implant  during  its  first  year  of  function may   spontaneously   heal  later.   However,   the   notion that    all    MBL    after    the    first    year    represents    a“disease”2; “peri-implantitis” is simply incorrect. Marginal  bone  resorption,  taking  place  after  the  first  year of  the  implant,  is  generally  a  result  of  complications to  treatment.  The  initial  bone  response  to  an  implant is  a  primary,  primitive  reaction  to  separate  the  non-self  from  the  tissues  and/or  a  reaction  to  a  localized infection,8but  thereafter  a  number  of  factors,  not  atall  associated  with  a  “disease,”  may  result  in  bone remodeling   and   MBL.   Complications   to   treatment resulting  in  such  loss  of  marginal  bone  can  be  associated  with  the  use  of  unsuitable  types  of  implants,broken  components,  loose  or  ill-fitting  components,excess  cement,  poor  clinical  handling  and  placement and/or   compromised   patients 18,19(Figure   2).   TheRoma  meeting  agreed  that  “Bone loss may be a result of  many different complications  caused  by  implant treatment itself such as using certain implants, clinician error, patient conditions, treatment protocol and quality of treatment.”Cement  remnants  in  the  soft  tissues  is an  example  of  problems  associated  with  the  clinical handling.   Cement   remnants   can   lead   to   marginal bone  resorption  and  infection  due  to  a  foreign  body reaction that may be also coupled to the leakage of titanium  inevitable  around  oral  implants 20–23(Figure  3).However, removing the cement in many cases easily solves  the  problem  and  further  bone  resorption  does  not occur, at least if the cement is removed prior  to causing severe tissue destruction.As  discussed  by  Coli  and  colleagues 7“....  dental implants  and rehabilitations  that  have been well functioning   for   several   years   are   suddenly   assigned   to non-surgical   or   surgical   treatments   up   to   possibly even  implant  removal  due  to  the  detections  of  a  specific PD and/or presence of BoP.” A demonstrated PDof  more  than  4  mm  in  combination  with  BoP  and  a defined   level   of   MBL   was   incriminated   as   “peri-implantitis”1in  one  study,  despite  lack  of  scientific evidence  for  implants  (and  as  opposed  to  teeth)  that such  findings  of  PD  or  BoP  around  implants  is  predictive of ongoing bone loss or future implant failure. In  fact,  PD  levels  of  up  to  9  mm  around  implants may  coincide  with  clinical  success.24 Studies  claiming to   present   evidence   for   the   use   of   PD   around implants   are   few   and   exclusively   based   on   animal models   including   quite   irrelevant   ligature   studies.6Coli  and  colleagues 7,  therefore,  concluded  that  “PD assessment   around   implants   appears   to   be   a   poor diagnostic  tool.”  The  finding  of  BoP around  implants may  be  associated  with  peri-implant  “disease”  as  well as  being  associated  with  healthy  conditions.2 Similar findings   were   reported   in   another   early   study   on“peri-implantitis,”where it was observed that implants with stable bone levels without “disease” still had  BoP  in  42.2%  of  the  implants.1 Coli  and  colleagues 7 reviewed   the   existing   literature   and   concluded  that  defining  “peri-implantitis”  based  on  loss of marginal bone combined with BoP is inappropriate since  up  to  90%  of  implants  with  stable  bone  conditions   bleed   on   probing.   At   the   Roma   meeting,   all agreed  that  “BoP is a poor predictor for progressive bone loss in general.”Attempts to Define “Peri-Implantitis”Everyone   at   the   Roma   meeting   agreed   that   “peri-implantitis”   is   not   a   clearly   defined   condition.   It seems  like  many  clinicians  have  tried  to  define  such“disease”  based  on  a  combination  of  MBL  and  findings  of  BoP  and  PD  of  more  than  6  mm.  The  problem  is  the  lack  of  consensus  and  the  reality  that  such findings   may   indeed   reflect   a   normal   steady   state,depending  on  a  provoked  foreign  body  response  in the  host  and  not  a  true  pathological  condition.  Rosenand  colleagues 9 found  eight  different  definitions  suggested  in  the  literature  and  some  more  definitions have  been  introduced  since  the  publication  of  that paper.  The result  of  an inadequate definition and lack of  consensus  or  even  diagnosis,  may  explain  the  large variability  in  the  prevalence  of  implants  that  are  purported  to  suffer  from  “disease.”  Attempts  to  describe“peri-implantitis”  as  an  identical  disease  as  periodontitis  have not  been supported  by scientific studies.25,26 The  results  of  this  lack  of  agreement  and  individual definitions  of  so  called  “disease”  have  been  the  publication  of  a  great  number  of  scientific  papers  claiming unrealistically  and  false  high  frequencies  of  implant“disease.”  Not  even  finding  bacteria  in  the  implant interface,   would   necessarily   qualify   for   a   “disease.”Bacteria  present  may  result  in  a  localized  infection near  the  interface  and/or  be  evidence  only  of  a  secondary opportunistic reaction 19; it may represent bacteria   promoting   a   nonspecific   local   infection   that exists  without  necessarily  causing  a  unique  and  specific  “disease”  around  the  implant.  Our  science  has not   progressed   significantly   from   endless   bacterial counts,  even  if  gram  negative  anaerobes  have  been found  in  the  implant  interface.  Furthermore,  there  is insufficient evidence that so called mucositis necessarily will lead to “peri-implantitis.”The  old  way  of  diagnosing  “peri-implantitis”  by arbitrarily  selecting  a  certain  accumulated  MBL  of,commonly,  2  or  3  mm  paired  with  BoP  and  PD  of more  than  4  mm  has  not  survived  the  scrutiny  of time.   This   is   quite   logical,   since   it   is   difficult   to explain   why   losing   for   example,   1.5   mm   of   bone around  an implant would  be regarded as healthy conditions,  whereas  finding  another  half  a  millimeter  of MBL  would   be  incriminated  as   “disease”  especially given   a   large   biologic   variability   in   humans.   Too often,  clinicians  misinterpret  mean  data  and  ignore reported   standard   deviations   of   the   data.   In   this situation,  it  would  be  very  logical  trying  to  limit  thecategory of  sick  implants  by  selecting those that  reallydemonstrateongoingMBLthattrulythreatensimplant  survival  and  term  those  to  be  suffering  from“disease,”  even  if  this  “disease,”  in  reality,  is  but  a complication   to   a   foreign   body   resulting   in   an immune-osseous   reaction   resulting   in   bone   loss.9 Lamentably,  the  periodontal  associations  have  chosen the  opposite  route;  they  have  widened  the  criteria  for diagnosing  “disease.”  The  7th  European  workshop  on periodontology suggested that“peri-implantitis”should  indicate  change  in  the  level  of  crestal  bone,BoP  and  deepening  of  peri-implant  pockets  and  or suppuration.13 This  is  not  very   far  away   from  the suggested    American,    AAP    definition    that    “peri-implantitis”   is   an   inflammatory   reaction   associated with  the  loss  of  supporting  bone  around  an  implant.9The  problem  with  both  these  definitions  is  that  they include   almost   every   implant,   since   inflammation,even  if  in  a  mild  form,  is  characterizing  the  so  called foreign   body   equilibrium 27 and   slow   resorption   of marginal bone may accompany patient ageing.6One  may  certainly  claim  that  the  foreign  body equilibrium  characterizing  the  successful  implant27isin  constant  threat  due  to  patient  and  environmental factors.  However,  the  reality  is  quite  excellent  result-ing   in   outstanding   long-term   clinical   results   with dental  implants.  New  research  recognizing  this  fact seems  fundamental  instead  of  incriminating  numerous implants with a suggested “disease.”How Do You Determine How Common Is“Peri-Implantitis”?The  frequency  of  “peri-implantitis”  certainly  depends on   how   the   condition   is   defined.   Does   it   include implants  with  cement  in  the  tissues?  Does  it  include implants  with  loose  or  broken  components?  Does  it include  implants  with  bone  augmentation  procedures that   fail   in   forming   or   maintaining   bone?   Does   it include  implants  placed  with  dull  instruments  that overheat  the  bone?  Does  it  include  implants  that  are misplaced   and   have   insufficient   bone   around   the implant?   It   was   agreed   at   the   Roma   meeting   that“focusing on interpreting the existing literature will not bring us any further due to in-homogenous data, differ-ent  definitions  of  disease  and  other  factors  being included in the study. We need to do things differently and re-define ‘peri-implantitis’ and develop guidelines or future studies based on this definition. Those guidelines should be presented to the community.”It is noteworthy  that the  previous Estepona  consensus 28 on  MBL  and  “peri-implantitis”  as  well  as  a  recentreview4came  to  the  conclusion  that  only  some  2.7%  of modern implants display problems with“peri-implantitis,”  even  If  traditional  diagnostics  based  on  the pioneering  studies 1,2was  applied.25 However,  today  we need  new  definitions  since  the  old  ones  have  not  passed the  scrutiny  of  time.  If,  for  example,  those  implants  in the  Estepona  consensus 28 that  had  successfully  removed cement   remnants   as   reason   for   MBL   are   considered irrelevant for“disease,”the frequency of“peri-implantitis”  was  lower  than  2%.  If  only  the  situation  at 10  years  or  more  of  follow  up  was  analyzed  separately,then   0.88%   of   the   analyzed   1,826   implants   demonstrated  “disease.”  Thus,  the  exclusion  of  complications in  the  use  of  foreign  bodies  to  replace  teeth  leads  to exceedingly  low  rates  of  implants  experiencing  problems and may be realistically less than 1%  of all implants.Do Some Implant Surfaces Display Greater Incidence of Implant Problems than Others When  scrutinizing  the  literature 4,29 there  is  clear  evidence  that  modern,  moderately  rough  surfaces  present  with  higher  implant  survival  rates  than  minimally rough   or   rough   implant   surfaces.   The  comparative analysis  of  incidence  of  “peri-implantitis”  with  different  types  of  surfaces  is  very  problematic,  since  “peri-implantitis”   is   defined   in   so   many   different   ways without  agreement  what  is  and  what  is  not  “disease.”De  Bruyn  and  colleagues 4 performed  a  comparative study  of  bone  loss  rates  around  different  surfaces  as surrogate for “peri-implantitis.” It was concluded that whereas  minimally  rough  surfaces  displayed  an  average  MBL  at  5  years  or  more  of  0.86  mm,  moderately rough  surfaces  displayed  1.01  mm  and  rough  surfaces 1.04 mm of  average MBL. However, the multifactorial cause  for  bone  loss  and  the  heterogeneity  of  the  analyzed  studies  made  it  very difficult  to  draw  unequivocally    strong    conclusions    regarding    the    effect    of implant  surface  roughness  on  bone  loss  over  time.4 Furthermore,  one  modern  implant  design  does  have slightly  more bone loss than others at 5 years,29a fact that  influences  the  summed  bone  loss  of  moderately rough surfaces.However,this particular design yielded  this  somewhat  greater  bone  loss  only  during the  first  year  after  which  there  was  a  steady  state; ence  it  is  a  good  implant  system  with  excellent  10 year  clinical  results,28 despite  skewing  the  bone  loss statistics  somewhat  at  5  years  of  follow  up.  Having Said   this,   some   colleagues   have   interpreted   “peri-implantitis”  animal studies which  depend  on ligatures to  both  induce  trauma  and  infection 30,31 to  point  in the  direction  of  incriminating  modern  implants  with increased  levels  of  MBL.  However,  ligatures  by  their nature  are  miles  away  from  the  clinical  reality  and merely  represent  a  foreign  body  on  another  foreign body  that  sets  off  a  cascade  of  immunologically  based events  involving  trauma,  infection  and  bone  resorption  around  experimental  implants.  The  outcome  of such animal studies is, therefore, best taken with great caution  and  a  large  grain  of  salt  and  proper comparisons to clinical cases are most likely, not possible.Implants as Foreign Bodies and its Implications For Marginal Bone Loss Today,  it  is  becoming  increasingly  evident  that  oral implants  are  but  foreign  bodies.6,8,27,32,33 Therefore,immunological problems associated with bone metabolism,  similar  to  all  bones,  are  part  of  the  reasons why   dental   implants   may   be   threatened   and   lost.Commonly  known  bone  cells  such  as  the  bone  building   osteoblast   and   the   bone   eating   osteoclast   will finally  determine  what  will  happen  with  our  implant.These  cells  work  in  a  coupled  manner;  that  is,  they work  only  in  the  presence  of  one  another  and  in  bal-ance/equilibrium.Furthermore,whenosteoblastsdominate,  bone  formation  occurs,  but  when  osteoclasts    dominate    bone    loss    occurs    and    problems around  implants  may  follow.  Furthermore,  the  osteoblast  and  the  osteoclast  represent  bone  cells  as  well  as immunological  cells.34,35 It  seems  plausible  that  when all  is  fine,  osseointegration  works  splendidly,  but  in case  of  problems  the  result  may  be  bone  resorption.If the sum of the problems is minor and compensated for,  no  further  problems  may  be  detected,  however,  if the  sum  of  the  problems  is  major,  implant  failure may occur.19 Examples of problems that may combine with    the    immunological    reactions    are    improper implant  systems,  poor  clinical  handling,  patient  dis-ease,  patient  smoking,  or  suffering  from  genetic  disorders  or  patients  having  previous  periodontitis  or  adverse effects  of  pharmaceutical  products  (the  latter  category needing much more research in the future).18,19 Indeed, the vast majority of implants with significant  bone  loss  or  truly  progressive  bone  loss,  can  be associated  with  some  identifiable  complicating  factors such  as  peri-implant  cement,  bacterial  contamination of  the  components,  loose  screws  and  mobile  components,   or   fractured   materials.   In   addition,   to   date,there  is  no  evidence  in  the  literature  that  a  specific peri-implant “disease” exists as a unique entity with specific   etiology   and   pathogenesis.   One   may   even speculate  that  what  truly  happens  with  an  implant displaying  ongoing  MBL  is  related  to  immunological rejection  mechanisms  that  have  been  activated  by  the above   mentioned   identifiable   complicating   factors that  result  in  cellular  reactions  with  the  end  result being   a   shift   in   the   delicate   balance   between   the osteoblast and the  osteoclast resulting  in  bone  resorption  (Figure  4).  In  a  recent  review  paper,36 it  was concluded  that  metal  particles  and  metal  ions  may induce  immune  responses  that  lead  to  osteolysis  and implant  failure.  Titanium  ions  are  considered  prone to   bind   and   induce   damage   to   molecules   such   as RNA  and  DNA.  Particulate  and  ionic  Ti  debris  were reported to influence the immune system.36  Clinical Implications It  is  clear  from  the  discussion  above  that  there  are many  reasons  why  one  might  encounter  MBL  around dental implants and that in many cases, this bone loss can be attributed to complications associated with the implant  and  its  components  such  as  loose  abutment screws,  broken  components,  bacterial  contamination of  interfaces,  cement  in  the  soft  tissues,  and  so  forth.Furthermore, it is evident from the literature that traditional periodontal measures, indicative  of  periodontal  disease  around  teeth,  are  not  valid  indicators,  no predictors,   of   peri-implant   ongoing   bone   loss.   As these  data  emerge,  the  clinician  encountering  patients with  dental  implants  is  faced  with  a  diagnostic  challenge.  Clearly,  however,  if  the  patient  presents  with symptoms  associated  with  an  implant,  a  periapical radiograph  is  indicated  and  an  investigation  of  the implant   and   its   restorative   components   warranted.Furthermore,  if  suppuration  is  evident,  or  present  on probing,  meticulous  clinical  and  radiographic  inspection  of  implant  and  components  is  required  to  determine the cause of the infection.A  more  difficult  diagnostic  situation  is  encountered  when  there  is  an  absence  of  patient  symptoms and  there  is  BoP  around  the  implant  (acknowledging that  probing  while  not  predictive  of  future  problems nor particularly indicative of current problems, nevertheless,  allows  the  clinician  the  ability  to  investigate the   peri-implant   condition   of   the   tissue).   In   these cases,  determining  the  amount  of  bleeding  and  the degree  of  swelling  and  inflammation  could  be  useful.If   only   mild   bleeding   is   present   with   no   patient symptomatology,  cleaning  of  the  implant  and  component   surfaces   may   suffice   to   return   the   tissues   to health.  If  however,  there  is  more  moderate  to  severe bleeding  and  inflammation  in  the  absence  of  patient symptoms,    more    thorough    diagnostics    might    be employed  as  well  as  more  aggressive  treatment  and follow   up.   Until   a   better   understanding   of   dental implants  with  pathologic  tissue  changes  is  achieved,the  clinician  should  be  diligent  and  frequently  monitor such implants and restorations.Concluding Remarks Crying  wolf  too  loud  and  for  too  long  may  prove hazardous when the  real wolf appears. After all,  problems   with   implants   may   occur   and   the   profession must   be   alerted   to   react   adequately   to   those   real problems.  Therefore,  we  believe  that  our  profession has not been helped at all from the current over diagnosing  of  an  alleged  disease;  “peri-implantitis,”  not the  least  since  it  may  harm  our  patients  and  motivate some  bold  clinicians  to  treat  conditions  that  are  best left   untreated.   Having   said   this,   even   with   good implants  placed  by  trained  individuals  we  may  see some  implant  problems  with  MBL,  even  if  limited  to less  than  1–2%  of  implants  at  10  years  of  follow  up.The  profession  must  work  hard  to  identify  truly  at-risk   patients   and   suggest   adequate   care   for   them,instead  of  quoting  clearly  inflated  figures  about  allegedly problematic implants that, in fact, are in a steady state situation.CONCLUSIONS 1.  “Peri implantitis ”is not a clearly defined condition2.  There  is  no  evidence  in  the  literature  that  a  specific  peri-implant  disease  exists  as  a  unique  entity with a specific etiology  and pathogenesis 3.  Progressive MBL after the first year of the implant commonly  depends  on  a  complication  to  treat-ment that is unrelated to “disease”4.  A  once  obtained  radiograph  after  baseline  radiography  is insufficient to diagnose “disease”5.  To  diagnose  peri-implant  health,  we  need  a  series of  radiographs  from  different  times  of  follow  up to  decide  whether  a  particular  implant  has  progressive loss of marginal bone or not6.  Periodontal  indices  such  as  BoP  and  PD  are  not reliable   diagnostic   tools   for   identifying   “peri-implantitis”7.  There  is  no  clinical  evidence  published  that  mod-ern,  moderately  rough  implants  will  display  more“peri-implantitis”   than   older   turned   or   plasma sprayed implants 8.  Peri-implant  inflammation  is  not  necessary  equalto progressive “disease,”9.  Progressive MBL may be caused by numerous factors   related   to   the   implant,   the   clinician,   the patient,  the  treatment  protocol,  prosthetic  overload, quality of care, and maintenance 10.  It  seems  like  what  we  see  in  cases  with  truly  progressive  MBL  is  related  to  a  complicating  factor resulting in immuno-osteolytic reaction accounting for the ongoing bone resorption.

Accuracy  of  haptic  robotic  guidance  of  dental  implant  surgery for  completely  edentulous  arches,"Scotty L. Bolding, DDS, MS, FACS and Uday N. Reebye, MD, DMD","ABSTRACT Statement of problem.The accuracy of single implant placement is critical, as errors may cause problems with vital structures intraoperatively, as well as postoperatively with the prostheses.These issues may be exacerbated in complete-arch edentulous treatments requiring relative accuracy among multiple implants, particularly with prefabricated prosthetic structures.Purpose.The purpose of this clinical study was to determine the accuracy of dental implant placement by using haptic robotic guidance in completely edentulous participants.Material and methods.In a prospective single-arm clinical study, 5 qualified participants elected to receive dental implants placed by using haptic robotic guidance to restore either the maxillary or mandibular arch, or both, with complete-arch implant-supported prostheses. Three dual-arch participants and 2 single-arch participants resulted in 38 endosteal dental implants being placed.A virtual preoperative restorative and surgical plan was created before surgery. This plan was matched to the surgical workspace on the day of surgery by using a bone-mounted fiducial splint fabricated from a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan. Intraoperatively, the surgeons maneuvered a handpiece attached to the robotic guidance arm, osteotomies were created with a haptically constrained handpiece, and the implants were placed with 3-dimensional haptic constraints as per the virtual plan. Postoperative CBCT scans allowed the evaluation of the deviations of the actual implant placement relative to the plan.Results.Twenty-three implants were placed in the mandible and 15 in the maxilla. The mean±standard deviation global angular deviation was 2.56 ±1.48 degrees, while the crown of the placed implant showed a deviation from the plan of 1.04 ±0.70 mm and the apex of 0.95 ±0.73mm. The signed depth deviation was 0.42 ±0.46 mm proud. No adverse events were reported.Conclusions.This clinical series for treating completely edentulous patients by using haptic robotic guidance was found to be safe and accurate. While further longer-term clinical studies are necessary to measure outcomes and to assess differences as compared with non robotic implementations,haptic robotic preparation appears to confer additional intraoperative advantages over other techniques for treating completely edentulous arches. (J Prosthet Dent 2021;-:---)","Three-dimensional  (3D)  imaging with the use of cone beam computed tomography(CBCT) scanning and 3D image manipulation and planning software programs have become  popular.1 Utilizing these technologies has allowed the dental and surgical teams to  plan  complex  surgeries virtually  and  has  enabled guided tools to assist with the surgical placement of endosteal  dental  implants.  Three types of guided implant surgeries have emerged from 3d Imaging and planning technology: physical static guides,camera-based navigation, and most recently robotic guidance.The use of CBCT scans has allowed computer-aided design  and  computer-aided manufacturing(CAD-CAM) technology to produce static physical guides to assist with endosteal dental implant placement. Early staticguides were generally made of acrylic resin and used as a partially guided system, with the guide constraining the drill position but the implants being placed freehand.With advances in computer technology, 3D-printed guides used a series of sleeves matched to guided drill systems. These guided systems improved placement accuracy compared with either freehand or partially guided methods, as the dental implant was placed through the guide.2 The potential sources of error of static physical guides include the accuracy of the original scan, the methods used to 3D print and manufacture the guide,the fit of the guide in the mouth, and the necessary requirement of clearance between the drill bit and guide holes.3 Nonetheless,  such  guides  typically  produce implant positioning errors for individual implants of a millimeter or less and an angulation error of a few degrees, whereas freehand errors can routinely be twice that or more.4 Static guides can be affixed and registered to the patient anatomy during surgery in 3 ways: to the bone (which requires lifting aflap and has been reported to be the least accurate way 5,6), to the teeth, or to the mucosa. The drawbacks of static guides include that their production, whether in-house or by outside laboratories,can delay surgery. Guides can also shift or fracture in use,do not permit intraoperative adjustments, and may impede irrigation. Many protocols also require a second scan of the prosthesis itself. Only mucosa- and tooth-supported guides permit minimally invasive flapless surgery. Static guides require longer drills and thus maybe difficult to use in posterior locations where access is restricted or in narrow spaces between teeth.7-9 Finally,static guides impede the surgeon’s view of the actual surgical site during osteotomy preparation and implant placement, as the guide system covers the surgical site.Camera-based navigation is a subset of dynamic navigation, also known as computer-aided guidance intraoperative navigation and provides real-time visual information via a visual display of the position of the drillor implant on a monitor with respect to the surgical plan from the computed tomography image. Dynamic navigation has been reported to be as accurate as fully guided static surgeries.7,8In addition, by avoiding fixed physical(static) guides that must be manufactured, dynamic systems may facilitate same-day treatment, avoid the risks of fractured or inaccurate guides, allow for irrigation at the surgical site, and enable the surgeon to respond to intraoperative  conditions  by  changing  the  plan  as needed.  Camera  navigation  systems,  however,  lack physical guidance during execution, as they do not actively prevent surgeons from deviating from the plan or preparing beyond the plan; they do identify deviations from the plan as they occur and provide visual cues to return to the plan. However, the surgeon is required to look away from the patient to receive such visual cues,which can reduce tactile feedback or other cues from the surgical site itself. In addition, because camera navigation systems typically use infrared or visible light to track the drill relative to the patient, they require each aspect to remain within the line of sight of the stereoscopic camera to avoid communication errors during the procedure.9 Electromagnetic-based systems work similarly in that they track the instruments relative to the patient but without potential line of site issues; however, they can be sensitive to distortions from ferrous metal objects such as the drill head.10 Robot-assisted dental surgery, in contrast, combines the advantages of both the physical constraints of static guides and the flexibility of image-based dynamic navigation. The first commercially available robotic system for dental implant surgery provides physical (haptic) as well as visual and auditory guidance to the surgeon during dental implant surgery (Fig. 1). A software program uses a CBCT scan of the patient and allows the 3D planning of ideal positioning of the implants based on bone availability, biomechanical load characteristics for the chosen prosthesis design, and visualization of the 3D interaction of the implant with critical anatomic structures. The system is compatible with a variety of implant systems,which enables ideal size and shape optimization for a patient-specific plan. This is similar to the preoperative methods used to plan implant placements with both static guides and camera-based navigation. However,once the implant plan is optimally positioned, the robotic assistance provides 3D physical guidance of the dental surgical instruments during the execution of the digital plan in terms of the desired location, angulation, anddepth. If the tool is in the correct location and orientation, there is no physical resistance provided by the robot.However, if the tool deviates in any way, the robot constrains the tool axis to the planned location and orientation. The planned depth is planned similarly. If the instrument is in the correct location and orientation and not to the planned depth, no resistance is added by the robot. The surgeon feels the normal sensation of drilling or implanting. As the instrument reaches the planned depth, the robotic arm stops the tool and does not allow further drilling. The surgeon retains the ability to modify the implant position plan at any time during the surgical procedure. During the haptic guidance of the osteotomy, full visualization of and access to the surgical site  for  instrumentation  and  irrigation  is  provided.Moreover, the fully digital workflow not only eliminates the potential for inaccuracies during the production and fitting of a physical guide but also allows for patients to be treated with same-day guided surgery treatment.All 3 of these methods for guiding the insertion of dental implants are designed to reduce the human error in freehand treatments, but each has potential sources of related error causing deviations between the 3D plan and the actual implant placement. Deviations in the placement of a single implant relative to a preoperative plan may cause problems intraoperatively such as un-expected proximity to vital nerve and vessel structures.11 Issues can occur postoperatively as well in terms of the prosthesis and patient discomfort.12 In particular, deviations of implant placement can be problematic as they may cause unexpected distribution of loads during mastication, potentially causing fatigue failure of the components.13 These issues may be exacerbated incomplete-arch edentulous treatments requiring relative accuracy among multiple implants, particularly with prefabricated prosthetic structures. These issues can be mitigated by placing the burden on the restorative steps of the prosthetic workflow after implant placement.However, if the prosthetic framework is fabricated before implantation of the implants based on the same 3D virtual planning, inaccuracies can lead to mis-alignments requiring occlusal adjustments and potential bone  margin  overload.11 The  accuracy  of  implant placement using static guides and dynamic navigation has been studied.7,9,14-30 The purpose of this clinical study was to evaluate the 3D accuracy of implant placement in complete-arch edentulous treatments by using haptic robotic guidance.MATERIAL AND METHODS This protocol was approved and administered under Western Institutional Review Board Protocol #20193123as part of a Food and Drug Administration-approved Investigational Device Exemption submission G190282.In a prospective single-arm clinical study, 5 qualified adult participants (3 men, 2 women; average age=57 years, range 47 to 65) elected to receive dental implants to restore either the maxillary or mandibular arch, orboth, with complete-arch implant-supported prostheses and were treated by using haptic robotic guidance. The 3 dual-arch participants and 2 single-arch participants resulted in 38 individual implant placements. A virtual preoperative restorative and surgical plan was created(Neocis Inc) before surgery (Fig. 2).On the day of surgery, a single-use, disposable edentulous splint was affixed to the anterior maxilla or mandible with self-tapping bone screws (2.0 or 2.3 mm diameter, Stryker) (Fig. 3). Splint affixation was performed under local anesthesia (Marcaine [bupivacaine ];Pfizer), while the implant procedure proceeded under general anesthesia (Diprivan [propofol], Fresenius Kabi).A CBCT scan with a splint-mounted fiducial array was merged with the previously created virtual plan. The fiducial array was then removed from the splint and replaced with a patient tracker robotic end effector,allowing the surgical robot (Yomi, Neocis Inc) to track the patient’s motion. Intraoperatively, the surgeons (SLB,UNR) maneuvered Yomi handpiece attached to the robotic guidance arm. This guidance arm haptically con-strained the handpiece in 3D space as defined by the virtual plan while the surgeon performed the osteotomies and placed the implants.Participants then received a postoperative CBCT scan and  examination.  The  methodology  for  measuring implant accuracy used a standardized 3D voxel-based registration of superimposed images of the implant plan with the postoperative CBCT (Fig. 4).14,31,32 This registration process consists of the isosurface matching of localized regions. The difference between the planned and actual location of each implant was measured and reported as per the International Team for Implantology(ITI) consensus report suggesting deviations should be standardized to allow fair comparisons across studies.Accuracy data are thus reported in terms of global angular deviation in degrees (a), which is the 3D angle between the central axis of the planned and the place implants and the signed depth deviation in mm (sd),which is the difference in the coronal depth of the planned and the placed implants along the long axis of the planned implant, with negative indicating the actual placement is deeper than on the plan. In addition, the global coronal deviation (c) and global apical deviation(a), both in mm, are reported. These 2 metrics represent the 3D distances between the coronal and apical center of the planned and actual implant positions (Fig. 5). Allmetrics were assessed by using standard descriptivestatistics   (mean,   standard   deviation,   minimum,maximum, and 95% confidence intervals).RESULTS A total of 38 implants were placed in 8 arches in 5 par-ticipants (Table 1). Twenty-three implants were placed in the mandible and 15 in the maxilla, including 3 dual-arch treatments. Seven of the 8 arches (in 4 of the 5 participants) required tooth extractions during surgery. Bonequality ranged from Type 1 to Type 3 as classified by Lekholm and Zarb.33One arch was treated by using aflapless approach, while conservative tissue flaps were performed for all other participants. Three arches in 2 participants were successfully provided with immediately loaded complete-arch prostheses. No adverse events were reported. No nerve canal perforations or apical bone penetrations were seen in the postoperative CBCT images.Accuracy was assessed by the signed depth deviation,the global angular deviation, and the 3D coronal and apical deviations (Table 2). The mean ±standard deviation signed depth deviation was 0.42 ±0.46 mm proud,with no instances of the crown of the actual implant deeper than on the plan. The global angular deviation averaged 2.56 ±1.48 degrees with 95% confidence limits of 2.10 degrees and 3.03 degrees. The crown of the actual placed implant showed an average deviation from the plan of 1.04 ±0.70 mm and the apex a deviation of 0.95±0.73 mm. Implants in the mandible showed significantly higher depth deviations (0.55 ±0.53 mm versus 0.23 ±0.25 mm;P=.04) and angular deviations (3.09±1.38  degrees  versus  1.76  ±1.27  degrees;P=.005)compared with implants in the maxilla.DISCUSSION The authors are unaware of a previous study that use haptic robotic guidance to treat completely edentulous patients. The analysis of the results indicated accurate placement of the implants compared with the plan. Accuracy is critical in implant placement and arguably even more so in completely edentulous patients. Deviations between the plan and the actual implant positions have been associated with prosthetic complications, including misfit of the restoration and the need for occlusal adjustments.12 Implant accuracy has been evaluated by comparing the planned versus the actual implant placement by using both static guides and dynamic computer navigation. A systematic review of the accuracy of mucosa-supported  static  surgical  guides  in  the completely  edentulous  patient  showed  mean  apical global deviations ranging from 0.67 mm to 2.19 mm,mean coronal global deviations ranging from 0.6mm to 1.68mm, and mean angular deviations ranging from 2.6degrees to 4.67 degrees.15 Figure 6 shows the results of the present study compared with those of numerous other clinical accuracy studies on completely edentulous participants with static guides and dynamic navigation.7,9,14,16-27 The plot of the mean deviations in this present study (2.56 degrees angular; 1.04 mm global coronal; 0.95 mm global apical) shows that robotic guidance of implant placement was at least as accurate as both  static  and  dynamic  navigation  (Fig.  6).  The Maximum deviations in this study showed 1 implant with an angular deviation of 5.20 degrees and another implant with a translational deviation of 4.25 mm. The deviations in these situation resulted from poor bone quality requiring adjustments at the time of implant placement to allow the implant to be placed in the most stable body environment available. Poor bone quality does not affect the accuracy of robotic bone preparation but may affect the final implant location compared with the plan. Clinicians must recognize deviations from the plan and be assured  that  the  implants  are  not  placed  in  vital structures such as the sinus, nerves, or adjacent tooth roots. In addition, the robotic system used a conventional implant handpiece and standard burs. There may have been some chatter in immediate extraction sites when the drill hit the sidewall defect in the extraction socket,similar to other preparation methods. Clearly, with this robotic technology, as with any other technology, proper clinical oversight and judgment must always be exercised. Advanced technology and devices do not replace clinical decision-making but rather augment execution.Static guides have been reported to lead to apical deviations higher than colonel deviations, explained by the way static guides are most effective in the coronal part of the prepared osteotomy with a fulcrum where the drill leaves the guide and enters the tissue.22As haptic robotic guidance of the tool path does not have a similar fulcrum, the increase in apical deviations were not seen this in the present study. The robotic forces resisting deviations of the tip of the tool are not dependent on the depth of the tip of the tool into the osteotomy.The current study showed the depth and angular placement of implants in the maxilla to be slightly more accurate  than  that  of  the  implants  placed  in  the mandible. This is consistent with studies of static guides showing higher accuracy in the completely edentulous maxilla.28,29 This difference may occur because static guides for the maxilla typically cover a larger area than completely edentulous mandibular guides. Of course,this explanation is not relevant to robotic surgery with abone-mounted  registration  method.  However,  the maxilla is more stable and less mobile than the mandible,which may account for a more stable foundation for boththe guides and the robotic splints. Another possibility is that the maxilla typically has lower bone density than the mandible and thus less potential for bur chatter during placement. Nevertheless, other studies have reported greater accuracy in the edentulous mandible.26,30The robotic technique evaluated in this study requires a rigid connection to the patient via a single-patient use,disposable,  bone-mounted  splint  to  register  and dynamically track the jaw with the robot.Figure shows the site of the splint attachment before and after placement. A fiducial array is affixed to this splint after its rigid attachment to the bone. A CBCT scan is then made allowing the registration of the plan into the 3D space of the patient during the procedure. The robot attaches to the splint, providing registration and tracking of the drillin the operative space. The authors observed that, as expected, rigid bone attachment appeared more reliable than tooth or mucosal mounted arrays. There were no complications related to the splint application.Static guides have been reported to be an accurate method for guiding implant placement, and the present study found that robotic guidance was as accurate as the best  implementations  of  static  guides.7,9,14-30 Static guides do, however, come with some inherent limitations that might be overcome with robotics. Both technologies,as well as dynamic computer guidance, benefit from preoperative 3D imaging. This preoperative planning may minimize the size of the incision, as tissue reflection is not needed during surgery to visualize the underlying bone. Static guides are often stacked, providing a drill sleeve that is required for stability. This can, however,create an issue in terms of the length of the stacked guides and the required extended drill lengths. This can be exacerbated in patients with limited mouth opening in the posterior area of the mouth or posteriorly angled implant axes. Robotically guided preparation uses standard drills as the end effector tool.Figure 8 shows intraoperative images of the robotic procedure, demonstrating complete visualization with standard tools. Robotic guidance afforded adequate irrigation as well,which can be an issue with guided osteotomies.Limitations of this clinical study included that no comparative cohort was enrolled. However, this series of participants  represents  the first  robotically  guided completely edentulous preparations. The literature documenting the accuracy of other implant placement techniques along with a well-defined and universally adhered to standard of measuring and reporting accuracy allowed a comparison of this single-series study with previous findings. Another limitation was the risk of bias in studies where the final implant position is assessed by postoperative CBCT scanning. While the radiographic artifacts can be mitigated with manual tuning and scatternoise deletion as described by Arisan et al,34 patient motion artifacts may also introduce errors in the before and after implantation scan registration.24In the present study, the risk of motion artifacts was mitigated by checks in the software program of fiducial registration, which requires minimal motion and indicates any degree of motion that jeopardizes registration accuracy. CONCLUSIONS Based on the findings of this preliminary clinical study,the following conclusions were drawn:1. Implant placement was accurate when using optically guided stereotactic robotic technology for the completely edentulous patient.2. These results show that robotic technology provides a valuable aid to the dental prosthetic and surgical teams during dental implant rehabilitation for the completely edentulous arch.3. Complete visualization of the surgical field of view and ease of use of the system were apparent during these inaugural procedures.4. Based on the widespread use and reliability of robotic technology in other areas of medicine, robotic technology may play a significant role in the accuracy of dental rehabilitation in the future.",-,"1.Mandelaris GA, DeGroot BS.

Sex differences in cardiovascular ageing,Allison A Merz and Susan Cheng,"Abstract Despite recent progress in identifying and narrowing the gaps in cardiovascular outcomes between men and women, general understanding of how and why cardiovascular disease presentations differ between the sexes remains limited. Sex-specific patterns of cardiac and vascular ageing play an important role and, in fact, begin very early in life. Differences between the sexes in patterns of age-related cardiac remodelling are associated with the relatively greater prevalence in women than in men of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Similarly, sex variation in how vascular structure and function change with ageing contributes to differences between men and women in how coronary artery disease manifests typically or atypically over the adult life course. Both hormonal and non-hormonal factors underlie sex differences in cardiovascular ageing and the development of age-related disease. The midlife withdrawal of endogenous oestrogen appears to augment the age-related increase in cardiovascular risk seen in postmenopausal compared with premenopausal women. However, when compared with intrinsic biological differences between men and women that are present throughout life, this menopausal transition may not be as substantial an actor in determining cardiovascular outcomes.","INTRODUCTION In the decades to come, our society will face greater social, economic and medical challenges due to increasing longevity of the average individual and, in turn, the growing number of older adults in the population at large. The number of persons above age 60 will surpass two billion by the year 2015 worldwide.1 While rapid growth of the older demographic is a well-recognised phenomenon, the health-related heterogeneity of older adults is often under appreciated. Despite the fact that many adults experience increasing morbidity with ageing, many others are able to reach even their 90s in excellent health.2 While almost 10% of adults aged 80 years or older will die within the next 2 years, over half will live on for another decade or more.3 Sex differences are a major contributor to the clinical heterogeneity of older age, especially with respect to cardiovascular disease which is still the leading cause of illness and death in the Western world.Cardiovascular disease remains essentially an age-related condition in both men and women. Progressive age-related changes in cardiac and vascular anatomy and physiology—collectively referred to as ‘cardiovascular ageing’—interact with cumulative exposure to traditional risk factors to impact an individual’s increasing likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease over the life course.4 Much work has been done to understand how these changes predispose to eventual disease at an accelerated rate in some individuals and with more delayed timing in others. Herein, we review the current literature describing sex-specific patterns of cardiac and vascular ageing, and discuss how these patterns likely impact the variations in disease presentations and outcomes that are persistently seen between men and women.CARDIAC AGEING Over the life course, the heart progressively remodels and patterns of cardiac remodeling differ between the sexes (table 1 and figure 1). Typical age-related cardiac remodeling involves increasing left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, decreasing LV dimensions and increasing concentricity, all of which are associated with traditional risk factors and incidence of adverse cardiovascular events.56 At all ages, men compared with women have greater absolute values of LV mass, wall thickness and cavity dimensions.6 However, with advancing age and adjusting for body size, women experience a more accelerated increase in LV wall thickness than men, especially in the setting of risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes.7 Furthermore, women experience more age-related concentric remodeling than men,8 which may be accompanied by more pronounced diastolic dysfunction.9 With respect to cardiac systolic function, LV ejection fraction (EF) increases with age in both sexes, and this increase is more pronounced in women.10 Women have also been shown to exhibit greater age-related systolic torsion and circumferential shortening of the LV.11 Together, these findings could be due to an augmented pulsatile load in older women 12 and differential gene expression of extracellular matrix components in pressure overload states.13 Given that functional oestrogen receptors reside in the myocardium, withdrawal of oestrogens at the time of menopause could also contribute to age-related LV remodeling in women.14Sex differences in cardiac ageing patterns likely contribute to differences in cardiac outcomes (figure 2). Although most data on heart failure (HF) prognosis are derived from randomised trials, wherein women are historically underrepresented, the majority of available evidence suggests that women compared to men with HF have an overall better long-term prognosis.15–17 In particular, the more pronounced concentric remodelling seen in older women than men, along with potentially greater diastolic dysfunction,918 could contribute to the higher incidence of HF with preserved EF (HFPEF) than reduced EF (HFREF) that is consistently seen more in women than in men.19 In turn, greater rates of HFPEF could account for better HF outcomes seen in women than in men, given that HFPEF is just as likely as HFREF to lead to HF hospitalisations but less likely to lead to HF deaths. Indeed, considerable evidence suggests that the greater prevalence of HFPEF in women contributes to the female survival benefit. Some studies indicate that the female survival benefit for women with HF persists even after adjusting for LVEF and HF aetiology,16 suggesting that sex differences in age-related biology may also contribute to differences in HF outcomes. Accordingly, biomarkers of inflammation (GDF-15, TNF-αR1a), oxidative stress (MPO), remodelling (syndecan, galectin 3), cariomyocyte stretch (NT proBNP) and arteriosclerosis (ESAM) have all been shown to have sex-specific prognostic value in HF20; however, the extent to which these findings reflect the greater prevalence of HFPEF in women as opposed to distinct differences between the sexes in HF pathophysiology remains unclear and warrants further investigation.VASCULAR AGEING As seen with patterns of cardiac ageing, patterns of vascular ageing also differ between the sexes across the life course and these differences have implications for overt disease risk (table 1 and figure 3). Age-related changes in vascular function generally include increasing endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness, accompanied by increasing systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure.4 Men have greater endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness than women across the age spectrum until the sixth decade, when age-related arterial dysfunction progresses at a faster rate in women. Whereas premenopausal women have lower autonomic tone and baroreceptor response as well as better overall vascular function than men of similar age,2122 postmenopausal women have stiffer arteries than their male counterparts 23 even after accounting for body size and aortic diameter.24 These vascular differences are clinically reflected in patterns of hypertension prevalence over the life course: prior to age 45, more men than women have hypertension; between 45 and 64, hypertension rates are similar between the sexes; and at age 65 and above, more women than men are hypertensive (figure 4C).25 Subclinical changes in arterial structure also differ between men and women. Carotid intima-media thickening (CIMT), coronary artery calcification (CAC) and carotid and femoral atherosclerotic plaques all increase in prevalence with advancing age.26–28 Although more common in men than in women through midlife, sex differences in the prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis and coronary calcium are diminished in later life.2930 Nonetheless, men are overall more likely than women to have severe plaques with associated flow disturbance 30 as well as high-risk morphologic plaque characteristics 31 such as a thin fibrous cap and lipid-rich or necrotic core even after controlling for potential confounders. Interestingly, progression of CIMT is more consistently associated with traditional risk factors in men.32 Because they are highly correlated with traditional risk factors, neither CIMT nor CAC add much prognostic value on top of risk factors in men 33; by contrast, the presence of CAC in women improves risk prediction of CVD in traditionally defined low-risk women 34 and in older women but not older men.33 These findings offer pathophysiological insight into why men are more likely than women to develop typical rather than atypical forms of both subclinical as well as clinical atherosclerotic disease across the lifespan.Sex differences in vascular ageing patterns appear to underlie the extent to which men versus women tend to present with typical versus atypical atherosclerotic disease (figure 2). Classic coronary artery disease (CAD) symptoms and diagnostic findings are relatively consistent across the lifespan in men but vary with age in women. In women, the prevalence of typical obstructive coronary disease is low prior to menopause and then increases dramatically after age 50, affecting only 14% of women below age 45 and up to 79% of women age 75 or older.35 By contrast, non-obstructive CAD is substantially more common in women than in men throughout life and especially in younger age. In the presence of non-obstructive CAD, women are more likely to have microvascular and/or endothelial dysfunction, in addition to conditions such as epicardial and microvascular spasm, myocardial bridging and conduit vessel stiffening, all of which can lead to myocardial ischaemia.36 Women have also been found to have thicker arteriolar walls than men in the presence of CAD.37 Accordingly, women are more likely than men to experience angina, ischaemia and acute coronary syndrome in the presence of non-obstructive CAD.36 It has been proposed that both microvascular disease and epicardial atherosclerosis originate from arterial intimal injury but develop preferentially in women versus men based on sex differences in vascular remodeling and reactivity related to hormonal exposures and risk factor clustering.38 The relatively greater prevalence of non-obstructive CAD in women, which is less easily diagnosed and treated than obstructive CAD,3639 may well contribute to the consistently reported worse outcomes related to acute coronary syndromes in women than in men 40. Although men are more frequently diagnosed with acute coronary syndromes each year,41 women have an almost double mortality rate at 30 days 42 and a 25% greater odds of having an adverse cardiac event at 6 months.43 Notably, women up to 55 years old represent a major demographic in whom CAD mortality has not markedly declined in recent decades.44 BEYOND THE MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION The more pronounced age-related cardiovascular risk seen in postmenopausal compared with premenopausal women is commonly attributed to the midlife withdrawal of endogenous sex steroids, often referred to as the ‘menopausal transition’. However, recent experimental and population data suggest that hormonal changes alone are unlikely to completely explain observed sex differences in cardiovascular presentations and outcomes. On the one hand, the potential relationship between endogenous oestrogen and cardiovascular disease is supported by several lines of evidence 45: the existence of oestrogen receptors in the myocardium, vascular endothelium, smooth muscle and adventitial cells 46; genomic and non-genomic effects of oestrogen on endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells 47 and an inverse association between brachial artery flow-mediated dilation and years since menopause 48 coupled with a positive association between serum E2 levels and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation in postmenopausal women.49 On the other hand, only a limited number of longitudinal studies have investigated associations between circulating sex steroids, sex hormone binding globulin levels and incident CAD with variable results.4450 In addition, a meta-analysis of observational studies found no convincing associations between postmenopausal status or average age of menopause and outcomes.51 The extent to which menopause versus biological ageing processes contribute to age-related cardiovascular risk in women remains a subject of ongoing debate. The question is methodologically challenging to investigate given the concurrent timing and interrelatedness of these two processes.52 Data from several large-scale transition and cohort studies offer some insights. In the Study of Women Across the Nation, only select lipid measures including LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B changed within a year of a woman’s last menstrual period; common cardiovascular risk factors changed in association with age, but not with menopause.53 Similarly, data from the Framingham Heart Study have suggested that cardiovascular risk status, represented by weight, blood pressure and total cholesterol level, influences age at menopause and not vice versa.54 Nonetheless, it should be recognised that risk factor levels in women can indeed change around the time of menopause, and in some cases dramatically,55 likely related to the combination of chronologic ageing and the menopausal transition. Thus, irrespective of the ultimate cause, women should be made aware that their cardiovascular risk is likely to increase around the time of menopause and women should be counselled regarding the importance of risk factor modification and therapeutic lifestyle changes. Risk factor monitoring should be prioritised to identify women who may benefit from pharmacologic risk factor management.With respect to the possible role of menopause in conferring cardiovascular risk, additional insights can be gained from examining age-based trends in the incidence of breast cancer, a condition that is biologically more clearly related to endogenous oestrogen levels. The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) demonstrated that breast cancer incidence and related mortality were lower for postmenopausal women who took oestrogen alone as compared with placebo,5657 regardless of when hormone therapy was initiated. By contrast, major trials of hormone therapy in menopause including the WHI have demonstrated no obvious reduction in either subclinical CVD 58 or overt CVD outcomes,565960 although with some evidence suggesting that hormone therapy initiated at an earlier versus later age could confer more protective than harmful cardiovascular effects.61 In fact, a fair amount of data support the hypothesis that the cardioprotective effects of hormone therapy are time dependent and more beneficial than harmful if started in the perimenopausal or early postmenopausal period rather than late after menopause. Accordingly, experimental and physiology data also suggest differential effects of oestrogen on vascular reactivity depending on when therapy is initiated with respect to age and menopausal status.62 Population studies also offer additional insights regarding the contrasting patterns of age-related cardiovascular versus breast cancer risk. Two decades ago, Elizabeth Barrett-Connor analysed mortality statistics and suggested that menopause itself has no discernible effect on the exponential increase in coronary death with age, given that coronary death rates in women do not markedly accelerate after menopause, in contrast to the relatively abrupt drop in deaths attributable to breast cancer.63 Updated national mortality data from the US Centers for Disease Control continue to support this observation (figure 4),64 where the apparent perimenopausal increase in CAD mortality in women may actually be more reflective of a relative decrease in CAD mortality in men, beginning around age 45. Thus, it has been suggested that the observed gender gap is not primarily due to oestrogen deficiency but instead due to CAD mortality rates that tend to decrease in men while continuing to steadily rise in women with advancing age.65 Importantly, observational studies have noted that the sexual dimorphism in both subclinical and clinical cardiovascular phenotypes exists in prepuberty,66–68 suggesting that intrinsic non-hormonal factors acting throughout the life course may play a more important role than midlife hormonal shifts, with respect to sex differences in cardiovascular risk. CONCLUSIONS Over the past two decades, tremendous progress has been made in identifying and narrowing the gaps in cardiovascular outcomes observed between men and women. Despite this progress, general understanding of how and why manifestations of cardiovascular disease differ between the sexes remains limited. Evidence to date indicates that the development and progression of cardiovascular disease varies between women and men due to both intrinsic biological sex differences as well as sex differences in how age-related changes in cardiac and vascular anatomy and physiology progress over the life course. Although men are more susceptible to typical subclinical and clinical vascular changes beginning earlier in life, women are more at risk for atypical vascular disease in general in addition to more accelerated age-related vascular changes at midlife—predisposing them to both typical and atypical manifestations in older age. Given the acceleration in arterial stiffness and subclinical atherosclerosis that can be seen in perimenopausal women, in particular, coupled with changes in cardiac remodeling and diastolic function, a key target for risk factor modification is hypertension. Ideally, hypertension or even prehypertension should be targeted for treatment well prior to the onset of menopause, if present. Targeting premature chronic elevations in arterial pressure and afterload may, in turn, prove to be the most efficacious strategy for preventing HFPEF in older women as well as in older men. It is well recognised that hormone therapy should not be used for long-term chronic disease prevention, as it may increase cardiovascular risk in some older women and especially women farther out from menopause. As it turns out, avoidance of hormone therapy in ageing women is not likely to represent a substantially missed opportunity. While considerable evidence has pointed to the influence of the menopausal withdrawal of endogenous oestrogen on the increase in age-related cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal compared with premenopausal women, chronologic ageing processes acting on top of inherent biological differences between men and women likely play a more important role.Acknowledgments We acknowledge that references to the work of many investigators were omitted due to the word limit for this manuscript.Funding This work was supported by the Ellison Foundation (SC) and NIH/NHLBI grant R00HL107642 (SC).",-,"1.

Glycaemic disorders in denture stomatitis,"Ljubomir Vitkov, Raimund Weitgasser, Alois Lugstein, Michael J. Noack, Karl Fuchs and Wolf  Dietrich Krautgartne","The prevalence of glycaemic disorders was investigated  in native Upper-Austrians with  Candida-associated denture stomatitis. All patients with  previously unknown diabetes mellitus were subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and as a result  diabetes was diagnosed in 13% of the patients over 50 years of age. Thirty-five percent of all inspected patients over 50 years of age with denture stomatitis had type 2 diabetes mellitus and 36% had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The correlation between  Candida-associated denture stomatitis and diabetes mellitus indicates a means for the early diagnosis of diabetes.  Hyperglycaemia could not be a predisposition to denture stomatitis, since all patients with denture stomatitis in the age-bracket 26-50 years were without diabetes and only very few of the older patients with diabetes were obese. The correlation between  Candida-associated denture stomatitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus could be traced  back to a reduced resistance to Candidu that preceded  the  diabetes.  Key words: Candida; denture stomatitis; diabetes mellitus; impaired fasting giucose; impaired giucose tolerance","Inflammation located on the denture- bearing mucosa at which  Candida can be isolated in large numbers is named Candidu-associated denture stomatitis (DS). The prevalence of DS varies widely in  different populations - 8% in Native Americans (1) and 40% in Danes (2). Wearing dentures  does not necessarily  cause stomatitis, so a reduced resistance to Candidu could be of importance for  the development  of  Candida- associated DS. The relevance of a possible immune deficiency in mucocutaneous candidiasis was for a long  time taken  into  consideration (3). The supposition that diabetes mellitus (DM) could be a predisposition to Candida- associated DS gave rise to some investigations, but  these did not distinguish between different disorders of  glycaemia  (1, 4, 5) or distinguished only be- tween type 1 DM and type 2 DM (6-8).  Whether or not there was a  significant difference in the density of Candidu on the oral mucosa between diabetics and non-diabetics was not clear. Frequently occurring urinary  tract Candida  infections (9) in people  with  type 2 DM are an indication that reduced resistance to Candida could be the  reason. There are large differences in the prevalence of the major  forms of diabetes among racial or ethnic groups worldwide (10). The diabetic  syndrome is a genetically and clinically  heterogeneous group of disorders that share glucose intolerance in common (10, I I). Therefore, a possible connection between  diabetes and Candida-associated DS  can  not be related to hyperglycemia alone. The aim  of this  study was to investigate the prevalence of the glycaemic disorders in native Upper-Austrians with Candida-associated DS.  Material and methods Oral examination and microbiological investigations DS was diagnosed during routine  oral inspections in 82 native Upper-Austrians who were continuous  denture wearers. They were not HIV-positive and had not been  treated  with immunosuppressive drugs,  radiotherapy or antibiotics. The diagnostic  criteria (Table 1) suggested by NEWTON (12) were used. To estimate   the   candidal density, samples were taken  with  swabs (Biotest Transport system; Biotest AG, Dreieich, Germany) from about 1 cm2 of the denture-bearing mucosa. The sampling took place between the morning hours of 09:OO and 12:00, at least 2 h after the patient’s breakfast. In addition, samples were taken in the same way from a control group of 20 women and 20 men denture  wearers in the  age-bracket 26 83 years (mean 59 years), having neither diseases of the oral mucosa nor angular cheilitis. All samples were evaluated semiquantitatively by inoculating agar plates (Albicans ID; BioMerieux, Marcy l’etoile, France) aerobically incubated at 37°C for 48 h  after  the following counting procedure: Negative growth was characterised by 0-4 colonies per agar plate. This candidal  density has no clinical relevance to Candida-associated   DS, since the presence of Candida as a facultative  pathogen  could be registered in almost every second  subject (13); Low candidal density was identified by the  growth of at least 5 colonies per agar plate; Moderate  density was identified by growth over half the agar plate; High density was identilied by confluent growth of Candida. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGlT) Drug intake affecting blood sugar levels (11) was stopped by the  family physicians 3 days before the examination. All patients   with   Candida-associated DS who were not known to be diabetics were subjected to an OGTT. An un- restricted diet rich in carbohydrates was recommended for at least 3 days before the OGTT, and normal physical activity was advised.  After  a  fasting period of 10-12 h,  baseline  blood   glucose was measured. The patients were required to drink 75 g of glucose as a 25% solution within 5 min and to remain  seated before and during the 2-h test. The results from the test were interpreted according to the WHO criteria (Table 2) (14). OGTT results that do not meet these criteria are  abnormal but  are considered  non-diagnostic. Recently, fasting capillary  plasma glucose levels  in the range 100-126 mg/dl have been  defined by the  American  Diabetes  Association (10) as impaired  fasting glucose (IFG). Since the development of DM depends on age (10, 1 l), the patients were divided into two groups: the first group (20 patients) was in the age-bracket 26 50 years  (mean 36 years), and the second (62 patients) in the age-bracket 51- 83 years (mean 65 years). Results Oral examination and microbiological investigations DS was manifested clinically through an erythematous reaction of the  denture- bearing  mucosa (in 93%  of the patients examined on the mucosa of the maxilla only). DS type I was registered only in patients with IGT or DM (Fig. 1). Of the diabetics, 63% were aware of their DS and  stated that they had acquired DS shortly after receiving the maxillary denture, many years before the onset of DM. Only 28% of them were having burning or painful sensations, given as the reason for an oral examination and consequently for the diagnosis of DS. The remaining diabetics had no complaints, and their DS was diagnosed during a routine oral examination. Unlike  the  control  group, in which only negative candidal growth could be registered,  the  microbiological  examination shows in every patient with DS a pathologically increased candidal count ranging from low to high candidal  density  (Fig. 2). Candida albicans was the most     frequently     identified species (goyo). Glycaemic disorders Six of the patients were obese according to the stipulated criteria   (1 1) (more than 20% overweight). The  patients  in the first group (Fig. 3) were divided into subjects   with   normoglycemia, IFG, IGT without obesity, and IGT with obesity. From the OGTT and the data obtained from  family  physicians, the following  divisions  within the second group (Fig. 4) were ascertainable: 1. Patients with type 2 DM: 35%. Only 9% of them were obese; 2. Patients with IGT and IFG: 39%; 3. Patients with normoglycemia: 26%. DM was diagnosed in 13%  of the patients  with  Candida-associated DS over 50 years of age and subjected to OGTT. The diagnosis of DM was confirmed by a  second OGTT a week later. Discussion Since the human mucosae serve as a natural Candida reservoir (15) and the quantity of Candida in denture plaque depends strongly on   the age   of the plaque (1 6, 17), sampling from denture- bearing mucosa was preferred. The candidal density in  patients having DS with normoglycaemia was not significantly higher  compared  with that in patients with hyperglycemia. This result confirms the findings of previous  investigations related to oral candidal density (4, 7,8) in patients having normoglycaemia or DM, but contradicts other findings (5, 6).  The  elevated  glucose level in  saliva from diabetics (7) could be a  possible reason for  a higher count of fungal organisms in diabetic subjects compared to subjects with normoglycaemia. Furthermore, the only clear difference found in the present  investigation  between patients with glucose intolerance and those with normoglycaemia   was the occurrence of DS type I exclusively in subjects with glucose intolerance. All the  patients in the first group (26-50 years) were non-diabetics.  The patients in the  second group (51-83 years) had mainly IGT or type  2 DM and only 26% had   normoglycaemia. The  significant number of diabetic  subjects in the second group shows that a positive correlation exists between  Candida-associated DS and type 2 DM. Such a correlation, and hence the possibility to make an early  diagnosis of DM, was also  suggested in studies of candidal  balanoposthitis and vaginitis (18). The glycaemic disorders in   patients  with Candida-associated DS are restricted to type 2 DM, to IGT and to IFG. IGT and IFG refer to the intermediate metabolic stage between normal glucose  homeostasis and diabetes (10). The insignificant number of patients in each  decade of life does not allow the elucidation of whether all subjects from the population  concerned  should have type 2 DM or not when  advanced in years,  since the incidence  of DM increases  with  age (10). To answer that question, further investigations are necessary. Nevertheless, it  is  obvious that a  high probability exists that Upper- Austrians over  50 years of age  with Candida-associated   DS, will develop type 2 DM. DM was diagnosed in 13% of patients over 50 years of age  with DS,  who were subjected to the glucose tolerance test. On the basis of the correlation between  Cundida-associated DS and type 2 DM, it would  be  possible to make an  early diagnosis  of  diabetes among the  population concerned by means of a  suitable screening test  (19). The occurrence of DS in patients under 45 years of age, when the incidence (19) of type 2  DM is very low, as well as the occurrence of DS preceding DM, does not indicate that DM could promote DS. The infrequency  of DS in type 2 diabetics with obesity [60-90% of all diabetics  in Western  societies (1 l)] is an indication that the hyperglycaemia itself could hardly be a predisposing factor   for DS. The hyperglycaemia, though, can lead to some nutritional stimulation of  Candida (7). The correlation between   Candida-associated DS and type 2 DM can be explained by the presumption of  reduced  resistance to Candida. This  could be a  consequence of the following disorders: 1. Defective     cellular immunity against Candida,  which  has  been  described in chronic  mucocutaneous candidiasis (3); 2. Quantitative (xerostomia) or qualitative disorders of  salivary secretion (2, 3); 3. Decreased   local   epithelial resistance. In experimental  animals whose immune system    was    compromised through mouse leukaemia,  the  surrogate epithelial    defence    mechanisms limited the proliferation of Candida (20). Oral epithelial  dysplasia and leukoplakia are often associated    with chronic  hyperplastic  candidosis  (2), so it  is  possible that some reduction in lo- cal epithelial  resistance is involved  in these disorders. The denture could be considered a promoter of Candida-associated DS that takes  effect only if reduced resistance to Cundida exists.

"Global cancer incidence in older adults, 2012 and 2035: A population-based study","Sophie Pilleron, Diana Sarfati, Maryska Janssen-Heijnen, Jérôme Vignat, Jacques Ferlay, Freddie Bray and Isabelle Soerjomataram","Population ageing has substantially contributed to the rising number of new cancer cases worldwide. We document cancer incidence patterns in 2012 among older adults globally, and examine the changing magnitude of cancer in this age group over the next decades. Using GLOBOCAN 2012 data, we presented the number and proportion of new cancer cases, and the truncated age-standardised incidence rates among adults aged 65 years and older for all cancer sites combined and for the five most common cancer sites by world region. We calculated the incidence in 2035 by applying population projections, assuming no changes in rates. In2012,6.7million new cancer cases (47.5% of all cancers) were diagnosed among older adults worldwide,with marked regional disparities. Nearly 48% of these cases occurred in less developed regions. Lung, colorectal, prostate,stomach and breast cancers represented 55% of the global incidence, yet distinct regional patterns were observed. We predict 14 million new cancer cases by 2035, representing almost 60% of the global cancer incidence. The largest relative increase in incidence is predicted in the Middle East and Northern Africa (+157%), and in China (+155%). Less developed regions will see an increase of new cases by 144%, compared to 54% in more developed regions. The expected increase in cancer incidence at older ages will have substantial economic and social impacts globally, posing considerable and unique challenge to healthcare systems in every world region, especially in those with limited resources and weaker health systems. Key words:neoplasms, epidemiology, older adults, population-based cancer registries Abbreviations:ASR: age-standardised rate; GICR: Global Initiative for Cancer Registry; IARC: International Agency for Research on Cancer; ICD: International Classification of Diseases","Introduction Due to ongoing demographic and epidemiological transitions,the global burden of cancer is rapidly increasing, with the 14 million new cancer cases in 2012 expected to rise to 24 million new cancer cases in 2035.1A key driver is the rapidly rising number of older people worldwide - the absolute number of people aged 65 years and older is expected to double in the next two decades in all world regions including those with limited resources at present.2 Cancer management in older people can be complex; comorbidity, polypharmacy and physiologic age-related changes can affect how and when cancer is diagnosed, whether or not treatment is offered and the individual tolerance to anticancer therapy.3–5 Moreover, older people are often excluded from randomised controlled trials, and thus evidence relating to the efficacy of cancer treatment in this population is frequently absent or incomplete.6In addition, the survival gap between younger and older cancer patients is widening over time.7 The growing cancer burden at older ages is likely to result in major economic challenges in the provision of clinical and health services that adequately meet these needs over the coming decades.An in-depth global description of the burden of cancer at older ages is therefore long overdue; there are few reports on the epidemiology of cancer among older adults, and these have tended to be at the national level and mainly conducted in more developed countries.8–11 This study, therefore, examines the current and future global patterns of cancer incidence among adults aged 65 and older by world region as a means to provide critical insight for policy makers into developing global cancer control policies in their region for this rapidly growing population.Material and Methods Data sources and statistical analyses Cancer incidence estimates for 2012 in 184 countries were obtained from the GLOBOCAN database held at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).1 Incidence data were available for 27 cancer sites plus all cancer sites combined,excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (ICD-10 C00-97, exceptC44), and for 10 age groups (0–14, 15–39, 40–44, 45–49,50–54,55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, 75 and over) by sex.Numbers of new cases among adults aged 65 years and older,as well as 0–64 and 75+ years old, and truncated age-standardised incidence rates (ASR per 100,000) for all cancer sites combined and the five most common cancers were reported for more and less developed regions, as defined by the United Nations 2 and for seven world regions: (i)Asia(eastern,south-east, south-central Asia excluding China and India), (ii)Europe (eastern, northern, southern and western Europe), (iii)Latin America and the Caribbean (central, southern America and the Caribbean), (iv) Middle East and North Africa (western Asia and northern Africa), (v) northern America (United States of America and Canada), (vi) Oceania (Australia, New Zealand and pacific islands)and(vii) sub-Saharan Africa (eastern, mid-dle, southern and western Africa). In reporting the estimates,China and India, given their relative population sizes, were presented separately. The truncated ASR were calculated for the age group 65+ were compared to equivalent summary rates for ages 0–64, standardised using the world standard population of Segi,revised by Dollet al.12We also computed the number of new cancer cases occurring in adults aged 65 years and older as a proportion of the total cancer diagnoses by sex and world region. Lastly, we predicted the future number of new cancer cases for all cancer sites combined by world region in 2035 for the age groups 0–64, 65+ and 75+ by applying sex- and age-specific incidence rates in 2012 to United Nations population projections using the medium fertility variant for the year 2035.2Role of the funding source The funders had no role in study design, collection, analysis or interpretation of data or writing of the report.

Most of the new cancer cases occurred in Europe (1.9 million, 29% of the world total) and Asia (2.8 million, 42%) including 1.5 million cases diagnosed in China(22% of the world total–Table 1) whereas people aged 65 years and older in these respective regions represented 22, 39 and 31% of the world older population, respectively.Nearly 48% of all new cancer cases among older adults occurred in less developed regions where more than 60% of older adults live. The geographical pattern of ASR is shown for both males and females in Figure 1. The truncated incidence rates among older males varied from 716 per 100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa to 2,544 per 100,000 in Oceania(Table 1), while in females, rates ranged from 337 per 100,000 in India to 1,540 per 100,000 in northern America. Overall, anine-fold difference in rates among older adults was found across countries worldwide, from 261 in Niger to 2,226 in Denmark (Supporting Information Appendix pp. 2–5). For the purposes of comparison, a similar degree of variation was observed in the 0–64 age group, but with much lower ASR in the latter age group, ranging from 33 per 100,000 in The Gambia  to  214  per  100,000  in  the  Republic  of  Korea(Supporting Information Appendix p. 6).Geographical patterns of rates were very similar for bothsexes, although incidence rates were consistently 15–90%higher in men compared to women (Table 1). When excluding sex-specific cancers–for example, prostate and testis cancer in males and breast, cervical, corpus uteri and ovarian cancers in females–the magnitude of sex difference was even higher (60–160%–Supporting Information Appendix p. 7).The percentage of all new cancer cases that occurred among older adults ranged from 35% in sub-Saharan Africa to 60% in Oceania among males and from 22% in sub-Saharan Africa to 53% in Europe among females (Supporting Information Appendix p. 8). The lowest percentage within specific countries was observed in the United Arab Emirates for both males and females (12 and 5%, respectively), with the highest percentage in Japan, also in both sexes (76 and 67%among males and females), respectively.Major cancer sites among older adults Among older males, prostate cancer was the leading cancer globally (Fig. 2) and in all regions, except in Asia where lung cancer exceeded all other cancers (Fig. 3a). Lung and colorectal cancer were also common cancers in most regions. Liver cancer was frequent among older males in Asia, Middle East and North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, and stomach cancer was the second most diagnosed cancer in Asia. These five cancers represented over two-thirds of the total burden of cancer among those aged 65 years and older in all regions.Among older females, breast cancer was the leading cancer globally (Fig. 2) and in most world regions, except in Asia Including China and sub-Saharan Africa where colorectum,lung and cervical cancers were more common, respectively(Fig. 3b). Similar to males, liver was a leading cancer site in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, while colorectal cancer was one of the five main cancersites in all regions. The proportion of the total burden of cancers in this age group explained by the top five cancers was less than among males but still represented between 46% in Middle East and North Africa, and 66% in China (Fig. 2b).For comparison, the five most common cancer sites for 0–64 and 75+ years old are displayed by sex in Supporting Information Appendix pp. 9–10 and pp. 11–12, respectively.In terms of rates of the specific main cancer sites, Oceania,northern America and Europe had the highest rates of prostate and colorectal cancers among older males and the highest rate of  breast  and  colorectal  cancers  among  older  females(Supporting Information Appendix p. 13). Asia (including China and India) had the highest rates of liver and stomach cancer among older females and males, whereas the lowest rates of lung, and colorectal cancers were observed in sub-Saharan Africa for both sexes. The magnitude of difference in rates across regions varied according to cancer site. The largest variation was for lung cancer, with a 14-fold higher rate in northern America (325 per 100,000 in both sexes combined) compared to sub-Saharan Africa (24 per 100,000). A nine-fold difference was observed combined for colorectal cancer between Oceania(286 per 100,000) and sub-Saharan Africa (32 per 100,000). The magnitude of the differences was smallest for liver cancer, whererates varied three-fold (from 29 per 100,000 Northern Americato 89 per 100,000 in Asia in both sexes).Future burden of cancer among older adults Overall, the number of new cancer cases (all cancer sites combined) is expected to double by 2035 (14.0 million) among older adults; from 3.9 to 8.5 million (a 118% increase) among older males, and from 2.8 to 5.7 million among older females(a 104% increase). This rise is observed in all world regions(Fig. 4), with the greatest relative increase expected in Middle East and North Africa (157%) and the smallest relative increase in Europe (47%). The increase is expected to be much larger in less developed regions with an estimated increase of 144% by 2035, as compared to 54% in the more developed regions.In absolute terms, the greatest number of additional cases are projected to be in China (2.3 million additional cases) followed by Asia (1.1 million), Europe (0.9 million) and North America (0.8 million). By 2035, older adults are predicted to represent 58% of the total cancer incidence burden globally. In Northern America, Europe, Oceania and China, over two thirds of all cases will be diagnosed among older adults (Fig. 5).As a comparison, the number of cancer cases among adults aged 0–64 years will decrease in Europe over the same period(−3% all sexes combined; Supporting Information Appendix p. 14) and will increase in other world regions but at a lower rate than among the older age group (ranging from +4% in northern America to +78% in Middle-East and North Africa).Among adults aged 75 years and older, similar increase as the 65+ years was observed, that is, +126% in older males and +106% in older females (Supporting Information Appendix p. 15).Discussion Almost seven million new cancer cases were diagnosed among adults aged 65 and older in 2012 worldwide and about half of all cancer cases occurred in less developed regions. At global and regional levels, a disproportionate part of this burden is borne by men as incidence rates were 15–90% higher among older males than females. Prostate, breast, lung and colorectal cancers were the main contributors of the burden in most regions but infection-related cancers represented a greater share of the burden in less developed regions. By 2035, the number of new cancer cases among older persons is expected to double, with rises observed uniformly in all regions: 58% of all new cases in 2035 will be among older adults aged 65 years and over, as compared to 48% in 2012. While the relative increase is greater in less developed countries, the higher proportion of older people in more developed countries indicates that the absolute increase in these regions will be substantial.This is likely to lead to substantial pressure on health services,and bring major economic and societal costs.Given the rapid projected increase in cancers among older people, there is an urgent need to focus on comprehensive cancer control strategies for this age group, which are tailored to local needs and priorities. Preventive strategies focused on the most frequent incident cancers within each region are likely to be critical,13 particularly in less developed regions with limited financial and human resources, including oncology capacity to provide the necessary cancer care to an ageing population.14,15 Contrary to other world regions, in China breast cancer did not contribute to the five most frequent cancers diagnosed among females aged 65 years and older. Recent studies have indeed reported younger age at diagnosis among breast cancer patients in China compared to Europe or the United States of America.16,17 Further studies to assess possible biological reasons to this pattern are warranted. Additionally, in China,lung cancer is the leading cancer in older females and males.Though the high smoking rates in older Chinese males can explain our finding, smoking is not probably the main risk factor among older Chinese females since smoking rates are quite low among females.18,19 Chinese women are however particularly exposed to secondhand smoking and high levels of high household air pollution originating mainly from cooking with poor ventilation or heating stoves using biomass, coal and other solid fuels.20 Moreover, outdoor air pollution particulate matters mainly derived from natural phenomena,anthropogenic  and  industrial  activities  and  traffic-related sources  through  the  combustion  of  coal  and  petroleum products may also explain part of this finding.From a life course perspective, the preceding age group 45–64 years is seen as a crucial window of opportunity for cancer prevention that can impact on reducing the burden at older ages.21 This midlife influence of behavioural, social and environmental risk determinants of health accumulates and may presage health and well-being in later life.21 Given the cancer profiles at older ages observed in this study andthe high prevalence of modifiable lifestyle factors among the middle-aged within the more developed regions, interventions aiming at reducing factors such as smoking, obesity, physical inactivity and diet should be pursued. Yet evidence suggests that cancer prevention is also effective at older ages. Smoking Cessation at later ages still can reduce the risk of lung cancer,22 obesity at older age remains a risk factor for cancer,23 physical activity reduces the risk of colon cancer in this age group,24 while adherence to dietary recommendations may also lower the risk of cancer among older adults.25In less developed regions, namely in sub-Saharan Africa,some Asian countries such as India and, to some extent, Latin America and the Caribbean, infection-related cancers, mainly liver, gastric and cervical cancers, were important contributors to the burden of cancer among older adults. Strategies to deal with these cancers earlier in life, for example, reduction of the likelihood of infection as well as vaccination for hepatitis Band Human Papilloma Virus, will have a long-term benefit among those aged 65 years and older.Cancer screening at older ages–that is, 75 years old andover–has been discouraged due to lack of randomised clinical trials including this age group and to concerns of the negative impact of screening, for example, anxiety, over-diagnosis, false reassurance from an erroneously negative test,complications related to the screening test and over-treatment.26The decision to screen or not to screen older adults depends not only on age but also on other factors including healthy life expectancy,27 cognitive status, risk of disease and notably, individual choice.28 For the latter, this implies that older adults understand the risks and benefits of the screening intervention being offered.There are complexities inherent in treating cancer among older populations. The paucity of evidence on the benefits and risks of treatment among older patients partly stems from their common exclusion from clinical trials.6,29,30 There is emerging  evidence  of  possible  under-treatment  of  older people,31 for instance, a large European study has reported that the odds of being treated with breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy decreases with increasing age,32 despite a recent SEER analysis showing a significant survival benefit of adjuvant radiation after breast conserving surgery among older patients.33 While there is substantial heterogeneity among older people in terms of their general health status, cancer diagnosis and  management  are  commonly  influenced  by  the  co-existence of other diseases or conditions (comorbidity). The prevalence  of  comorbid  conditions  among  older  cancer patients is high, for example, in the United States one-third to one-half of older cancer patients were found to have comorbid conditions.34 Comorbidities are associated with poorer survival, lower treatment receipt, poorer quality of life, higher health care costs and longer (and, therefore, more expensive) hospital stay, especially for cancers that generally have better prognosis.3,34,35 Due to a heterogeneity in the health status and prognosis in older cancer patients, chronological age is not a meaningful guide to treatment and long-term follow-up. For example, the International  Society  of  Geriatric  Oncology  recommends comprehensive geriatric assessments, for example, functional status, comorbidities cognition, mental health status, fatigue,social status and support, nutrition and presence of geriatric symptoms 36,  to  allow  tailored  care  for  these  patients.37 Evidence suggests that these broad-based assessments are likely to have a positive effect both on completion of treatment, treatment toxicity and cancer survival within older age groups.37,38 Further research is, however, required to assess the particular needs of older cancer patients, and optimal cancer control strategies for this population according to level ofresource.To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of the global incidence of cancer in older populations that incorporates regional comparisons and the projection of the burden by 2035. However, GLOBOCAN estimates should be interpreted with some caution as estimations are based on the availability and the quality of national incidence and mortality data.39 In countries where national mortality data were available but national or subnational cancer registries were not, national incidence estimation relied on national mortality estimates and modelled survival.39 However, mortality data may be less accurate for older age groups; where vital statistics system exists, mortality data rely on the accuracy of the information written on the death certificate. Identifying the underlying cause of death may be challenging in older adults who may present several comorbidities. In many low resource countries,verbal autopsy is the only method currently available to obtain estimates of the distribution of causes of death but the method may be less reliable in older age groups.40 Furthermore, there is a higher probability of under-ascertainment of cancer cases at older age groups, notably in developing countries, where diagnostic facilities access to care may be limited. Robust cancer incidence data remains an overwhelming need in less developed regions, and the Global Initiative for Cancer Registry development (GICR) coordinated by IARC is ensuring all world regions have access to high-quality cancer data to inform cancer control planning (http://gicr.iarc.fr). Our projections did not take into account historical trends in cancer incidence. However, our projections for all cancer sites combined at global and regional levels are likely to be underestimated.  Worldwide  we  have  observed  increases  in  the incidence of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer, especially in countries in transition. These cancer sites greatly affect our study population, and these countries contribute to a large proportion of the cancer burden in older adults. This risingrate is partially compensated by the decrease of infection-related cancers, notably stomach and cervical cancers, in very high, high and medium resource countries.41 Unfortunately,95% uncertainty intervals for the cancer estimates were not calculated for GLOBOCAN 2012 estimates and therefore are not presented in this study. Nonetheless, the quality of the data sources used to estimate the cancer burden have previously been assessed and reported,39 and this provides a good indication as to the uncertainty surrounding the cancer esti-mate. As for the uncertainty surrounding the projection, the use of low or high variants for the population estimates did not impact our projection.Conclusions Given the expected two-fold rise in number of new cancer cases among older adults, and the major economic, societaland health system impacts that will ensue, there is a need for improvements in cancer surveillance to assist the development of geriatric oncological practice, and a global action plan to control cancer in older adults.

The Legacy Effect in Type 2 Diabetes: Impact of Early Glycemic Control on Future Complications(The Diabetes & Aging Study),"Neda Laiteerapong, Sandra A. Ham, Yue Gao, Howard H. Moffet, Jennifer Y. Liu, Elbert S. Huang, and Andrew J. Karter","OBJECTIVE To examine for a legacy effect of early glycemic control on diabetic complications and death.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This cohort study of managed care patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 10 years of survival (1997–2013, average follow-up 13.0 years,N= 34,737)examined associations between HbA1c<6.5% (<48 mmol/mol), 6.5% to<7.0%(48 to<53 mmol/mol), 7.0% to<8.0% (53 to<64 mmol/mol), 8.0% to<9.0%(64 to<75 mmol/mol), or‡9.0% (‡75 mmol/mol) for various periods of early exposure (0–1, 0–2, 0–3, 0–4, 0–5, 0–6, and 0–7 years) and incident future microvascular (end-stage renal disease, advanced eye disease, amputation) and macrovascular (stroke, heart disease/failure, vascular disease) events and death,adjusting for demographics, risk factors, comorbidities, and later HbA1c.RESULTS Compared with HbA1c<6.5% (<48 mmol/mol) for the 0-to-1-year early exposure period, HbA1c levels‡6.5% (‡48 mmol/mol) were associated with increased microvascular and macrovascular events (e.g., HbA1c6.5% to<7.0% [48 to<53 mmol/mol] microvascular: hazard ratio 1.204 [95% CI 1.063–1.365]), and HbA1c levels‡7.0% (‡53 mmol/mol) were associated with increased mortality(e.g., HbA1c7.0% to<8.0% [53 to<64 mmol/mol]: 1.290 [1.104–1.507]). Longer periods of exposure to HbA1c levels‡8.0% (‡64 mmol/mol) were associated withincreasing microvascular event and mortality risk.CONCLUSIONS Among patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and 10 years of survival, HbA1c levels‡6.5% (‡48 mmol/mol) for the 1st year after diagnosis were associated with worse outcomes. Immediate, intensive treatment for newly diagnosed patients may be necessary to avoid irremediable long-term risk for diabetic complications and mortality.","In the U.S., an estimated 1.4 million adults are newly diagnosed with diabetes every year and present an important intervention opportunity for health care systems.In patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, the benefits of maintaining an HbA1c,7.0% (,53 mmol/mol) are well established. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) found that a mean HbA1cof 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) lowers the risk of diabetes-related end points by 12–32%compared with a mean HbA1cof 7.9%(63 mmol/mol) (1,2). Long-term observational follow-up of this trial revealed that this early glycemic control has durable effects: Reductions in microvascular events persisted, reductions in cardiovascular events and mortality were observed 10 years after the trial ended, and HbA1c values converged (1).Similar Findings were observed in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial(DCCT) in patients with type 1 diabetes(2–4). These post trial observations have been called legacy effects (also metabolic memory) (5), and they suggest the importance of early glycemic control for the prevention of future complications of diabetes. Although these clinical trial long-term follow-up studies demonstrated legacy effects, whether legacy effects exist in real-world populations,how soon after diabetes diagnosis legacy effects may begin, or for what level of glycemic control legacy effects may exist are not known.In a previous retrospective cohort study,we found that patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and an initial 10-year HbA1c trajectory that was unstable (i.e.,changed substantially over time) had an increased risk for future cardiovascular events, even after adjusting for HbA1c exposure (6). In the same cohort population, this study evaluates associations between the duration and intensity of glycemic control immediately after diagnosis and the long-term incidence of future diabetic complications and mortality. We hypothesized that a glycemic legacy effect exists in real-world populations, begins as early as the 1st year after diabetes diagnosis, and depends on the level of glycemic exposure.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Source Population Since 1993, the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Diabetes Registry has maintained a cohort of patients with diabetes (7,8). Patients with diabetes are identified through an algorithm that is based on any of the following:1)inpatient diagnosis (principal diagnosis of ICD-9 code 250),2) outpatient diagnosis(two or more diagnoses with ICD-9 code 250, excluding diagnoses collected in the emergency, optometry, or ophthalmology departments),3) two abnormal outpatient laboratory results (fasting glucose$126 mg/dL, random or post-challenge [75-g] glucose$200 mg/dL,HbA1c$6.5% [$48 mmol/mol] tested on separate days within a 3-year period), or4) pharmacy use (prescription for insulin or oral antihyperglycemic medications)(9). This algorithm has been compared internally with chart review, and its sensitivity was 96% for identifying patients with diabetes (8). This study, a substudy of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases–funded Diabetes & Aging Study, used KPNC Diabetes Registry data to examine the epidemiology of diabetes across the life course (6,10–13). The study received institutional review board approval from the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute (Oakland, CA) and The University of Chicago (Chicago, IL).The current study is a follow-up to our previous analysis describing associations between 10-year HbA1c trajectories and risk of diabetic complications in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes (6). We Used the same initial cohort, defined as patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes between 1997 and 2003 who had continuous membership in KPNC for at least 2 years before diagnosis and at least 10 years of survival after diagnosis (Supplementary Fig. 1). It was necessary to include patients who survived for at least 10 years to study the effects of various periods of early HbA1c exposure on outcomes. All patients received standard diabetes care from KPNC while enrolled in the health system. We excluded patients with anemia during the study period because of potential inaccuracies of HbA1cin assessing glycemic exposure in these patients (14–16). We Also excluded patients who did not have any HbA1c results during the first 3 months after diagnosis and who did not have a second HbA1c result during the first 2 years after diagnosis because we were unable to classify their levels early HbA1cexposure.In addition,we excluded patients who had missing HbA1c results for more than one-half of the follow-up years after year 3 because patients with frequent missing HbA1c values may have been receiving care outside of Kaiser and may be missing clinical outcome data.Design This study used survival analysis methods to examine associations of various periods of early glycemic exposure and various levels of glycemic exposure with the risks for subsequent diabetic complications and death. Figure 1 define the seven early exposure periods and subsequent follow-up periods. In total,21 Cox proportional hazards models(seven early exposure periods multiplied by three outcomes of interest) were used to analyze these associations. For each outcome, because the seven models differed in the number of years of early glycemic exposure, differences in hazard ratios (HRs) across models reflect additional hazards as a result of longer durations of early HbA1c exposure compared with an HbA1c,6.5% (,48 mmol/mol) for the same duration of exposure.Exposure To explore the effects of various periods of early glycemic exposure, we defined a family of seven early exposure periods(0–1, 0–2, 0–3, 0–4, 0–5, 0–6, and 0–7 years), beginning with 3 months after the first measured HbA1c result (Fig. 1).The mean HbA1c value was calculated for each early exposure period by using all HbA1c results except those measured within 3 months after diagnosis.These initial values were excluded because they reflect control before treatment was initiated, and the glycemic legacy effect has been demonstrated only in populations receiving diabetestreatment.To explore the effects of various levels of glycemic exposure, the mean HbA1c value for each of the seven early exposure periods was categorized into either HbA1c,6.5% (,48 mmol/mol), 6.5% to,7.0% (48 to,53 mmol/mol), 7.0%to,8.0%  (53  to,64  mmol/mol),8.0% to,9.0% (64 to,75 mmol/mol), or$9.0% ($75 mmol/mol) or asmissing if no values were available. All HbA1c assays were conducted at KPNC’centralized laboratory, which is certified by the NGSP (16).Outcomes The outcomes of interest were incident future advanced microvascular events,macrovascular events, and death. Advanced microvascular events included end-stage renal disease, diabetic eye disease, and lower-extremity amputation; macrovascular events included cerebrovascular disease, heart disease,heart failure, and vascular disease.Events were ascertained on the basis of a combination of outpatient, emergency department, or inpatient primary diagnostic or procedure codes(Supplementary Table 1). Advanced diabetic eye disease was identified by diagnostic codes for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema,or blindness/low vision and procedure codes for destruction of a localized retinal lesion, destruction or treatment of extensive/progressive retinopathy, orphotocoagulation. We included only the first occurrence of microvascular and macrovascular events. Mortality data were obtained from the California state mortality file, social security death records, and Kaiser administrative records.Covariates We adjusted for potentially confounding variables. Models adjusted for sex, race/ethnicity, age at diagnosis, and year of diagnosis as well as for cardiovascular risk factors (total and HDL cholesterol,BMI, blood pressure, smoking status),using the last observed value for each of the seven early exposure periods. When there were issues with missing data,the last observation was carried backward. Certain cardiovascular risk factorswere more likely to be missing than other variables, reflecting systematic differences in how variables were collected in clinical practice during the study period. For example, BMI and smoking data were available in only one-half of patients in years 4 and 6 after diabetes diagnosis, respectively, whereas cholesterol and blood pressure data were available in 85% of patients in years 1 and 3 after diabetes diagnosis.In addition, models adjusted for the Charlson comorbidity index (17). We calculated the Charlson comorbidity index using several years of data because of concerns about missing diagnostic codes in the administrative database. The Charlson comorbidity index for the 0-to-1- and 0-to-2-year early exposure periods was calculated using 3 years of data,starting with data from 2 years before diagnosis. For the 0-to-3- and 0-to-4-year early exposure periods, the Charlson comorbidity index was calculated using 5 years of data, starting with data from 2 years before diagnosis, and for the 0-to-5-, 0-to-6-, and 0-to-7-year early exposure periods, it was calculated using data from the first 5 years after diabetes diagnosis.Finally, models adjusted for glycemic exposure after each of the seven early exposure periods. This variable was defined similarly to how glycemic exposure was defined during the early exposure periods. For each patient, the mean HbA1c value was calculated for the time period after each early exposure period and before incidence of the out-come under study for each of the 21 Cox proportional hazards models. These 21 mean values were then categorized as HbA1c,6.5% (,48 mmol/mol), 6.5%to,7.0% (48 to,53 mmol/mol), 7.0%to,8.0% (53 to,64 mmol/mol), 8.0%to,9.0% (64to,75 mmol/mol), or$9.0%($75 mmol/mol).Statistical Analysis We summarized data for patient characteristics using means and SDs for continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables stratified by the 0-to-1-year early exposure period. We used the x2 test for bivariate statistics for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables.In total, 21 Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations between glycemic control for the seven successively longer early exposure periods and risk for subsequent microvascular or macrovascular events or death (Fig. 1). The measure of time was the number of years since diabetes diagnosis.We adjusted for demographics (age at diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity), diagnosis year, cardiovascular risk factors, HbA1c after the early exposure period, and comorbidity. Because we were interested in incident future events, foreach of the seven early exposure periods,we excluded patients who had prevalent(preexisting) microvascular (or macro-vascular) complications during the relevant early exposure period for models examining microvascular (or macrovascular) complications, as appropriate. For example, if a patient had a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease in year 2 after diabetes diagnosis, the patient was included in models that examined the association between the 0- and 1-year early glycemic exposure period and incident future microvascular complications. However, this patient would be excluded from models examining associations between the 0- and 2-year early glycemic exposure period and incident future microvascular complications.For each of the 21 models, patient follow-up was censored after the first occurrence of the outcome of interest,dropout from KPNC (for advanced microvascular and macrovascular events),or end of follow-up (31 December 2013). Overall, 1,732 patients (5.0%)dropped out, and 32,930 (94.8%) were administratively censored at the end of follow-up.Foreachcombinationofsevenearly exposure periods and three outcomes, the time to event or censoring was the number of years from the beginning of the month following the end of the early exposure period to the beginning of the month of the incident outcome.We conducted sensitivity analysis to assess how results changed with other modeling assumptions. Because the models with various early exposure periods had different follow-up periods,which may affect results, we conducted a sensitivity analysis for the microvascular and macrovascular outcomes in which we right censored patient follow-up at 5 years of follow-up. A two-sided P,0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. Analyses were completed using SAS 9.4 statistical software(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).RESULTS Overall, 34,737 eligible patients were included in the study. Mean follow-up after diagnosis was 13.0 years (SD 1.9years) (Table 1). The mean age at diagnosis was 56.8 years (SD 11.0 years).During the 1st year after diagnosis (0-to-1-year early glycemic exposure period),41.1% (n= 14,286) of patients had an average HbA1c,6.5% (,48 mmol/mol),16.9% (n= 5,877) had an average HbA1c6.5% to,7.0% (48 to,53 mmol/mol),13.6% (n= 4,730) had an average HbA1c7.0% to,8.0% (53 to,64 mmol/mol),4.1% (n= 1,418) had an average HbA1c8.0% to,9.0% (64 to,75 mmol/mol),3.7% (n= 1,290) had an average HbA1c$9.0% ($75 mmol/mol), and 20.5%(n= 7,136) did not have a second HbA1c value. Patients who had a mean HbA1c,6.5% (,48 mmol/mol) in the 0-to-1-year early exposure period were older,more likely to be non-Hispanic white,and less likely to be current smokers and had a lower BMI and total cholesterol than those with higher mean HbA1c levels. In addition, they were less likely to be taking both metformin and sulfonylureas during their 1st year after diagnosis. During the first 7 years after diabetes diagnosis, only 4.9% of patients had the same HbA1c level for each of the 7 years; 50.4% of patients had.1 year with a higher HbA1c level, and 30.4% of patients had.1 year with a lower HbA1c level; 14.3% of patients had years with both higher and lower HbA1c levels.Overall, chronic kidney disease stage 4 or 5 was present in only 53 patients.Microvascular and Macrovascular Events Figure 2 A and B depicts HRs comparing microvascular and macrovascular events rates for the various HbA1c early exposure periods and levels, compared with an HbA1c,6.5% (,48 mmol/mol) for the same early exposure periods. With regard to our hypothesis that the legacy effect begins the 1st year after diagnosis, we found that patients with HbA1c levels$6.5% ($48 mmol/mol) for the 0-to-1-year early exposure period had a higher risk for microvascular and macrovascular events than patients with HbA1c levels,6.5% (,48 mmol/mol) for the same period (e.g., HbA1c6.5% to,7.0%[48 to,53 mmol/mol]: HR 1.204 [95% CI1.063–1.365]) (Table 2).With regard to our hypothesis that the legacy effect depends on the level of glycemic exposure, we found that longer periods of early glycemic exposure at HbA1c levels 6.5% to,8.0%(48 to,64 mmol/mol) did not increase the risk of microvascular or macrovascular events during follow-up. However,longer periods of exposure to HbA1c levels$8.0% ($64 mmol/mol) were associated with an increasing risk of microvascular events. HbA1c levels$9.0% ($75 mmol/mol) for early exposure periods.0–4 years were associated with an increasing risk of macrovascular events.Mortality Figure 2 C presents the risks of mortality for various durations and levels of early glycemic exposure compared with an HbA1c,6.5% (,48 mmol/mol) for the same durations of exposure. Compared with an HbA1c,6.5% (,48 mmol/mol)for the 0-to-1-year early exposure period, HbA1c levels of 7.0% to,8.0%(53 to,64 mmol/mol) and$9.0%($75 mmol/mol) were associated with a higher risk of mortality (HR1.290 [95% CI 1.104–1.507] and 1.320[1.017–1.713], respectively). HbA1c8.0%to,9.0% (64 to,75 mmol/mol) for the 0-to-2-year early exposure period was associated with a greater risk of mortality(1.240 [1.088–1.414]) compared with an HbA1c,6.5% (,48 mmol/mol) for the same early exposure period. For all early exposure periods, HbA1c6.5% to,7.0%(48 to,53 mmol/mol) was not associated with a higher risk of mortality during follow-up.Longer early exposure periods with HbA1c levels,8.0% (,53 mmol/mol)were not associated with increases in mortality risk. However, longer early exposure periods with HbA1c levels$8.0%($53 mmol/mol) were associated with increasing mortality risk.Early Missing HbA1c During the 1st year after diagnosis (0-to-1-year early exposure period), patients without an HbA1c value after the first 3 months after diagnosis had a higher risk of microvascular (HR 1.354 [95% CI 1.218–1.505]) and macrovascular (1.112[1.050–1.177]) events and mortality(1.235 [1.094–1.394]) (Table 2).Sensitivity Analysis When follow-up time was right censored at 5 years, relationships between the duration and intensity of early glycemic exposure and microvascular and macrovascular events did not change(Supplementary Fig. 2).CONCLUSIONS In this large cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and at least 10 years of survival after diagnosis, we found that diabetes control during the1st year after diagnosis was strongly associated with future risk for diabetic complications and mortality, even after adjusting for glycemic control after the1st year. Overall, the duration and intensity of early glycemic control were both closely aligned with outcomes.Compared  with  an  HbA1c,6.5%(,48 mmol/mol) for the 1st year after diagnosis, higher HbA1c levels were associated with a higher risk for microvascular and macrovascular events, and HbA1c levels$7.0% ($58 mmol/mol)were associated with a higher risk for mortality. The risk of complications did not increase significantly when the early period was characterized by longer periods of HbA1c levels of 6.5% to,8.0%(48 to,64 mmol/mol) (rather than just the 1st year after diabetes diagnosis).However, longer exposure to HbA1c levels$8.0% ($64 mmol/mol) was associated with an increased risk for macrovascular events and mortality.The current study suggests that failure to achieve an HbA1c,6.5% (,48 mmol/mol) within the 1st year after diabetes diagnosis is sufficient to establish an ir-remediable long-term future risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. In addition, failure to achieve an HbA1c,7.0% (,53 mmol/mol) within the 1st year after diabetes diagnosis may lead to an irreversible increased risk of mortality. These findings are supported by previous cohort studies that showed that failure to intensify diabetes treatments in patients with elevated HbA1c values is associated with increased retinopathy and cardiovascular events(18,19).Longer periods of early exposure to amean HbA1c,8.0% (,64 mmol/mol) in the current study were not associated with an increased risk of complications;however, lower periods of early exposure to an HbA1c$8.0% ($64 mmol/mol)were associated with an increased future risk of microvascular events and mortality. The interaction between the duration and intensity of glycemic exposure and outcomes aligns with the pathophysiologic understanding of the glycemic legacy effect and patient outcomes from the DCCT and UKPDS. In cellular and animal models, persistent harm associated with historical hyperglycemia has been attributed to mitochondrial superoxide overproduction, leading to increased advanced glycation end products, activation of protein kinase C, fructose production, and increased flux through the hexosamine pathway (20,21). In the DCCT, patients with elevated levels of advanced glycation end products had higher rates of microvascular complications (22). Furthermore, patients randomized to early intensive glycemic control in the UKPDS and DCCT had a legacy of benefits that lasted 10 and 25 additional years, respectively(1,4).The current results suggest that the patient’s lifetime history of glycemic control may be necessary to understand why patients with longstanding diabetes develop complications despite excellent control later in the course of their dis-ease. The association between the first years of glycemic control and outcomes also should be considered when formulating public health and healthcare policy regarding the intensity of efforts to control hyperglycemia to improve diabetes outcomes for patients with longstanding diabetes. Young (ages 18–39 years) and middle-aged adults (ages 40–64 years),however, have been found to have substantially higher glycemic levels than older adults (23), which is a missed opportunity; treating patients with diabetes earlier and more intensively has the potential to confer substantial, long-term improvements in public health. Our Finding of a relationship between missing data in the 1st year being predictive of future events also suggests the value for aggressive follow-up or educational efforts for patients who do not use offered services. Thus, public health and healthcare policy should put a greater emphasis achieving early glycemic control as an avenue for improving lifetime outcomes for patients with diabetes.This study has several strengths and limitations. Because we studied only patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and at least 10 years of survival, the results are not generalizable to patients with established diabetes or to those with a high risk of mortality after diabetes diagnosis. It is possible that patients with established diabetes may benefit from HbA1c,6.5% (,48 mmol/mol) control,but the benefits may take decades to become evident, and patients may die as a result of non diabetes-related causes in the meantime. For example, in the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT), which randomized patients with established diabetes (mean 11.5 years) to intensive glycemic control or standard therapy(median HbA1c6.9% [52 mmol/mol]vs. 8.4% [68 mmol/mol]) for 5.6 years,reductions in major cardiovascular events were detected only after 10 years of total follow-up (24). A long-term follow-up cohort study in a non clinical trial population will be necessary to explore the effects of early versus later glycemic exposure in patients with established diabetes. In addition, the observed patterns between glycemic exposure and clinical outcomes may differ if we used other thresholds for defining glycemic exposure. The current study questions required a long follow-up, during which important secular changes in diabetes screening, (25) intensity of glycemic control (26), and outcomes (27) may have affected our findings. Although we adjusted for year of diagnosis to address issues with secular trends, residual confounding may still be present.The study population was a managed care population from northern California, and this population is notable for its location, ethnic diversity, and sociodemographics. However, of note, 90% of patients with diabetes have health insurance (28), and KPNC cares for patients with a full range of insurance. In addition, because patients in KPNC are all offered uniform access to care within an integrated healthcare delivery system,confounding as a result of differential access to care is less of an issue by using KPNC data. Because this epidemiologic study includes all patients in KPNC with diabetes who survived 10 years after diagnosis, the predictor-outcome relationships that we identified should be widely generalizable, even if the distributions of HbA1c exposure observed in this population may not apply to other settings. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that quality of care at KPNC is comparable to other large health care delivery systems across the U.S.. (29).A major limitation is the inability to comment on causality. It is possible that HbA1c at the time of diagnosis reflect inherent differences in baseline disease severity or patient characteristics that determine long-term outcomes. Furthermore, we relied on historical administrative databases to gather outcome data rather than a clinical adjudication of endpoints. Although there can be misclassification, we do not anticipate bias as a result of coding of events because that misclassification would unlikely differ systematically by timing, duration, and degree of glycemic exposure. We were unable to study the effect of aspirin,behavioral factors, or cause of death because these are not well documented in medical records, which may have led to an overestimation of the relationships between early HbA1c exposure and outcomes. We also did not analyze the effects of prescription medications because in the relationship between glycemic exposure and diabetic complications and mortality, medications can be time-dependent confounders, and using alternative modeling methods that address time-dependent confounding would preclude isolating the effects of specific early periods. Subsequent studies are necessary to explore how medications may moderate the legacy effectover time.In conclusion, among patients with 10 years of survival after diabetes diagnosis, we found that HbA1c levels$6.5% ($48 mmol/mol) for the 1st years after diagnosis was associated with a greater risk of future diabetic complications compared with an HbA1c,6.5%for the 1st year after diagnosis. HbA1c levels$7.0% ($53 mmol/mol) for the1st year after diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of future mortality.Increasing periods of exposure to HbA1c levels$8.0% ($64 mmol/mol) were associated with an increased risk of microvascular events and mortality. This study suggests that the legacy effect exists outside of trial populations, begins as early as the 1st year after diagnosis,and depends on the level of glycemic exposure. These Findings underscore the urgency of early diagnosis of diabetes and the future consequences of failing to achieve near-normal glycemia soon after patients are diagnosed with diabetes.

Does a mandibular overdenture improve nutrient intake and markers of nutritional status better than conventional complete denture? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Toru Yamazaki, Alexandra LC Martiniuk, Koichiro Irie, Shigeru Sokejima, Crystal Man Ying Lee","ABSTRACT Objectives:The need for denture treatment in public health will increase as the population ages. However,the impact of dentures on nutrition, particularly overdenture treatment, remains unclear although the physical and psychological effects are known. We investigated whether treatment with a mandibular implant supported overdenture improves nutrient intake and markers of nutritional status better than a conventional complete denture in edentulouspatients.Design:Systematic review and meta-analysis.Methods:Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for eligible studies published up to April 2016. We included studies which compared the treatment effect of an overdenture to conventional denture on nutrition, in which primary outcomes included changes in intake of macronutrients and/or micronutrients and/or indicators of nutritional status. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible studies and assessed the risk of bias.We used a fixed effects model to estimate the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI for change in body mass index (BMI), albumin and serum vitamin B12 between overdenture and conventional denture 6 months after treatment.Results:Of 108 eligible studies, 8 studies involving 901 participants were included in the narrative appraisal. Four studies reported changes in markers of nutritional status and nutrient intake after treatment with a prosthetic, regardless of type. In a meta-analysis of 322 participants aged 65 years or older from three studies, pooled analysis suggested no significant difference in change in BMI between an overdenture and conventional denture 6 months after treatment(WMD=−0.18 kg/m2(95% CI−0.52 to 0.16)), and no significant difference in change in albumin or vitamin B12 between the two treatments.Conclusions:The modifying effect of overdenture treatment on nutritional status might be limited. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficacy of denture treatments. Strengths and limitations of this study▪This is the first meta-analysis of the treatment effect of a mandibular implant supported overdenture compared with a conventional denture on nutritional status in edentulous patients.▪This study has several limitations: small sample size, short follow-up period, target population and limited outcomes for nutrient intake or nutritional status in the included studies.▪However, our narrative appraisal and quantitative analysis indicate important strategies for further studies of denture treatment on malnutrition.","INTRODUCTION Nutrition is an important determinant of health, including immune function, cognitive function and mortality in the older population.1 The prevalence of malnutrition is increasing in this population, and a recent survey reported that as many as 46.2% of older adults were classified as at risk of malnutrition.2 The incidence of malnutrition is influenced by multiple biological, physiological and pathological factors, including dental status.1 Several observational studies have shown that intakes of nutritious foods,macronutrients  and  micronutrients,  and nutritional status were lower in those who were unable to fully masticate due to tooth loss, ill fitting dentures or edentulousness.3–8 The prevalence of edentulousness is still high in some countries.I9ndeed, a survey from the WHO showed that as many as 78%of adults aged 65 years or older were edentulous.9 For the elderly edentulous, a conventional  complete  denture  is  effective  for improving masticatory performance, appear-ance, and the ability to engage in social and interpersonal  activities.10 Moreover,  many studies  report  that  prosthetic  treatments  modified dietary  patterns  and  improved  the  variety of  food intake.11–16 As adults aged 60 years or older may exceed more than 20% of the total population worldwide by 2050,17the need for conventional denture treatment in public health will increase as the population ages.Nevertheless,  a  default  treatment  for  edentulous,namely a mandibular denture, sometimes loses stability and retention.18The lack of stability and retention of the denture would lead to pain in eating, concerns about aesthetics and the negative impact of dentures in social situations. The mandibular implant supported overdenture, a removable prosthetic device that overlies and is supported by retained implants, was developed to solve these problems. Although the current cost of an overdenture is estimated to be 1.6–1.8 times higher than a conventional denture,18 treatment time does not differ much. Several studies have demonstrated the superiority  of  an  overdenture  over  a  conventional denture for both physical and psychological factors,including masticatory performance, denture stability,food  avoidance  and  oral  health  related  quality  of life.12–15 19 Given that the psychosocial factors of dentures are considered to be as important as masticatory performance  in  determining  food  choice,20 the results indicate that treatment with an implant supported overdenture will encourage the intake of more kinds  of  foods  than  a  conventional  denture  and thereby contribute to the improvement of nutritional status, albeit at some expense.A number of studies reported that markers of nutritional status, such as the Mini Nutritional Assessment(MNA) and albumin, or intake of nutrients such as vitamin B12 and vitamin E, differed following overdenture   treatment   compared   with   conventional denture.13 15 19 In contrast, other studies showed no difference between overdenture and conventional dentures in their effect on markers of nutritional status or nutrient intake.12 21–23 This inconsistency is exacerbated by the small sample sizes in some of these studies, which prevented assessment of the clinical effectiveness of overdenture treatment. Thus the effect of overdenture treatment on nutrition remains unclear.Here we conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to investigate whether overdenture treatment provides greater improvement in nutrient intake and markers of nutritional status than treatment with conventional denture in edentulous patients.METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews And Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement.24 Our research question for this review was“Does treatment with a mandibular implant supported overdenture provide better improvement than a conventional denture in nutrient intake (macronutrients and micronutrients) or markers for nutritional status (body mass index (BMI), MNA andalbumin) in edentulous patients?”We searched Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for eligible studies. Medline was searched for papers published between 1946 and April 2016; EMBASE for those published between 1974 and April 2016; and CENTRAL for those published in issue 4, 2016. The search strategies foreach database were constructed based on our primary outcomes  and  are  shown  in  online  supplementary appendix S1. We did not set a language restriction in the search.We set the following eligibility criteria for literature screening: human subjects, with the study design of either a randomised control trial (RCT), cohort study or case control study. To be eligible, the intervention or exposure had to include a prosthetic treatment, such asa denture. Primary outcomes included change in intake of macronutrients (ie, proteins, fats and carbohydrates)and/or micronutrients (eg, vitamins and calcium) and/or indicators for nutritional status. To assess nutritional status, we used BMI, MNA and albumin as marker because these are considered to be screening tools for malnutrition or nutritional markers.1We additionally investigated the following efficacy of dentures as secondary  outcomes:  change  in  masticatory  performance,denture stability, oral health related quality of life our food choice.Two reviewers (TY and KI) independently screened titles and abstracts for eligible studies. Inter-examiner reliability was 0.73 byκstatistics. Full text articles were obtained for further screening if the information in the abstract met the eligibility criteria or if the abstract was not available. Studies were included in this review if a target prosthetic treatment was clearly stated; comparison of prosthetic treatments (ie, overdenture vs conventional denture) was adequately conducted; and the change in macronutrient intake, micronutrient intake and/or markers of nutritional status were evaluated between treatment groups. Studies were excluded if they examined reverse causation in the association between dental and nutritional status or if findings were only reported in a poster, guideline, letter or protocol.Disagreements  over  the  eligibility  of  a  study  were resolved by discussion between the reviewers.One reviewer extracted data from included studies and  the  second  reviewer  checked  the  data.  The Extracted data were as follows: study design, setting,inclusion criteria, principal health problem in the participants, other health problems, number of interventions/exposure   participants   and   non-completers,number of control participants and non-completers,treatment received, outcomes measured and assessment method, and follow-up period. If the included study did not  report  the  variability  of  quantitative  estimates required for meta-analysis—that is, SD, SE or 95% CIs for  an  outcome—we  contacted  the  corresponding author for additional information by email. Two reviewers (TY and KI) assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane collaboration’stool.25This tool consists of seven domains for the risk of bias—random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and study staff, blinding of  outcome  assessment,  incomplete  outcome  data,selective reporting and other sources of bias. As this assessment tool is designed for RCTs and controlled before and after studies,25we used it to assess the risk of bias for controlled studies. We also took account of other sources of bias. The reviewers independently assigned  a  judgement  of‘low  risk’,‘high  risk’or‘unclear risk’of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between the reviewers.Statistical analysis The weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI for change in BMI between overdentures and conventional dentures 6 months after treatment were estimated using fixed effects model, on the basis that the included studies were similar in study design, participants, type of treatment received, outcome measured and length of follow-up.  The  analysis  was  repeated  separately  for change  in  albumin  and  change  in  vitamin  B12.Heterogeneity between studies was tested by the I2 Statistics.26 All statistical analyses were performed using StataV.11.2  software  (Stata  Corporation,  College  Station,Texas, USA). RESULTS Screening and selection A flow diagram of the screening and selection of studies is shown in figure 1. The Medline, EMBASE and CENTRAL  searches  identified  1004  studies.  After removal of duplicates, 776 studies were screened by title and abstract. Of these, 108 articles were retrieved to assess eligibility, of which 100 were removed based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, leaving 8 studies for inclusion in the narrative appraisal. Of these eight studies, Moraisetal 15 reported the SD or 95% CI of mean differences between baseline and follow-up in each group. Upon request, Mülleretal,19Hamdanetal,21 Awadetal 13 and Gjengedaletal 12 Provided additional information on the outcomes for this review.However,  the  outcome  measures  (anthropometric,macronutrient or micronutrient data) and assessment method  (objective  or  subjective)  differed  between studies, and only three studies were therefore included in the meta-analysis.Characteristics of the included studies Six RCTs 12  13  15  19  21  23 and two prospective cohort study 22 27 investigated changes in nutrient intake and/or markers of nutritional status by interventional mandibular implant  supported  overdenture  treatment  (table  1).A total of 901 participants were included in this review.Five studies had a sample size of <100 participants and only  three  studies  included  over  100  participants(table 2).13 21 23 All studies were conducted in a hospital.One study focused on participants with diabetes.23 Primary outcome We divided outcome measures into three groups: macronutrient intake, micronutrient intake and markers of nutritional status (table 3).Macronutrient intakes Intakes of protein, total, saturated or unsaturated fat,and carbohydrate were measured as indicators of macronutrients. Four studies assessed a change in protein intake 12 21 23 27 but found no significant differences in protein intake within or between groups, regardless of treatment type. In contrast, one study reported significant decreases in total fat after overdenture and conventional  denture  treatments  (−1.5%  energy  in  the overdenture group and−4.6% in the conventional denture group at 12 months).27 However, no differences were found between the groups. Three other studies found no significant difference in total, saturated or unsaturated fat within or between groups.12 21 23 For  carbohydrates,  one  study  with  follow-up  at 12 months or more found a significant increase in percentage contribution to energy intake by 1.2% in the overdenture group and 5.3% in the conventional denture group.27 In contrast, three other studies found no significant difference within or between groups.12 21 23 Micronutrient intake Many different micronutrients were measured in the included studies. Here we focused on calcium, dietaryfibre, magnesium and vitamins as indicators of micronutrients because some observational studies reported that these micronutrients were lower in those who were unable to fully masticate due to teeth loss, ill fitting dentures or edentulousness.36–8 With regard to micronutrient intakes measured by interview, questionnaire or both, none of the five studies found any differences in macronutrient intake within or between groups.12 21–23 27 Markers of nutritional status Four studies assessed a change or difference in BMI as an indicator of nutritional status. Of these studies, one RCT with follow-up at 12 months reported a 0.41 kg/m2 decrease in BMI for both the overdenture and conventional denture groups using a linear mixed effects regression model, allowing for repeated measures and potential  confounders.19In  contrast,  three  studies showed no significant change or difference in BMI between groups at the 12 month follow-up.13 15 22 One study evaluated a change in MNA as an indicator of nutritional status after prosthetic treatment but the result showed no significant change after treatment within or between groups.19One study with follow-up at 6 and 12 months reported significant decreases in serum vitamin B6 in the overdenture and conventional denture groups.13In contrast,one study with follow-up at 6 months showed an increase in serum vitamin B12 of 27.6 pmol/L and an increase in albumin of 1.1 g/L in the overdenture group.15 Assessment methods of macronutrients or micronutrients Intakes  of  macronutrients  or  micronutrients  were assessed using multiple pass 24 hour dietary recall by telephone interview or by a prospective food diary with dietician or technician follow-up. All dietary recalls were conducted by trained personnel using a structured template. Three studies reported that nutrient data were calculated from the collected information using validated computer programmes,12 21 23 but one study did not show the calculation method.27 Secondary outcome Of the eight included studies,five examined the efficacy of an overdenture as a secondary endpoint. One study reported that overdenture treatment increased denture satisfaction (DS-VAS), oral health related quality of life(Oral Health Impact Profile-EDENT), maximum voluntary bite force and denture stability compared with conventional denture treatment.19 All four studies which investigated changes in food choice after intervention showed that overdenture treatment offered more choice of food items such as beef or whole fruit.12 13 15 22 Risk of bias Online supplementary appendix S2 summarises the risk of bias in the included studies. All six RCTs reported an adequate method of random sequence generation. Of these,  one  study  reported  allocation  concealment 19 while the rest either did not report it or did not conduct it appropriately. For objective measurements, we considered that blinding of assessors was appropriately con-ducted. However, for questionnaires or interviews in nutritional  assessment,  most  studies  did  not  clarify whether the assessors were subject to blinding. Three studies reported methods for dealing with incomplete outcome data 13 19 21 but three studies did not explain how this was dealt with. With regard to selective reporting, some studies did not sufficiently report baseline data or outcomes of interest.12 Meta-analysis Three RCTs provided information on BMI, albumin and serum vitamin B12 required for data pooling. Moreover,subject  characteristics  of  these  three  studies  were similar,13 15 19 allowing us to conduct meta-analysis for the three outcome measures. Although Mülleretal19provided data for 3, 6 and 12 months, and Awadetal13 Provided data for 6 and 12 months, we restricted analysis to data at 6 months’follow-up, which included the studyby Moraisetal.15A total of 322 participants were included. Results showed no significant difference in change in BMI between an overdenture and conventional denture (WMD=−0.18 kg/m2; 95% CI−0.52 to0.16;  p=0.44)  (figure  2).  Similarly,  there  was  no significant difference in change in albumin (WMD=−0.23 g/L; 95% CI−0.79 to 0.34; p=0.73) (figure 2)or vitamin B12 (WMD=−11.16 pmol/L; 95% CI−30.43 to 8.12; p=0.43) (online supplementary appendix S3). No heterogeneity was observed between studies (I2=0%).Publication bias was not tested since fewer than five studies were included.DISCUSSION We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether treatment with an implant supported overdenture improves nutrient intake and nutritional status compared with a conventional denture in edentulous  patients.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the first meta-analysis of the treatment effect of overdenture on nutritional status. A narrative appraisal suggested that some markers of nutritional status and intake of nutrients changed after treatment, regardless of prosthetic treatment type. However, we found no report of significant differences  in  nutrient  intake  or  nutritional  markers between treatments. Similarly, our meta-analysis showed no significant change in nutritional status between the two treatments at 6 months after treatment among an older  population.  Although  our hypothesis  was  not proven, our review and analysis indicate important strategies for further studies on malnutrition treatment.Our hypothesis was that overdenture treatment facilitates the intake of a variety of foods, which in turn leads to  better  nutritional  status  than  with  conventional denture treatment. In particular, the increased consumption of meat facilitated by an overdenture might lead to an increase in serum vitamin B12.28 However,our narrative appraisal and quantitative analysis showed no evidence  of a difference in nutritional  changes between these treatments. Rather, our pooled estimates suggested that the treatment effect on nutrient intake was opposite to the expected direction; namely, conventional denture treatment might have been associated with slightly more favourable levels of albumin and vitamin B12 than overdenture treatment.We speculate that overdenture treatment had less or no effect on nutritional status compared with a conventional denture for the following three reasons. First, the modifying  effect  offered  by  the  treatment  may  be limited because all enrolled participants were aged 65 years or older; in other words, eating patterns and nutritional status might be more strongly impacted by declines in biological, physiological and sensory function with aging than by prosthetic treatments.129 Second, a 6 month follow-up period may not be long enough for longer term users of conventional dentures to adapt to the new overdenture treatment. More specifically, learning new motor skills or adapting existing motor patterns requires neuroplasticity, particularly in older persons,30 and the modification of eating patterns by overdenture treatment in our older participants might not have been sufficient to produce a measurable change in nutritional status in the short term. Finally, prosthetic rehabilitation alone may not have the effect of exerting a change in nutritional status. Since nutritional inadequacy in older persons can result from multiple factors—physiological,pathological, sociological, and psychological 131—older populations may require a multidisciplinary approach to improving nutritional status. To prevent and treat malnutrition in older persons, the Nutrition and Dietetics Guideline recommends, based on high level evidence,that food provision methods be modified or feeding support be provided by healthcare assistants.32 Given That our narrative appraisal and other systematic review showed that denture stability, denture satisfaction on food choice were improved by overdenture treatment compared with a conventional denture,12 13 15 18 19 22 prosthetic approach in combination with these interventions might support an improvement in nutritional status among older adults at risk of malnutrition.A mandibular two implant supported overdenture costs more than a conventional denture. According to an RCT that investigated the cost effectiveness of oral health related quality of life,33 the equalised annual costs were estimated at 625 Canadian dollars for an overdenture versus 399 dollars for a conventional denture,with the inclusion of aftercare. Another RCT estimated that the mean direct cost of overdenture treatment was 2332 Canadian dollars, or 2.4 times higher than conventional denture treatment.34As the two treatments have similar time and cost requirements,35 the utility of overdenture treatment might be limited with regard to nutrition improvement.Several limitations of this study warrant mention. First,we could not assess the impact of treatment on those who require nutritional therapy due to malnutrition,since the participants were likely to have been generally healthier than individuals in hospitals or healthcare institutions.1 Considering that many older adults are classified as at risk of malnutrition,2 generalisation of our results requires further study into the effects of prosthetic treatments on nutrition among an at risk population. Second, our use of BMI, albumin and serum vitamin B12 only as outcome measures might not have provided a full evaluation of nutritional status. It is true that BMI predicts disease risk in those who are underweight or obese, but measurement in older adults can be confounded by a loss of height caused by vertebral collapse or a change in posture caused by loss of muscle tone.1 Measurement can be further confounded by the presence of ascites and oedema.1 Moreover, the direction of a change in BMI can be either a positive or negative outcome, depending on the baseline characteristics of the individual participant, and pooled data can be difficult to interpret. Instead, measurement of skinfold thickness and muscular circumference of the arm would provide a better anthropometric assessment of nutritional status, although our review found that only a few studies investigated these indicators.1 Similarly, serum albumin can predict mortality in older people but is influenced by other factors such as inflammation and infection.1 In contrast, transferrin, saturated/unsaturated serum cholesterol and trace elements are more sensitive indicators of malnutrition.1Future studies of the effect of prosthetic treatment on nutrition in older populations should therefore use these sensitive marker for anthropometric assessment of nutritional status inplace of BMI and albumin.Third, the quality of the included studies varied.Random sequence generation was adequately conducted in all RCTs but five of the studies did not report or conduct    allocation    concealment    appropriately.Furthermore, most studies did not provide sufficient statistical consideration for incomplete data, or intention to treat analysis and statistical multiplicity. These issues might have led to the overestimation of treatment effect in these studies. Finally, since only three studies were included in the meta-analysis, the small sample size might not have been adequate for precise estimation of the pooled effect size and might have limited the generalisation of the study. In addition, we could not assess the possibility of publication bias due to the limited number of studies pooled.CONCLUSIONS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of implant supported overdenture treatment on nutrient  intake  and  nutritional  status  in  edentulous patients. The narrative appraisal and meta-analysis demonstrated that, compared with conventional denture treatment, overdenture treatment did not have a greater effect on changes in BMI, albumin or vitamin B12 6 months after treatment among the older population. Considering Cost effectiveness, the utility of overdenture treatment might be limited with regard to nutrition improvement.However, these present and previous results indicate that a multidisciplinary approach which includes overdenture treatment might support an improvement in nutritional status among older adults. Further intervention trials or observational studies are needed to evaluate the long term effectiveness and efficacy of denture treatments on nutrition in the wider population. ",-,"1.

Epigenetics and Immunometabolism in Diabetes and Aging,Tomasz J. Guzik and Francesco Cosentino,"Abstract Significance:A strong relationship between hyperglycemia, impaired insulin pathway, and cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is linked to oxidative stress and inflammation. Immunometabolic pathways linkthese pathogenic processes and pose important potential therapeutic targets.Recent Advances:The link between immunity and metabolism is bidirectional and includes the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders such as T2D, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension and the role of metabolic factors in regulation of immune cell functions. Low-grade inflammation,oxidative stress, balance between superoxide and nitric oxide, and the infiltration of macrophages, T cells, andB cells in insulin-sensitive tissues lead to metabolic impairment and accelerated aging.Critical Issues:Inflammatory infiltrate and altered immune cell phenotype precede development of metabolic disorders. Inflammatory changes are tightly linked to alterations in metabolic status and energy expenditure andare controlled by epigenetic mechanisms.Future Directions:A better comprehension of these mechanistic insights is of utmost importance to identify novel molecular targets. In this study, we describe a complex scenario of epigenetic changes and immunometabolism linking to diabetes and aging-associated vascular disease.Antioxid. Redox Signal.29, 257–274. Keywords:vascular, inflammation, epigenetics, nitric oxide, superoxide, diabetes","Introduction The prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D)mellitus is alarmingly increasing worldwide (12, 71).The International Diabetes Federation currently estimates that 415 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus worldwide and anticipate an increase up to 640 million by the year 2040 (1). The main determinants of this increase are represented by modifiable (sedentary lifestyle and dietary habits) and nonmodifiable factors (genetic predisposition and aging; 119). T2D is associated with increased risk of micro- and macrovascular complications and approximately twofold greater mortality when compared with the general population (71). Advances in therapy have reduced T2D morbidity and mortality. However, cardiovascular risk is far to be eradicated, and mechanism-based therapeutic approaches are needed (42). In patients with T2D, high glucose levels trigger endothelial inflammation,mitochondrial oxidative stress, and reduced availability of nitric oxide (NO), all contributing to cardiovascular complications. One of the key predictive factors related to micro-and macroangiopathy is associated with accelerated vascular aging resulting in atherosclerosis and microvascular dysfunction (9, 144). Low-grade inflammation has been established as one of the key mechanisms linking these conditions(51, 97, 98, 113, 138). Therefore, T2D is a prime example of an interplay between metabolism and immunity, making it prototypic for an in-depth look into immunometabolism.It has been known since the 1980s that insulin and insulin receptors modulate immunity (64). At the same time, ow-grade inflammation and the infiltration of immune cells into insulin-sensitive tissues lead to metabolic impairment and accelerated aging (145). Perivascular and adipose tissue(AT) inflammatory infiltrate, and altered immune cell phenotype, can precede the development of metabolic disorders,including obesity, insulin resistance, T2D, atherosclerosis(129, 150), or hypertension (102). Moreover, specific ablation of macrophages, B cells, or T cells from the AT can not only restore metabolic function but also prevent development of related pathologies (51, 145). Clinical significance is emphasized by the prognostic value of C-reactive protein levels or plasma cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a; 74), although ongoing clinical trials will give us strong insight soon. Better understanding of immuno metabolic diseases may lead to the development of novel immune targeted therapies in the treatment and prevention of metabolic dysfunction in hypertension, diabetes, andaging.Epigenetic mechanisms that control immune cell lineage determination, function, and migration are implicated (132,149) and can provide valuable therapeutic targets in the future.Epigenetic modifications are emerging as key players in the setting of this pathogenetic chain of events (61). Acetylation and methylation at DNA/histone complexes significantly alters gene expression by modulating chromatin accessibility (21).Accelerated Vascular Aging in Diabetes Accelerated vascular aging is characterized by progressive pathological vascular remodeling, dependent on vascular fibrosis and calcification, leading to vascular stiffening as a clinical manifestation and is particularly prevalent in T2D (Fig. 1) (172).It bears important prognostic significance (40). Extracellular matrix remodeling is initiated by risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes and is mediated by endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation (28). Factors affecting collagen deposition and matrix degradation are linked to pathologic vascular remodeling also in the context of inflammation (25, 92). MMP9(metalloproteinase 9) is, for example, essential for driving macrophage-dependent inflammation in the context of aging(92), although the cause–effect relationship between matrix remodeling factors and cardiovascular outcomes remains poorly defined (31), and may indicate other important regulators. Telomere shortening is one of the features of accelerated vascular aging. Indeed, vascular telomere length is lower in T2D patients(162). This is also important asa recent cross-sectional study demonstrated that telomere length is independently associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in subjects with T2D (152).However, accelerated telomere attrition was recently reported in circulating leukocytes, but not arteries, in T2D compared to control rats (156). This indicates the importance of immune senescence in diabetic vascular dysfunction/aging pathogenesis and that leukocytes may be primary targets of accelerated aging.Immunometabolism: Basic Concepts The relationship between immunity and metabolism is bidirectional and includes (i) the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension and (ii) the role of metabolic factors in regulation of immune cell functions(132). The latter encompasses the effects of metabolic state of the environment on inflammation and the metabolic processes within the immune cells that regulate immunity (112).It has been well recognized that metabolic state of environment may affect the development of inflammation (11,87) particularly by affecting substrates available and also bychanging chemokine gradients and local cytokine production. Overabundance of substrates observed in obesity and metabolic syndrome affects the phenotype of both infiltrating and resident immune cells (145). This has been strongly demonstrated in relation to macrophage phenotype switching between M1 and M2 (190). Macrophages More importantly, however, immune responses are accompanied by a dramatic metabolic switch within the immune cells themselves (145). For example, interferon gamma (IFN-c)-activated (M1 type) macrophages rapidly shift to anaerobic glycolysis, while M2-type macrophages rely on oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 2). This has been first identified nearly five decades ago in studies of peritoneal macrophages demonstrating their increased glycolysis and decreased oxygen consumption on activation (62).T  cells Similar metabolic switches are related to adaptive T cell responses. Naive and quiescent T cells rely on glucose and fatty acid metabolism for energy, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, linked to the generation of adenosine triphosphate(ATP)via oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 2; Table 1; 36, 125).When antigen is presented during immune challenge, T lymphocytes engage pathways of anabolic metabolism, switching to aerobic glycolysis (regulated greatly by mechanistic target of rapamycin or mTOR), to support clonal expansion and the development of effector functions (Fig. 2; Table 1; 107).T regulatory cells (Treg) are, in turn, dependent on oxidative phosphorylation and lipid peroxidation (93, 101). T cell activation is associated with transient activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a sensor of cellular energy levels,which allows the cells to prepare for high-energy consuming processes that follow T cell receptor activation (157).Glucose  metabolism  and  immune  activation The metabolic changes within the T cell during activation are modulated by environmental factors, such as insulin,which promotes T cell activation (64). Classical T cell activation is accompanied by upregulation of the insulin receptor, with subsequent increase in Glut1, Glut3, and Glut4, as well as an upregulation of glycolytic enzymes (37). These events are required for efficient adaptive immunity. Silencing the insulin receptor impairs T cell functions related to glucose transport and glycolysis, including polyclonal activation of CD4+T cells, effector cytokine (Th1 type—IFN-cand TNF and Th17 type—IL-17) production, migration, and proliferation (37). This was associated with alterations in intracellular signaling pathways, including RAS/ERK, PI3K/AKT,and mTOR pathways (37). The cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells in response to alloantigens is also dependent on insulin receptor (37). Moreover, recent evidence suggests that regulatory T cells (Tregs) express the insulin receptor, and that high levels of insulin impair the ability of Tregs to suppress inflammatory response via effects on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway (60). The effect of insulin on Treg suppression is limited to IL-10 production and does not alter other suppression mechanisms.Apart from the key role of mTOR in regulation of immune cell metabolism, particularly interesting data are related to the role of AMPK. AMPK is not only an important sensor ofthe cellular energy levels but through its potential inhibition by metformin may represent a potentially important pharmacological target for modulation of immunometabolism as well (5). Metformin, an activator of AMPK, inhibits Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation (76), while enhancing Treg through metabolic effects on fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis,leading to anti-inflammatory effects in vivo(151). This role of AMPK also provides a link between immunometabolism and oxidative stress.Therapeutic  implications  of  immunometabolism One of the key concepts of immunometabolism is related to the fact that immune cells can be reprogrammed by interfering with their metabolic states. This creates a possible therapeutic utility. M2 macrophage profile is promoted on inhibition of glycolysis (e.g., by inhibiting pyruvate kinase M2; 116). Similarly, proinflammatory IL-17 producing T Cells can be reprogrammed to develop into Treg-like cytokine producing profile by inhibition of glycolysis (e.g.,using 2-deoxyglucose).Immunometabolism of Diabetes Accumulating evidence suggests that development of vascular complications of diabetes is dependent on interactions between immune cells and vascular wall components(70, 141). Indeed, immune cell infiltration is a key feature linking obesity to diabetes, as proinflammatory cytokines,macrophages, and T cells are essential for the development of insulin resistance (110). Both innate immunity and adaptive immunity contribute to metabolic pathology. A classical example is that the activation of toll-like receptors, IL-1 receptor type I or TNF receptor, results in nuclear factor kappaB (NF-jB) and Jun amino-terminal kinase signaling, leading to insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 serine phosphorylation causing insulin resistance (112). Recognition of‘‘metabolic’’ danger signals (such as glucose, ATP, or cholesterol) by the nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family leads to activation of the NLR pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. This results in M1 macrophage activation (164). Abundance of fatty acids in obesity promotes AT inflammation in a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent manner (147). In healthy, nonobese individuals, Th2 and Treg residing in the fat have a beneficial effect by reducing visceral adipose tissue(VAT) inflammation. During obesity and other metabolic challenges, these cells are overwhelmed by proinflammatory CD8+cells and Th1 CD4+cells, which promote insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (174). CD4+T cells have been recognized as a central regulator of chronic VAT inflammation, as they can modulate macrophage- and other Tand B cell-dependent inflammatory responses. For example,IFN-c-producing Th1 cells enhance proinflammatory macrophage activation in the AT, and IL-17 produced by Th17 Cells may impair insulin receptor signaling in macrophages in culture and in surrounding AT (160). Th2 cells secreting IL-4 and IL-13 as well as the FOXP3+Treg induce, in turn, anti-inflammatory macrophages that release IL-10, inhibiting low-grade inflammation in VAT (35, 105). Further characterization of AT infiltrating T cells in obesity revealed that they represent features of senescence-associated T cells typically seen in aging in the secondary immune organs. They promote chronic VAT inflammation and metabolic disorders by secreting large amounts of osteopontin (148). These CD153+PD-1+CD44hi CD4+T cells are remarkably increased and preferentially accumulated in the VAT of high-fat diet-fed mice ina B cell-dependent manner. Indeed, B cells are critical for the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction(173). Treatment with a clinically available anti-CD20 antibody, which results in significant reductions of B cells, attenuates disease. In contrast, transfer of immunoglobulins G(IgGs) from obese mice to controls leads to the development of insulin resistance (173). B cells worsen glucose tolerance, inpart, by inducing proinflammatory cytokine production by T lymphocytes. Less evidence is available in the clinical setting, but insulin resistance in obese humans has been shown to be linked to elevated IgG autoantibodies (173) and immune cell accumulation in VAT, in particular, activated CD4+and CD8+T cells (177).While immune cells can promote insulin resistance and T2D, hyperinsulinemia, as previously discussed, alters immunity by promoting T cell activation as well as it increases T cell glucose uptake, amino-acid transport, and lipid metabolism (64). These changes promote overall decrease in IL-10 production with a parallel increase in production of IFN-c,thus promoting a pre diabetic inflammatory milieu (60).Immunometabolic Determinants of Vascular Dysfunction in T2DM While AT inflammation is essential for the development of insulin resistance, diabetes is associated with perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) inflammation, which leads to macrovascular and microvascular complications. We have recently shown that macrophage, T cell, and dendritic cell infiltration into PVAT precedes development of large vessel endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress (129, 150). Molecular mechanisms of PVAT inflammation include signal transducer and activator transcription 4 (STAT4) in adipocytes and immune cells. STAT4 deficiency reduces development of atherosclerosis and PVAT inflammation in apolipoprotein E(ApoE)-/-mouse (26) and in insulin-resistant obese Zucker Rats (126). The immune dysfunction linking diabetes to vascular disease includes T effector cell memory polarization (6)and  monocyte  subset  changes  toward  proinflammatory monocytes (103, 161, 171). PVAT inflammation is mediated by chemokines such as MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), or IP-10 (CXCL10) that recruit activated monocytes/macrophages and CD8+T cells to PVAT(51, 54, 70, 113). Infiltrating cells release cytokines such as IFN-c,TNF-a, or IL-6, which induce insulin resistance (19, 90,91) and impair endothelium-dependent relaxation (82, 102,103). IL-6 is also necessary for Th17 cell differentiation (14),another T cell subpopulation with strong proinflammatory impact on endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through activation of RhoA/Rho-kinase. It increases inhibitory endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)Thr 495 phosphorylation in ECs leading to decreased NO production (108). Inflammatory cytokines modulate smooth muscle cell constriction, proliferation, and migration (99).They also affect adipokine release. For example, TNF, IL-6,and IL-17A can all inhibit expression of adiponectin oromentin-1, the vasoprotective adipokines (33, 69, 84, 170), and stimulate proinflammatory leptin and resistin (84, 111). Leptin,through its structural similarity to the cytokines of the long-chain helical family such as IL-6, IL-12, and IL-15, can affect leukocyte activation, chemotaxis, and release of oxygen radicals. In vascular cells, it induces proliferation of VSMCs and expression of adhesion molecules on ECs and VSMCs (84).These aspects have been reviewed by us in detail elsewhere (58,113). It can also directly induce vascular dysfunction and oxidative stress (53, 57, 113) through possible effects on VSMC contractile function (176) and endothelial NO production.PVAT and Vascular Dysfunction While classically it is recognized that PVAT-derived adipokines and inflammatory cytokines affect EC and VSMC function, studies of human vascular dysfunction associated with metabolic impairment have led to a novel concept of an inside-to-outside signaling (Fig. 3; 7, 8, 96). According to this concept, bioactive compounds released from the vessel or the heart in conditions of increased oxidative stress can reciprocally control the biosynthetic activity of the neighbor-ing perivascular or epicardial AT (7, 8, 96). While the mediators of this bidirectional crosstalk are not clear, peroxidation products such as 4-hydroxynonenal that modulate gene expression within the PVAT or epicardial fatviaPPAR-c-dependent mechanisms have been shown (7, 8, 96). This may constitute an important mechanism through which endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress can affect metabolism of surrounding AT. VSMCs also regulate PVAT inflammation by releasing chemotactic factors and contributing to immune cell recruitment and activation. Strong evidence implicates metabolic regulation of VSMC controlled inflammation (130). Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, the first rate-limiting enzyme of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan (Trp) degradation, has immune regulation and anti-inflammatory mechanisms in vascular inflammation and, mainly through effects on Treg function, regulates vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1expression and vascular recruitment of macrophages in mice.Such effect can be reversed by exogenous administration of the Trp metabolite 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (130). Response of immune cells to VSMC-derived danger signals is also tightly regulated. For example, the innate immune protein CARD 9 in macrophages may mediate necrotic smooth muscle cell-induced inflammation by activating NF-jB and contribute to neointima formation in vascular remodeling (89).Finally, lymphatic vessel dysfunction is an emerging component of metabolic diseases (4). Lymphatics regulate tissue lipid accumulation, dyslipidemia, and edema. A recent study has demonstrated lymphatic dysfunction in diabetic db/db mice, which was rescued by L-arginine (140). These authors also demonstrated that PDE3 (phosphodiesterase 3)inhibition is required to maintain lymphatic vessel integrity and represents a viable therapeutic target for lymphatic endothelial dysfunction in metabolic disease (140). Thus, over the years it became apparent that vascular dysfunction associated with diabetes is closely regulated by coincident immune and metabolic dysregulation making immuno metabolic interventions a valuable therapeutic approach in the prevention and treatment of diabetic vascular disease.The Role of Epigenetics in Immunometabolic Regulation The concept that adverse chromatin remodeling contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular damage in T2D has been introduced (78). Epigenetics is an important modulator of gene expression without affecting DNA sequence(26). Epigenetics leads to heritable changes in phenotype(61). The major mechanisms of epigenetic regulation are represented by DNA methylation, post translational histone modifications, and RNA regulating molecules such as non-coding RNAs (Fig. 4).Histone  methylation  and  demethylation DNA methylation can inhibit gene transcription through the covalent attachment of a methyl group to cytosine residues in CpG islands (79). In the setting of diabetes, promoter hypomethylation leads to increased expression of genes involved in inflammation, adiposity,b cell dysfunction, and vascular damage (88). Excessive free radical production is a major player for the onset of endothelial damage and impaired functionality. A better understanding of epigenetic changes affecting oxidant genes may unmask new mechanistic perspectives. Pathological chromatin remodeling causes gene expression changes that persist even after control of cardiovascular risk factors. Hypomethylation of the oxidant genep66Shcis contributing to the hyperglycemic memory in experimental diabetes (121). Indeed, high glucose-exposed ECs (human) and T2D mouse aortas show p66Shc over expression after restoration to normal glucose levels (121). p66Shc upregulation and mitochondrial translocation induced free radical generation and impaired NO release. Global methylation status of leukocytes and B cells has been associated with insulin resistance and T2D (149, 187). Specific methylation changes were observed in TNF-a(65), ubiquitin-associated and SH3 domain-containing protein B (UBASH3B), or tripartite motif-containing 3 (TRIM3) genes involved in immune regulation(169). DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B is increased in macrophages exposed to high levels of saturated fatty acids,promoting M1 polarization in turn (181). Aberrant promoter DNA methylation also results in pathological endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and subsequent fibrosis(179). Perivascular inflammation in turn is greatly orchestrated by RANTES receptor CCR5(CC chemokine 5 receptor) gene methylation (102).Histone  acetylation  and  deacetylation Histone acetylation mark was the first post translational modification identified (77) and the field has rapidly developed with the identification of enzymes that can either acetylated or deacetylate histones (21) and therefore lead to an opening of chromatin and subsequent transcription of relevant genes. On the contrary, non acetylated histones are present in compact chromatin, also characterized by DNA hypermethylation at CpG. DNA and histone methyltransferase (DNMTs and HMTs), as well as histone acetyltransferase (HATs), are involved in plastic remodeling of chromatin as response to physiological and pathological stimuli (61). Together with histone deacetylases (HDACs) they regulate endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in T2D. One of the key families of deacetylases important in this setting are sirtuins (166),through the effects on vascular p66Shc gene transcription(SIRT1; 189). As a result, SIRT1 activation inhibits oxidative stress in the vessel wall and inhibits inflammation through prevention of NF-jB activation and cleavage of PARP—thepoly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (188). SIRT1 is downregulated in the AT of obese individuals leading to histone hyperacetylation, which enhances macrophage recruitment, TNF,IL-6, IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-13, IL-10, and IL-4 expression, and generalized AT inflammation (43).Through their effects on NF-jB activity, HATs and HDACs are important in controlling inflammation (166).HDAC3 regulates inflammatory genes in macrophages and HDAC2 contributes to resolution of inflammation (132).Role of SIRT1, HDAC4, enzyme involved in histone deacetylation is decreased in obesity and is correlated inversely to RANTES levels (2). T2D and T1D are both associated with increased H3 acetylation in the TNF-and COX2 (cyclooxygenase 2) promoter regions, while H3 K4 methylation renders dysfunctional monocytes through effects on NF-jB-dependent genes (132). Methylation of lysine residue 9 of histone 3 in lymphocytes affects their autoreactive potential in type 1 diabetes (100) and suppressing the H3K9 methylation is proinflammatory in the vasculature (136, 167).A growing body of evidence suggests that the mammalian methyltransferase Set7, involved in methylation of histones, may represent an important mechanism of vascular damage under hyperglycemic conditions (32, 114, 153). In bovine and human ECs exposed to high glucose, Set7 induces monomethylation of lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4m1) on the promoter of the RelA gene encoding for the transcription factor NF-jB p65. This epigenetic modification by Set7 favors NF-jB p65 upregulation and resulting overexpression of adhesion molecules (32, 114, 153). Interestingly, suppression ofSet7-dependent epigenetic changes prevented hyperglycemia-induced inflammation (32). Despite these data, the role of Set7in patients with diabetes mellitus remained unknown. Thus, we designed a study to investigate the link between Set7-induced chromatin changes and vascular phenotype in patients with T2D. Our findings demonstrated that a specific epigenetic signature induced by Set7 regulates NF-jB p65 expression and, hence, contributes to dysregulation of oxidant/inflammatory genes and endothelial dysfunction (118).Targeting this chromatin-modifying enzyme may represent a promising approach to maintain vascular homeostasis(186) and reduce oxidative and inflammatory burden in this setting.Noncoding  RNAs Micro RNAs (miRNAs) represent small noncoding RNAs that appear to play a key role regulating cardiovascular dysfunction in T2D (158). They post transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Microarrays have demonstrated a de-rangement of miRNA expression profile in patients with diabetes (185). Impairments of miRNAs involved in angiogenesis, inflammation, vascular repair, as well as endothelial homeostasis, have been reported (75, 104, 185). One of the hallmark studies has identified key miRNAs altered in subjects with T2D, as potential biomarkers. Lower plasma levels of miR-20b, miR-21, miR-24, miR-15a, miR-126, miR-191,miR-197, miR-223, miR-320, and miR-486 were seen in T2D and a modest increase of miR-28-3p. Importantly, reduced miR-15a, miR-29b, miR-126, miR-223, and elevated miR-28-3p levels antedated the manifestation of disease (185).Moreover, dysregulation of miRNAs within the AT, predominantly PVAT, has been linked to vascular disease, atherosclerosis, and aging (163). We recently investigated the miRNA landscape of the diabetic heart and its relationship with glycemic control (24). Our study was designed to address whether miRNAs may represent putative molecular driversof hyperglycemic memory in the diabetic myocardium. miR-NA landscape was assessed by miRNA polymerase chain re-action arrays in left ventricular specimens collected from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, with or without intensive glycemic control. We have shown that diabetes induces a profound alteration of miRNA expression in the heart and,most importantly, these detrimental signatures are not reverted by glycemic control (24). Such persistent alteration of several miRNAs orchestrating apoptosis, myocardial fibrosis, hypertrophy, autophagy, and redox signaling suggests the existence of hyperglycemic memory in the heart. Several miRNAs,which regulate inflammation, are decreased in T2D and aging,resulting in proinflammatory phenotype. MiR-21 has been widely associated with vascular aging and demonstrates concomitant effects on metabolic, inflammatory, and vascular mechanisms in the vessels and heart (Table 2; 29, 45, 180).While numerous other miRNAs have been implicated, miR-146b (resulting in monocyte activation), miR-107, (resulting in TLR4 expression and increased macrophage responses), miR-126 and miR-193b (resulting in enhanced chemotaxis) appear to be strongly linked to immunometabolism (132). Some pro adipogenic and proinflammatory miRNAs are increased inT2D such as miR-103 and miR-143, resulting in increased adipocyte growth, altered adipokine profile, and insulin resistance (178), while miR-23b or novel miR-1298 is involved in VSMC phenotypic switching (72, 142). MiRNAs can also provide a molecular link between metabolic dysfunction and development of some of its complications such as hypertension(18, 95). Table 2 summarizes selected key miRNAs, which have been shown repetitively to regulate metabolic, immune,and vascular functions and diseases. Over the next few years,we will learn more about other types of noncoding RNAs in immune regulation, such aslnc-DC, which targets STAT3 orLethe, which is induced by TNF and represses NF-jBtargetgenes. These interesting new developments are reviewed elsewhere (80).Oxidative Stress, Vascular Inflammation,and Endothelial Insulin Resistance Impaired insulin signaling and high glucose are strongly interlinked with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the setting of T2D (12, 56, 59, 154). This relationship is strongly mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), through their effects on vascular inflammation and dysfunction (42, 55, 172).Insulin resistance precipitates the development of T2D and CVD (117). While links between hyperglycemia and oxidative stress are relatively clear, much less is known regarding the pathways through which free radicals regulate insulin resistance. Unquestionably, ROS contribute to altered insulin sensitivity in ECs. These effects may be, in part, direct and, inpart, regulated by local low-grade inflammation promoted by oxidative stress. Vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis progression are directly linked to EC insulin signaling as demonstrated in ApoE-/-mice (27, 135). Indeed, endothelial-specific overexpression of the inhibitory subunit of nuclear factor-kappa B (Ij-Ba), which inhibits NF-jB activation,protects from insulin resistance in other organs (63). These findings cause a paradigm ‘‘shift’’ in the a dipocentric theory(81). The novel concept that insulin resistance may primarily start in the endothelium is also strengthened by the fact that the endothelium lines the entire vascular system. Endothelial release of NO is essential for capillary recruitment and,hence, appropriate insulin delivery to hormone-sensitive organs (73). Accordingly, insulin-mediated glucose uptake is reduced ineNOS-/-compared with wild-type (WT) mice(10). Previous work has suggested that oxidative stress isa potent mediator of insulin resistance in ECs (27). Indeed,overexpression of free radical scavengers uncoupling protein 1 or manganese superoxide dismutase can restore endothelial NOS and prostacyclin (PGI2) synthase activities, thus war-ranting insulin-dependent vasodilation and anti-inflammatory effects (27, 57). Moreover, vasodilatation induced by insulin may importantly regulate insulin-mediated glucose uptake (20,85, 133). Thus, restoration of endothelial function ( measured as flow-mediated dilatation in human arteries) is clearly linked with an improvement of insulin sensitivity (106, 168). Key mechanistic markers of endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress such as NF-jB activity or protein kinase C (PKC)b2 activity are elevated in the endothelium from patients with insulin resistance (50, 52, 155). In relation to this, we have recently studied the role of mitochondrial adaptor p66Shc in ROS-driven insulin resistance in the ECs. p66Shc silencing in vivo restored endothelial function through modulation of the IRS-1/AKT/eNOS (120). Knockdown of p66Shc in endothelium from obese mice blunted free radical production and free fatty acid oxidation, key events favoring insulin resistance. Suppression of p66Shc-derived oxidative stress prevented dysregulation of NF-jB, advanced glycation end product (AGE) precursor methylglyoxal, and PGI2 synthase, biochemical effectors of maladaptive insulin signaling(120). In hypertension, angiotensin II infusion stimulates T cells to produce TNF, and etanercept (TNF-a antagonist)blunts vascular superoxide production (51). In macrophages,in turn, TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK,Tnfsf12) and the receptor, fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) promote ROS production and enhance nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, which contributes to vascular damage and dysfunction in atherosclerosis (94).A turn away from the sole ‘‘adipocentric’’ view of metabolic dysfunction origins is further supported by studies in mice with vascular smooth muscle-targeted deletion of p22phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase (183). p22phox is essential for activity of Nox1, Nox2, and possibly Nox4 NADPH oxidase,while Nox5 (not expressed in mice) is p22phox independent(47–50, 52, 143). These mice have significantly reduced vascular oxidative stress and are protected from endothelial dysfunction in a number of pathological conditions. Interestingly,high-fat feeding did not induce weight gain or leptin resistance in these mice, which was associated with strongly reduced T Cell infiltration of perivascular fat. This is important as it indicates a causal immunometabolic link, suggesting that vascular dysfunction and inflammation may be primary, not secondary, in the development of obesity and insulin resistance(183). It also contributes to understanding of potential mechanisms of the inside-to-outside theory of the role of PVAT invascular disease.In T2D, increased glucose levels cause excessive free radical production from the mitochondria leading to the generation of AGEs, PKC activation, as well as increases inNF-jB (109). PKCb2 isoform is associated with endothelial dysfunction through its effects on ROS (155). PKCb2 elicits its deleterious effect through activation of mitochondrial and NADPH oxidases by regulating major components in ROS generation—namely p66Shc and p47phox phosphorylation (83, 117). PKC inhibitor inhibits the NADPH oxidase activity (46, 55, 131).p66Shc-/-mice are protected against hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress (17) and p66Shc expression is increased in lymphocytes and monocytes (PBMCs) from subject with T2D. Moreover, p66Shc expression is correlated with plasma ROS marker (isoprostanes; 115). PKCb2, important inROS generation, regulates of NF-jB signaling in response to high glucose by reducing its Ij-Ba. This results in inflammatory activation of the ECs with increased VCAM-1 expression (83).The role of NADPH oxidases in regulation of vascular inflammation in diabetes hypertension or atherosclerosis is well known, although recent studies have suggested additional important metabolic links. For example, Nox1-mediated increase in ROS induced by sphingosylphosphorylcholine leads to consequent enhancement of voltage-gated Ca2+entry and thus vasoreactivity (146). Although the understanding of the regulation of oxidant and inflammatory genes remains challenging, it is clearly emerging that targeting specific molecular machineries may represent an interesting therapeutic possibility to reduce CVD in the setting of metabolic disease.Pathways Linking Aging and Immunometabolism An increased body of evidence shows a link between ag-ing, CVD, and impaired metabolism. Not only aging impairs intracellular signaling triggering metabolic alterations but also metabolic conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance, anticipate vascular and cardiac senescence.It is emerging that a dynamic interplay among p66Shc, NAD-dependent deacetylase (Sirtuin 1; SIRT1), NF-jB, forkhead transcription factor (FOXO), AMPK, and activator protein-1(AP-1) transcription factor JunD underlines pathologic cardiovascular phenotypes in this setting. Recent studies have demonstrated that the adaptor p66Shc is an important molecular effector that may explain how aging relates to metabolic and CVD. Adaptor protein p66Shc is an important source of intracellular ROS (22). On the contrary,p66Shc-/-mouse models exposed to oxidative stimuli showed diminished ROS generation (16, 44). Several years ago, we observed that aging-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was not present inp66Shc-/-(38). Accordingly, NO availability was not reduced in aged p66Shc-/-mice (38). Activation of p66Shc is indeed involved in adipogenesis, insulin resistance, and diabetes-related cardiovascular  complications  (13,  17).More recently, as already mentioned, we demonstrated an upregulation of p66Shc in obese mice and the involvement in endothelial insulin resistance (120). Gene expression of p66Shc is increased in mononuclear cells obtained from patients with T2D and coronary artery disease (39, 115). Based On this background, it is possible to conclude that p66Shc fosters ROS accumulation, derangement of mitochondrial function, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Mitochondrial dysfunction is characterized in diabetes (heart) by changes in mitochondrial structure and, mechanistically, complex Idefect with oxidative stress results increased fatty acid oxidation (165). This effect is mediated by enhanced protein lysine acetylation (165).SIRT-1, a member of the family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent proteins termed sirtuins, has recently emerged as an important regulator of cardiovascular aging and inflammation (127). SIRT-1 protects the heart against aging features (3). Aging-induced SIRT-1 downregulation leads to the translocation of NF-jB p65 to the nucleus and hence increased expression of inflammatory genes (182).Epigenetic changes, such as increased DNA methylation and noncoding RNAs, modulate expression of sirtuins (30, 139,184). The maintenance of SIRT-1 homeostasis is crucial for the repression of pathways involved in arterial aging such as FOXO pathway (15). SIRT-1 also controls the release of protective factors such as recently identified Fgf21 in cardiac myocytes (128). Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT-1 protects against aging, impaired metabolic profiles, and cardiovascular complications (175). Among different compounds,resveratrol is an activator of SIRT-1. Resveratrol-increased SIRT-1 activity blunts the expression of oxidant and inflammatory genes by inducing epigenetic changes at the promoter level (34). Indeed, SIRT-1-induced histone deacetylation reduces the accessibility of transcription factors to chromatin, thereby blunting p66Shc gene expression(23, 123). Downregulation of sirtuins in this setting favors transcription of FOXO-dependent genes leading to apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, ROS generation, and impaired metabolism. NF-jB is a transcription factor expressed in mammalian cells (124). Its activation triggers inflammatory pathways in the heart and vessels. It was recently shown that silencing of endothelial NF-jB prolongs lifespan and improves endothelial insulin resistance in a mouse model of obesity. Selective endothelial overexpression of NF-jBinhibitory subunit was protective against insulin resistance in other tissues (63). Impaired insulin signaling is indeed an important hallmark linking metabolic disease with premature aging (134).JunD, which is a member of the AP-1 transcription factor family, is emerging as a key factor protecting from the development of vascular oxidative stress. AP-1 is a hetero- orhomodimeric complex made of proteins belonging to the c-Fos, c-Jun, ATF (activating transcription factor), and CREB(cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein) families(68). The cellular environment (infections, stress, cytokines,and growth factors) regulates gene expression via AP-1 (68).JunD regulates cell growth and survival, through affecting antioxidant gene expression (41). This results in the fact that JunD-/-mice are characterized by premature aging, shortened life span, and increased cancer development (86, 117,159). JunD overexpression decreased oxidative stress andblunted redox signaling resulting in diminished cellular apoptosis (41, 117).JunD-/-murine embryonic fibroblasts showed downregulation of antioxidant enzymes and increased NADPH oxidase expression (41). We demonstrated the relevance of JunD for cardiovascular homeostasis (122).We observed an aging-induced decrease of JunD expression leading to an imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant enzymes with increased ROS production. Indeed,young mice lacking JunD showed early impairment of redox signaling, mitochondrial derangement, and endothelial dysfunction (86). Furthermore, the vascular senescence observed in youngJunD-/-animals was similar to that observed in old WT mice. An adverse epigenetic remodeling occurring at the level of JunD promoter is responsible for such age-induced downregulation of JunD (86). This finding agrees with the notion that epigenetics affects the expression of genes involved in aging, dismetabolic profiles, and cardiovascular injury (159). In peripheral blood monocytes isolated from old compared to young healthy volunteers,JunD expression was reduced. In light of these findings,JunD can be considered as a promising target to prevent or delay age-induced CVD. Accordingly, disruption or up regulation of JunD expression promotes pressure-dependent cardiac apoptosis, hypertrophy, and angiogenesis (137) andblunt phenylephrine-mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy(66). In patients with severe heart failure, JunD protein expression is reduced (67).JunD-/-mice show hyperinsulinemia, as a result of oxidative stress-induced pancreatic islet vascularization (86). Interestingly, the metabolic derangements found inJunD-/-mice were rescued by treatment with antioxidants (86). These data clearly indicate that JunD is an important effector in the interaction among aging, metabolism, and CVD. Conclusion Vascular endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and low-grade inflammation are common features of metabolic diseases and are closely interlinked. Glucose metabolism affects immune phenotype and regulates oxidative stress generating enzymes affecting the development of all features of vascular dysfunction. Recent studies suggest that vascular dysfunction, endothelial insulin resistance, and vascular inflammation may precede and cause the development of insulin resistance, obesity, and T2D rather than being their mere consequence. This change from the classical ‘‘adipo-centric’’ theory of metabolic vascular disease may have significant diagnostic and therapeutic implications.Distinct epigenetic changes in vascular cells, adipocytes,and immune cells are frequently observed in obesity and T2D, and these are associated with phenotypic and functional alterations of these cells. Targeting these chromatin-modifying enzymes may represent a promising approach to reduce oxidative and inflammatory burden in the setting of diabetic vascular dysfunction.Acknowledgments This article was supported by grants from Narodowe Centrum Nauki of Poland (2011/03/B/NZ4/02454, to T.J.G.);European Research Council project No. 726318, Marie Curie CIG (No. 631773), British Heart Foundation Centre for Research Excellence (RE/13/5/30177), and from Vetenskapra ̊-det (No. 2016–02706), Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation(20140360), Konung Gustaf:Vs och Drottning Victorias Frimurarestift else (to F.C.).Author Disclosure Statement No competing financial interests exist.",-,"1. 2017 IDF.
